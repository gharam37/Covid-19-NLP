A complete 131 understanding of the characteristics of the disease is important for effective surveillance and 132 public health response measures to be implemented in a timely manner. Currently, although we 133 have some basic understanding of the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 134 patients, our knowledge is insufficient. This is because inconsistencies still exist in the findings 135 of many published reports, and the sample sizes in most of these reports were too small for a 136 reliable summary to be made.

      "In many instances, susceptibility to viral infections may be related to factors such as 141 gender and smoking habits (72-74). For the former, it is believed that X chromosome 142 inactivation in females may cause cellular mosaicism which ensures the presence of at least 143 one functional copy of X-linked immune genes, thus conferring women an increased resistance 144 against viral infections (75). In addition, estrogen, the major female sex hormone, is known to 145 promote adaptive immune response (76), while testosterone, the primary sex hormone in men, 146 could contribute to the suppression of the innate immune response, rendering men more 147 susceptible to viral infections (77, 78). On the other hand, cigarette smoking may reduce the 148 level of circulating immunoglobulins, immune cells, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as 149 disrupt the response of antibodies to antigens (72). For these reasons, some studies have 150 suggested that men and smokers are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infections (3, 79). In the 151 present work, we noted that the ratios of male to female and smokers to non-smokers were 152 close to 1:1. Although the relative risk or odds ratio of the association between these variables 153 and SARS-CoV-2 infection could not be computed due to the lack of a comparison group, a 154\n",

      "The present work also showed that the symptoms of COVID-19 were generally non-157 specific, thus the disease cannot be reliably distinguished from other infectious diseases based 158 on the symptoms alone. The most commonly observed symptoms were similar to those of the 159 previous coronavirus disease outbreaks (MERS and SARS), i.e. fever, cough, and myalgia or 160 fatigue. Nevertheless, compared to MERS and SARS, the proportion of afebrile patients was 161 much higher in COVID-19 (16.79% cf. 2% in MERS and 0-1% in SARS) (80). This indicates that 162 a significant number of COVID-19 patients would be missed if surveillance and monitoring 163 systems focus largely on temperature screening, as commonly practiced in airports (81, 82). 164\n",

      "The present work also showed that dyspnea was observed in only 16.97% of the patients. This 165 contradicts with advisories and guidelines published by many health authorities, which suggest 166 that dyspnea is a commonly observed symptom in . Besides, it was observed 167 that 0.80% of the patients were asymptomatic. Currently, whether asymptomatic patients can 168 transmit the virus to other individuals is not fully known, but it is highly possible (35). Thus, 169 although the number of asymptomatic patients was low, identifying and isolating such patients 170 to prevent uncontrolled disease spread would prove very challenging. It is therefore important 171 for diagnostic tests to be performed on asymptomatic medium-and high-risk individuals to 172 facilitate early detection and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In addition to nucleic acid 173 testing using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, some studies have 174 suggested the potential usability of chest CT for COVID-19 diagnosis (90, 91). However, in the 175 present work, we found that 5.86% of the patients did not have abnormalities on CT scans. Thus, 176 although CT findings have substantial accuracy in identifying the disease (90, 91), the results need 177 to be interpreted with caution. 178 179 SARS-CoV-2 is known to infect a cell by first binding to its angiotensin converting 180 enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (92).

      "Title : Integrative Bioinformatics Analysis Provides Insight into the Molecular Mechanisms of 2019-nCoV\n",
      "In early December 2019, several cases of pneumonia with unknown causes were reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China (1) . Later, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV was identified based on sequencing of the patient respiratory tract samples. As of February 1, 2020, more than 10,000 confirmed patients and more than 15,000 suspected cases were reported in China, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. Analyzing of the genome of 2019-nCoV showed that this new virus shared around 80~90% sequence identity to SARS-CoV (2) . Both bioinformatics modeling and in vitro experiments indicated that 2019-nCoV was more likely to use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entry receptor (3, 4) . ACE2 is previously known as the receptor for SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 (5, 6) . Considering the sequence of 2019-nCoV is similar to the SRAS-CoV and they are reported to share the same molecular as the entry point, analyses of ACE2 expression and distribution in lung and related biological processes may help us understand the pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for 2019-nCoV. Recent advances in bioinformatics enable researchers to reveal the underlying mechanisms of various diseases. In this study, we used bioinformatics approaches to identify the ACE2 expression features in lung and mine associated regulating networks. These results may help us understand the pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for 2019-nCoV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the 2019-nCoV infected patients, there are many patients with underlying diseases, such as chronic respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is important to evaluate whether patients with underlying diseases are more susceptible to coronavirus infection than healthy population. Firstly, we analyzed the expression of ACE2 in lung in the different populations. The expression level of ACE2 was not significantly altered between healthy populations and patients with chronic respiratory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and asthma ( Figure 1A , 1B, and 1C, p-value > 0.05). It indicated that 2019-nCoV . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n",

Thus, there may be no significant difference in the susceptibility of 2019-nCov infection between healthy population and patients with chronic respiratory diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, we found that the level of ACE2 expression was markedly upregulated in long-term smokers ( Figure 1D , p-value < 0.05). However, the p-value between baseline and post-acute smoke exposure (ASE) group (24 hours after smoking 3 cigarettes) was 0.073 ( Figure 1E ). It was assumed that the long-term smoking could elevate the expression of ACE2 and thus, increase the susceptibility to 2019-nCoV infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, we analyzed the expression of ACE2 in airway epithelial cells after being infected with SARS-CoV. The result suggested that 24 hours after SARS-CoV infection, the expression of ACE2 dramatically increased compared to 12 hours. After 48 hours, the expression of ACE2 remained at a high level. This indicated that ACE2 not only played a critical role in viral susceptibility but also may be involved in post-infection regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "To investigate the virus-related potential biological processes associated with ACE2, we extracted the expression profiles of 15 healthy non-smokers from dataset GSE89809 and divided them into two groups: high and low-expression level of ACE2.\n",
      "\n",
      "We performed GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) and found that the expression of ACE2 was mainly associated with innate and acquired immune responses, regulation of B cell mediated immunity, cytokine and IL-1，IL-10，IL-6，IL-8 secretion ( .

      "To further explore whether above activities could be triggered after coronavirus infection, we analyzed the expression profiles of epithelial cells which was infected by SARS-CoV. The biological process scores were obtained using GSVA (Gene Set Variation Analysis) and the pearson correlation between process scores and ACE2 expression was calculated. Similarly, while ACE2 increased after infection, production of cytokines, IL-1, IL-10 and IL-6 also increased, and the regulation of B cell activation was triggered to response. After 48 hours, virus activities such as viral entry into the host cell, virus life cycle, and viral transcription were enhanced. Besides, the T-cell cytokine secretion was increased, and T-cell activation was promoted ( Figure 2B ). Then, we used ssGSEA (Single Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) to quantify the immune infiltrates in healthy people epithelial cells and cells after infection. We found that in normal samples, the immune cells were not activated so that the correlation between infiltration and ACE2 expression was not significant ( Figure 2C ). However, in the SARS-CoV infected cells, the ACE2 was significantly correlated with neutrophils, NK cells, Th17 cells, Th2 cells, Th1 cells, DC ( Figure   2D ).\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering higher expression of ACE2 was involved in mediating inflammatory responses, immune activities, and viral replication in both healthy individuals and infected cells, we further explored protein-protein regulation network in viral activity-related proteins and cytokine secretion, respectively. We extracted the viral activity-associated and cytokine secretion-associated proteins from the Gene ontology (GO) biological process gmt file. Construction of the Protein-protein interaction (PPI) showed that these proteins were tightly interactive among each other and we here exhibited the most significant PPI. In terms of viral activity, we found that \"viral gene expression\" proteins such as RPS3, RPS8 and PRS25 were the most important genes in the PPI network. In addition, VCP, LARP1, UBA52, PRKN, EIF3A and EIF3L\n",

It has been shown that RPS3 plays an important role in cell mitosis by interacting with αtubulin.

      "The December 2019 outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, has led to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic Zhou et al., 2020) . The highly contagious nature of the disease as well as the lack of vaccines or clinically approved treatments has caused a worldwide public health emergency. Therefore, improved and timely understanding of the human susceptibilities to SARS-CoV-2 will prove invaluable in controlling the pandemic and treatment of those affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "SARS-CoV-2 enters cells using two host cellular proteins: angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). The virus first employs ACE2 as a cell entry protein, followed by TMPRSS2-mediated proteolytic processing of the SARS-2 spike protein, further facilitating viral entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . Targeting the activity or expression of both factors by a plethora of approaches has been proposed as potential treatment (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Stopsack et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) .\n",
      "\n",
      "TMPRSS2 is also a widely studied androgen-regulated gene in prostate tissue, contributing to prostate cancer pathogenesis by way of aberrantly driving oncogene expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Approximately half of all prostate cancers harbor a fusion that juxtaposes a TMPRSS2 transcriptional regulatory element, which is stimulated by potent androgens and the androgen receptor (AR), in front of an ERG oncogene. (Tomlins et al., 2005) . The end result is AR stimulation of oncogene expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "This raises the possibility that the physiological roles of androgens may, at least partially, account for the sex-specific clinical outcomes (Grasselli et al., 2020; Sharon Moalem, 2020) . Due to its androgen-regulated nature in the prostate and its essential role in SARS-Cov-2 etiology, TMPRSS2 expression has been postulated to follow a similar pattern of regulation in pulmonary cells by the potent androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (Mikkonen et al., 2010) . If this link proves correct, it could pave the path to novel strategies, including re-purposing of FDA-approved potent androgen synthesis inhibitors or AR antagonists, such as enzalutamide (Enz) and apalutamide, for the treatment of COVID-19.\n",

      "Here, we show that there is no evidence for increased TMPRSS2 expression in the lungs of males. On the other hand, cigarette smoking increases the levels of pulmonary TMPRSS2 mRNA, which drop back to never-smoker levels after quitting smoking.

Interestingly, despite similar transcript levels, we found AR protein levels are substantially higher in lungs of male mice compared with females. This finding, conditional upon validation in human samples, may yet help explain sex differences in COVID-19 outcomes, but likely in a manner that is independent of TMPRSS2 regulation.\n",

Furthermore, certain pulmonary disease process outcomes, including asthma, are sex steroid associated (Zein et al., 2020) . Therefore, we sought to investigate whether male sex was associated with higher expression of TMPRSS2 or AR in human lung.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this end, we acquired the publicly available expression datasets for TMPRSS2 and AR in non-cancerous lung and associated respiratory tissues from the Genomic Expression Omnibus (GEO). Across all tissue-type comparisons, we found no evidence for elevated TMPRSS2 or AR mRNA expression ( Fig.1 ) in males compared with females. Together, these results suggest that worse clinical manifestations of men with COVID-19 are unlikely to be associated with TMPRSS2. However, this conclusion is limited to transcriptional information, and further studies are required to rule out the possibility of protein level differences in the human respiratory system.\n",
      "\n",
      "To further explore sex differences in TMPRSS2 expression in animal models, we harvested lungs from female and male mice treated with control diet or Enz for > 10 days and analyzed them for protein and mRNA expression. In the case of TMPRSS2, this yielded results consistent with human expression data: i.e., there were no sex-specific changes. Additionally, Enz treatment did not downregulate TMPRSS2 ( Fig. 2A and B) . Given the unchanged AR protein levels (despite a modest but statistically significant mRNA increase) in Enz-treated males, we infer that TMPRSS2 is not regulated by AR in the lung.

      "\n",
      "Similar to TMPRSS2 and also consistent with human data, we found no evidence of sexspecific changes in AR transcript levels of mice ( Fig. 2A) . However, the lungs of male mice express considerably higher amounts of AR protein compared with females ( Fig. 2B ). This finding begs the question whether human lungs also follow a sex-discordant pattern of AR protein synthesis or if this is a mouse-specific phenomenon. If the former, androgen-ARmediated changes may yet explain sex-specific differences in COVID-19 outcomes by TMPRSS2-independent mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to male sex, smoking is a risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and poor clinical outcomes . One recent study of 1,099 COVID-19-positive patients reported a more than two-fold increased risk for intensive care unit admission and death in smokers as compared with non-smokers (Guan et al., 2020) . We identified human expression GEO datasets of bronchial/airway epithelial cells containing subject smoking status and asked whether smoking is associated with TMPRSS2 expression. Our analysis indicated a consistent pattern where expression of both TMPRSS2 (Fig. 3A ) and the primary SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 ( Fig.3B ) was modestly but significantly increased in smokers compared with non-smokers. Interestingly, the levels were downregulated to never-smoker levels in former smokers.

For COVID-19, potential androgen-mediated biologic differences include 1) TMPRSS2 regulation and 2) immune modulation (Sharifi and Ryan, 2020; Stopsack et al., 2020) . Our study addresses the first of these possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although AR protein is clearly expressed in the male mouse lung at levels higher than in females, we find no evidence for androgen regulation of TMPRSS2. This evidence includes 1) the absence of any TMPRSS2 increase in male compared with female human lung 2) no TMPRSS2 increase in male compared with female mouse lung 3) no evidence for TMPRSS2 suppression with next generation AR antagonist treatment. Therefore, given that AR protein is higher in male lungs, it is possible that AR-dependent transcription in the male lung mediates biologic differences independent of TMPRSS2 expression that are important for driving sex-dependent differences in clinical outcomes. This has yet to be determined.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limitations of our study include the fact that we cannot rule out cell type-specific differences in sex-associated or androgen-dependent TMPRSS2 regulation in pulmonary tissues. Nevertheless, early autopsy studies of COVID-19 appear to show diffuse viral damage that may suggest that the expression of viral host cell receptors is likely not limited to an isolated pulmonary subset of cells (Barton et al., 2020) . Although we did perform immunohistochemical staining studies for TMPRSS2 expression in the mouse lung, we encountered different patterns compared to human prostate tissue, in which TMPRSS2 is a membrane/cell surface protein. The mouse lung lacked cytoplasmic and membrane staining but expressed significant nuclear stain. This led us to conclude that much of the antibody binding in mouse was non-specific.\n",

Pulmonary TMPRSS2 regulation appears not to account for the sex-discordance in COVID-19 clinical outcomes. In contrast, both TMPRSS2 and ACE2 appear to have increased expression in current smokers. It is not yet known whether these changes in expression have a functional impact on COVID-19 infection, but if they do, the results suggest smokers could partly mitigate their increased risk by quitting smoking. This also raises the question of whether other hazards such as high levels of air pollution could have similar effects. Nevertheless, a recent study reports that ACE2 expression is not upregulated by lung disease or exposure to carcinogens (Smith and Sheltzer, 2020) .

The receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein has a higher binding affinity for human ACE2 than SARS-CoV 36, 41 , whereas the interaction with CD147 (encoded by the gene BSG), another reported receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, is weak (CD147: Kd, 0.185 µM vs hACE2: Kd, ~15 nM) 42 . Following receptor binding, the virus gains access to the host cell cytosol through acid-dependent proteolytic cleavage of the S protein. For SARS-CoV, a number of proteases including TMPRSS2 and CTSL cleave at the S1 and S2 boundary and S2 domain (S2') 43 to mediate membrane fusion and virus infectivity. For SARS-CoV-2, both pharmacological inhibition of endogenous TMPRSS2 protein and TMPRSS2 overexpression support a role for TMPRSS2-mediated cellular entry 37, 44 .\n",

      "The identification of the specific cell types that can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 will inform our understanding of disease transmission and pathogenesis, which are often cell context-specific. Studies suggest that key infection routes involve the nasal passages, airways, and alveoli, where epithelial cells play a key barrier role. Identifying putative target cells in other organs could inform our understanding of extra-pulmonary COVID-19 associated organ failure or of potential placental transmission. Early analyses of the Human Lung Cell Atlas revealed that some of the cells of the nasal passages, airways, alveoli, and gut co-express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 45, 46 .\n",

      "Here, we perform integrated analysis of 107 single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq studies, including 22 studies of the lung and airways, and 85 additional studies of other diverse tissues, spanning both published and unpublished datasets. We comprehensively define the expression patterns of the ACE2 viral receptor and accessory proteases genes. We test how their expression is related to age (from prenatal to old age), sex, and smoking status. We identify gene expression programs associated with cells that can be infected by the virus and compare these programs across specific cell types, organs, and species. To further inform future studies, we assess the conservation of these human features in mouse models and explore the expression of other proteases that may play a role in the viral replication cycle.\n",

      "line with the kidney's role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, dual-positive cells are enriched in the proximal tubular cells and in principal cells of the collecting duct (Fig. 1a,c) . Interestingly, brain oligodendrocytes, multiciliated and sustentacular cells in olfactory epithelium, AT1 cells in non-smoker lung, and ductal cells in pancreas -all ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + -were also all enriched for MYRF, a transcription factor necessary for myelination in the brain and sufficient to induce expression of the myelin proteins MOG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) and MBP (myelin basic protein) 54 . ACE2 + CTSL + cells were enriched in additional subsets, associated with COVID-19 pathology, most notably the olfactory epithelium, ventricular cardiomyocytes, heart macrophages, and pericytes in multiple tissues, including the heart, lung, and kidney (Fig. 1d) .\n",
      "\n",
      "The presence of dual-positive cells in the lung, heart, and kidney may reflect that cells in these organs may be direct targets of viral infection and pathology 5, 55 . Dual-positive cells in the sustentacular and basal cells of the olfactory epithelium (Fig. 1c) may be associated with a loss of the sense of smell 56 . Dual-positive cells in the corneal and conjunctival epithelium, may contribute to viral transmission 4, 57 . Dual positive cardiomyocytes may be related to \"direct\" cardiomyocyte damage (see Tucker et al. companion manuscript 58 ), whereas heart pericytes may indicate a vascular component to the cardiac dysfunction, and could contribute to increased troponin leak in patients without coronary artery disease. Notably, ACE2-expressing heart pericytes in another dataset (Tucker et al) is even higher (30%) than any other tissue dataset analyzed here (max. 21 .7% in kidney, Extended Data Fig. 4) . Despite the lymphopenia observed with COVID-19 2,4,59,60 , we did not typically observe ACE2 mRNA expression in scRNA-seq profiles in the bone marrow or cord blood (Fig. 1a,b) , although there was ACE2 expression in some tissue macrophages, including alveolar and heart macrophages (Extended Data Fig. 4) . Further studies of ACE2 RNA and protein expression in COVID-19 disease tissue will help elucidate its expression in immune cells 61 .\n",

      "To validate our findings from scRNA-seq analysis and to determine the spatial expression patterns of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL, and their corresponding proteins we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry on tissue sections of airway and alveoli from healthy donor lungs that were rejected for lung transplantation.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we performed triple fluorescence in situ hybridization to identify ACE2, CTSL and TMPRSS2 on alveolar sections. We observed co-expression, albeit at low levels, of all three genes in alveolar cells (Fig. 1e) . We then performed co-staining with cell type-specific markers. We observed ACE2 transcripts in a subset of type 2 (AT2) cells identified by canonical AT2 protein markers, HTII-280 and pro-SFTPC (Fig. 1f,g) . Similarly, we observed TMPRSS2 gene expression in HTII-280+ AT2 cells (Fig. 1f) . Immunostaining for TMPRSS2 protein further confirmed AT2 cell expression (Extended Data Fig. 5a) . We also observed TMPRSS2 protein expression at low levels in some AT1 cells identified by the canonical AT1 protein marker AGER (Extended Data Fig. 5a) . Of note, some non-epithelial cells also expressed these three genes. We further validated the expression of ACE2 by bulk mRNA-seq in sorted AT2 cells, including those from long-term cultured alveolar organoids (Extended Data Fig. 5b) . We then performed immunohistochemistry and deployed three different available putative ACE2 antibodies to establish ACE2 protein expression (Supplementary Table 4 ). One of these 3 antibodies, the one used previously to functionally block cellular viral entry, specifically labeled adult pro-SFTPC-positive AT2 cells (Extended Data Fig. 5c) . As a cautionary note, the lack of agreement between antibody staining patterns suggests that some of these antibodies may be non-specific.\n",

      "Previous studies have revealed that ACE2 is highly enriched in mucous cells of the nasal and lower respiratory tract epithelium . In healthy lungs, both large and small airways contain mucous cells in surface airway epithelium, albeit at low numbers. However, submucosal glands (SMGs) that reside deep within the airway tissues are composed of abundant mucous cells. To test whether these mucous cells also express ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL, we performed an integrated analysis on scRNA-seq datasets obtained from microdissected SMGs of the healthy donors. We observed overlapping expression and relatively high enrichment of AEC2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL in mucous cells of the SMGS (Extended Data Fig. 5e ). In situ transcript analysis for ACE2 further confirmed the presence of transcripts in acinar epithelial cells of the SMGs (Fig. 1h) , and cells expressing ACE2 in the large airway epithelium (Fig. 1i) .\n",
      "\n",
      "We next sought to understand how the expression of each of these three key genes --ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL --in specific cell subsets may relate to three key covariates that have been associated with disease severity: age (older individuals are more severely affected), sex (males are more severely affected), and smoking (smokers are more severely affected) 62 . We integrated samples across many studies, as no single dataset generated to date is sufficiently large to address this question. We assembled 22 datasets (Supplementary Table 2 , Supplementary Data File D3), comprised of 1,176,683 cells from 164 individuals, spanning 282 healthy nasal, lung, and airway samples profiled by scRNA-seq or snRNA-seq from either biopsies, resections, entire lungs that could not be used for transplant, or post mortem examinations, allowing us to study a diversity of respiratory regions and cell types (Fig. 3a) . These included 6 published datasets 63-68 and 16 datasets that are not yet published [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] . In the case of unpublished data, we only obtained singlecell expression counts for the three genes, as well as the total UMI counts per cell, cell identity annotations, and the relevant anonymous clinical variables (age and sex, as well as smoking status when ascertained). Cell identity annotations were manually harmonized using an ontology with three levels of annotation specificity (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Table 2 ); focusing on levels 2 and 3 allowed us to include a large number of datasets, while retaining relatively high cell subset specificity (Fig. 3a,b) . To facilitate rapid data sharing, we analyzed data pre-processed by each data-generating team at the level of gene counts, using total counts as a size factor. We used Poisson regression (diffxpy package; Methods) to model the association between the expression counts of the three genes and age, sex, and smoking status, and their possible pair-wise interactions (Fig. 3c) , using total counts as an offset, and dataset as a technical covariate to capture sampling and processing differences. It should be noted that modeling interaction terms was crucial as their omission resulted in reversed effects for age and sex for particular cell types (Discussion). This model was fitted to non-fetal lung data (761,693 cells, 165 samples, 77 donors, 10 datasets) within each cell type to assess cell-type specific association of these covariates with the three genes. To further validate sex and age associations, we fit a simplified version of the model without smoking status covariates to the full non-fetal lung data (986,342 cells, 225 samples, 125 donors, 16 datasets).\n",
      "\n",
      "Uncertainty is challenging to model in our single-cell meta-analysis as variability exists on the levels of both donors and cells. For simplicity, we modeled the overall variance with both contributions covered implicitly by treating each cell as an independent observation. As cells from the same donor cannot be typically regarded as independent observations, this can result in inflated p-values, especially when there are few donors for a particular cell type. To counteract this limitation, we employed three approaches: (1) We used a simple noise model (Poisson) to reduce the chance of overfitting donor variability to obtain spurious associations; (2) We confirmed significant associations from the single-cell model in a pseudo-bulk analysis to ensure effect directions are consistent when modeling only donor variation (Methods, Fig. 3d , Extended Data Fig. 6, 7, 8, Supplementary Data D1) ; and, (3) We investigated whether significant associations change direction when holding out any one dataset to ensure that the effect is not dominated by the inclusion of many cells from only one source (Methods, Fig. 3f, Supplementary Data D1) . We regarded an association that passes all of these validations as a robust trend, while associations that appear dominated by a single dataset (often because this dataset is a major contributor of a given cell type) were denoted as indications.\n",
      "\n",
      "We focused on trends or indications in those cell types where both TMPRSS2 and ACE2 are predominantly expressed in the lung: airway epithelial cells (basal, multiciliated, and secretory cells), alveolar AT2 cells, and submucosal gland secretory cells (Fig. 3e) . Strikingly, we find robust trends of ACE2 expression with age, sex, and smoking status in these cell types (Fig. 3d , Extended Data Fig. 6 and MALTE4): ACE2 expression increases with age in basal and multiciliated cells. ACE2 expression is elevated in males in airway secretory cells and alveolar AT2 cells. Furthermore, we find strongly elevated levels of ACE2 in past or current smokers in multiciliated cells (log fold change (log FC): 1.52, Fig. 3d ). Significant associations of ACE2 expression indicate increased expression with age in AT2 (largest age effect: slope of log expression per year of 0.020) and secretory cells, and increased expression of ACE2 in males in multiciliated cells. Further indications associate past or current smoking with decreased ACE2 expression in AT2 cells, and increased ACE2 expression in basal cells. However, these last five indications are not robust trends and depend on the inclusion of a single dataset (Fig. 3f) , often because that dataset contributes a large number of cells of a particular type. Specifically, when we held out the largest declined donor transplant dataset (Supplementary Table 2 , \"Regev-Rajagopal\", most cells and most samples), a declined donor tracheal epithelium dataset (\"Seibold\", Supplementary Table 2 , most donors in the smoking analysis), or a further declined donor lung dataset (\"Kropski-Banovich\", Supplementary Table 2 ) respectively, the effect is no longer present (Methods, Fig. 3f , Supplemenatry Data D1).\n",
      "\n",
      "The above trends and indications for sex and age were further validated in the simplified model on the full non-fetal lung dataset (Extended Data Fig. 8, Supplementary Data D2) . With the exception of the age association in basal and secretory cells, all associations were found to be significant at a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 5%, confirmed by pseudo-bulk analysis, and were supported at least at the level of indication. Indeed, all robust trends were also supported as robust trends in the simplified model. Fitting the simplified model on the smoking data subset shows that modeling smoking status is crucial to detect the basal and secretory age association. Without modeling the effect of smoking status on basal and secretory cell ACE2 expression, this variance is captured as uncertainty against which the age effect is evaluated as not significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking into account smoking status is of particular importance as the effect sizes associated with smoking tend to be much larger than age effects, and tend to be larger than sex effects. For example, in multiciliated cells the effect sizes assigned to smoking status, sex, and age associations with ACE2 expression are β=1.52, β=0.51, and β=0.0107 respectively, where β represents the log FC and the slope of log expression per year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examining joint trends of ACE2 and the protease genes within the same cell type, there are indications of up-regulation of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in multiciliated cells (ACE2 indication dependent on \"Seibold\" dataset) in males and with age (both indications dependent on \"Regev-Rajagopal\" dataset). In AT2 cells, there is an indication of joint up-regulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with age (dependent on \"Regev-Rajagopal\" dataset), and an indication of ACE2 and CTSL down-regulation in smokers (dependent on \"Kropski-Banovich\" dataset). All above joint trends for age and sex covariates were confirmed on the full non-fetal lung data using the simple model without smoking covariates.\n",
      "\n",
      "In aggregate, elevated levels of cell-type specific ACE2 and associated proteases are correlated to increasing age, in smokers, and in males.\n",
      "\n",
      "The age associations highlighted particularly low expression in samples from very young children (newborn to 3 years old). As reports suggest that most infants and young children cases do not display severe disease 11, 74 , we inspected the subsets of studies of human development and pediatric samples from our integrated analysis (Supplementary Table 2 ). These included cells from 12 first trimester samples (8 donors) of fetal lung (8.5 weeks post conception; wpc), 29 fetal lung samples (26 donors) from the second trimester (13-24 weeks) 68 , 13 lung samples (10 donors) spanning from third trimester premature births (n=4), full term newborns (n=1), ~3-month old (n=4), 3-year-old (n=3), and 10-year-old (n=1) children. Because the number of samples here is small, all observations must be interpreted with caution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The extent of ACE2 expression in lung cells changes during development (Fig. 3g , Supplementary Table 5 ). There are dual-positive cells present in the very early first trimester lungs by scRNA-seq, and some ACE2 expression in epithelial cells in the second trimester samples (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b) . Notably, spatial transcriptomics of 8.5 pcw fetal lung did not capture any ACE2 expression (data not shown). In lungs from third trimester pre-term births, ACE2 expression is high, with ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells observed in alveolar AT2 cell populations (Extended Data Fig. 3b) .\n",
      "\n",
      "Strikingly, ACE2 expression is very low in normal lungs of newborns, the one ~3 months' lung sample, and the 3-year-old lungs (Fig. 3g) . This is further supported by single-cell chromatin accessibility by transposome hypersensitive sites sequencing (scTHS-Seq 75 ) from human pediatric samples (full gestation, no known lung disease) collected at day 1 of life, 14 months, 3 years, and 9 years (n=1 at each time point) (Extended Data Fig. 9a) . ACE2 gene activity scores (Methods), when present, were in the AT1/AT2 population, but no signal was present at birth, it was low in the 9-year-old and 3-year-old sample, and higher in the 14 month-old (Extended Data Fig. 9b-d) .\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the ~3 month-old infant lung also showed fewer ACE2immunoreactive AT2 cells (Extended Data Fig. 5d ).\n",
      "\n",
      "We also assessed whether ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL are expressed in the human placenta during pregnancy, using data from three published scRNA-seq studies: two from the first trimester (64,000 cells and 14,000 cells) and one from full-term placenta (20,518 cells) [76] [77] [78] . ACE2 was expressed (1.4%) in maternal decidual/stromal cells, maternal pericytes, and fetal extravillous trophoblasts, cytotrophoblasts, and syncytiotrophoblast in both first-trimester and term placenta (Fig. 1d) . Note that there was little expression of TMPRSS2 (0.2%) in the placenta and accordingly few ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + dual-positive cells (as we previously reported 45 ). However, CTSL is expressed in most cells (56%) in the maternal-fetal interface, and there are ACE2 + CTSL + dualpositive cells (1.3%) among maternal decidual/stromal cells, pericytes, and fetal trophoblasts (HLA-A, B negative) in both first-trimester and term placentae.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, these patterns may be important in understanding why children are more resistant to COVID-19 and and in considering risk during pregnancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Human Lung Cell Atlas analyses have revealed immune signaling genes that co-vary with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in airway and lung cells 45, 46 . These analyses identified antiviral response genes that are enriched in ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells (e.g., IDO1, IRAK3, NOS2, TNFSF10, OAS1, MX1), and suggested that ACE2 itself is interferon regulated 45, 46 .\n",
      "\n",
      "To explore such gene programs in a broader context, we identified signatures for dual-positive ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells compared to dual-negative ACE2 -TMPRSS2cells in the nasal epithelium, lung, and gut (Supplementary Tables 6, 7 8) with two complementary approaches. The first aimed to find features that characterize programs of dual positive cells that are shared by different cell types in one tissue (\"tissue programs\"). The second aimed to find features that are associated with dual positive cells compared to other cells of the same type, and may or may not be shared with other types (\"cell programs\") (Methods). To infer tissue programs, we trained a random forest classifier to discriminate between dual-positive and dual-negative cells (excluding ACE2 and TMPRSS2; 75:25 class balanced test-train split), generalizing across multiple cell types in one tissue, and ranked genes according to their importance scores in the classifier (Methods). To infer cell programs, we performed differential expression analysis between dual-positive and dualnegative cells within each cell subset. We note that ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells have more unique transcripts detected (Extended Data Fig. 10b) : this can reflect a technical confounder, biological features, or both. We conservatively controlled for these differences (by sampling dual positive and dual negative cells from matched gene complexity bins; Methods; Extended Data Fig. 10b , Extended Data Fig. 11) . Importantly, these methods do not assume that ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells form a distinct subset within each cell type. Rather, our goal is to leverage the variation among single cells within a single type to identify gene programs that are co-regulated with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 within each expressing cell subset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tissue programs (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 10a 10a for visualization of selected genes, and Supplementary Tables 6 for the full list). These include phagosome structure, antigen processing and presentation, and apoptosis. Among the tissue program genes we highlight: CEACAM5 (lung, nasal, gut programs) and CEACAM6 79 (lung), surface attachment factors for coronavirus spike protein; SLPI (lung, nasal), a secreted protease inhibitor that is associated with virus resistance 80 ; PIGR (lung, gut), the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor that may promote antibody-dependent enhancement via IgA 81 ; and, CXCL17 (lung, nasal), a mucosal chemokine that attracts dendritic cells and monocytes to the lungs 82 . In addition, the tissue programs yielded multiple genes that are associated with cholesterol and lipid metabolic pathways and endocytosis (DHCR24, LCN2, FASN); high expression of both MHC I (B2M, HLA-B) and MHC II (HLA-DRA, DRB1, CTSS, CD74) pathways, expanding on prior evidence that AT2 cells can serve as antigen presenting cells in infection 83 ; genes indicating preparation against cellular injury through ROS inhibition, preventing proteases, or through antiviral responses (interferons, extracellular RNAse, etc: PLAC8, TXNIP); complement genes (C3, C4BPA); genes involved in immune modulation (BTG1); and, tight junction genes (DST, CLDN3, CLDN4).\n",
      "\n",
      "The cell programs (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 11a ,b, Supplementary Table 6 ) were enriched in many of the same genes and pathways as tissue-specific programs (Fig. 4d , Supplementary Table 6 ,7,8,9,10), and highlight a potential role for TNF signaling in ACE2 regulation. We first confirmed that the cell programs were not merely associated with the number of transcripts per cell (Extended Data Fig. 11c) . While some genes were shared between the tissue and cell programs (e.g., many virus-related genes, such as CEACAM5, CXCL17, SLPI, and HLA-DRA), the cell programs further captured unique biological functions and activities. For example, dual positive lung secretory cells differentially expressed genes involved in TNF signaling including RIPK3, a key regulator of inflammatory cell death via necroptosis, previously implicated in SARS-CoV pathogenesis 84 . Both lung dual positive secretory and multiciliated cells differentially expressed lysosomal genes (MFSD8, CTSS, CTNS, CTSH), potentially relevant for endolysosomal entry of coronaviruses 85 . Dual positive AT1 cell programs included genes involved in immunoproteasome (PSMB8, PSMB9, Fig. 4c) , class I and II antigen presentation (HLA-DMA, HLA-DRB5, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DRA, HLA-DPA1), and phagocytosis. Dual-positive nasal goblet cells differentially expressed several cytokines and chemokines, including granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (CSF3), which may impact hematopoiesis, the recruitment of neutrophils, and inflammatory pathology; CXCL1 and CXCL3, chemoattractants for neutrophils; interleukin-19 (IL19), which induces the production of IL-6 and TNF 86 ; and CCL20, which is upregulated by TNF 87 . The AT2 cell program included the surfactant proteins, SFTPA1 and SFTPA2; the IL-1 receptor (IL1R1), which may promote antiviral immune responses (below); and, multiple components of MHC-II (e.g., HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1), congruent with a role in antigen presentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cell programs from multiple tissues (Fig. 4c,d) included genes related to TNF signaling (e.g., BIRC3, CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL2, JUN, NFKB1), raising the possibility that anti-TNF therapy may impact the expression of ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2. Consistent with this hypothesis, ACE2 expression in enterocytes was significantly lower in ulcerative colitis patients treated with anti-TNF compared to untreated patients (mean = 0.22 and 0.13 log2(transcripts per 10,000 (TP10K)+1) in treated vs. untreated; adjusted P < 1e-3). However, we could not control for many important features, including disease severity, which is strongly associated with anti-TNF treatment, raising the need for future work. Some of the genes are targets of known drugs 88 . For example, dualpositive lung secretory cells expressed, in addition to ACE2 (targeted by ACE inhibitors), other drug targets, including C3, HDAC9, IL23A, PIK3CA, RAMP1, and SLC7A11. Other program genes were shown to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins via affinity purification mass spectrometry 89 . Among those was GDF15, which was identified as a putative interaction partner for the SARS-CoV-2 protein Orf8 89 , is a central regulator of inflammation 90 , and was a member of the dual-positive cell programs of both lung basal cells and nasal multiciliated cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some program genes may be particularly related to COVID19 pathological features and may indicate putative therapeutic targets. For example, MUC1 is especially highly induced in dualpositive cells (in tissue and specific cell programs), which may be associated with respiratory secretions 91 . Importantly, the lung tissue and gut enterocyte programs include the gene encoding the IL6 co-receptor (IL6ST), and the AT2 cell program includes IL6. IL6 signaling has been implicated in uncontrolled immune responses in the lungs of COVID19 patients, elevated serum IL6 levels are associated with the need for mechanical ventilation 92 , and anti-IL6R antibodies (tocilizumab) are being tested for clinical efficacy in COVID-19 patients. Indeed, IL6ST and IL6 are higher in dual positive vs. dual negative AT2 cells (Extended Data Fig. 11d) , although IL6 expression is relatively low in these cells from healthy tissue. Additional cell types, such as heart pericytes, are enriched for cells with co-expression of ACE2 with IL6R or IL6ST (Extended Data Fig. 12 ).\n",
      "\n",
      "The immune-like features of ACE2 + epithelial cells are also reflected in the regulatory features of the ACE2 locus by scATAC-Seq (Fig. 4f) . Epithelial cells (AT1, AT2, secretory, multiciliated, ionocytes, and neuroendocrine cells) with open chromatin at the ACE2 locus show high motif activity scores 93 for interferon-regulatory factors such as IRF1/7 (MA0050.1, adj p-val=0.02, MA0772.1, adj p-val=0.08), STAT1::STAT2 (MA0517.1, adj p-val=0.15), FOXA1 (MA0148.2, adj p-val=0.24) and FOXD2 (MA0847.2, adj p-val=0.27), compared to epithelial cells with no sign of open chromatin at the ACE2 locus, though the difference is statistically significant (adj p-val <0.05) only for IRF1. Interestingly, Forkhead Box Transcription Factors have been implicated in regulation of ACE2 transcription 94 . Note that because epithelial cells with an accessible ACE2 locus tend to have a higher number of fragments in peaks than cells with inaccessible ACE2 (Extended Data Fig. 11f ), consistent also with higher UMIs in scRNA-seq, some of the cells with inaccessible ACE2 could be false negatives, reducing our power.\n",

      "Previous studies in the healthy lung predicted that interactions between AT2 cells and myeloidlineage macrophages may be important for immune regulation and surfactant homeostasis 95 . To explore this possibility, we predicted interactions between AT2 cells (in general, or ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + dual-positives) and myeloid cells (Methods 96 ), using our large declined donor transplant dataset (\"Regev/Rajagopal\"; 41 samples, 10 patients, 2-6 locations each). AT2 cells and myeloid cells were present in lung lobes samples from all 10 patients, whereas samples from 5 patients contained both ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + dual-positive AT2 cells and myeloid cells. We identified significant predicted interactions involving Oncostatin M (OSM), an IL6-type cytokine expressed by myeloid cells 97 , with the Oncostatin M Receptor (OSMR) and its paralog receptor LIF Receptor Subunit Alpha (LIFR) expressed in both for AT2 cells in general, and in double positive ones). Interactions involving the complement pathway were also predicted (for all AT2 and dual positives) between Complement C3 and C5 expressed by AT2 cells and their cognate receptor expressed in myeloid cells. Three samples had interactions between the IL1 receptor on AT2 cells and IL1B or IL1RN in myeloid cells. The IL1-receptor interactions were identified mostly (in 2 out of 3 samples) involving only dual-positive AT2 cells, suggesting a possible role of ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + dual-positive cells in IL1-mediated processes. Finally, we identified interactions between CSF1, 2, or 3 expressed in AT2 cells (including double positives) and their receptors expressed in myeloid cells. These predicted interactions further support the previously identified roles for cross-talk between AT2 and myeloid cells, such as macrophages, in immune regulation (OSM, complement, IL1) and surfactant homeostasis (CSF), as previously highlighted 95 .\n",

      "We next asked whether human cell types of interest were present in animal models. While such analyses cannot address molecular compatibility (due to sequence variation in ACE2 across species, as shown for lower compatibility of SARS-CoV and mouse ACE2 98 ), they can help determine if dual-positive cells are present in commonly employed models, and if their characteristics, proportions, and programs are similar to those of their human counterparts. In a separate study 46 , our lung network showed strong similarities to the human data in a macaque model. Here, we focused on the more distant, but commonly used, mouse model. Ace2 + Tmprss2 + and Ace2 + Ctsl + dual-positive cells were present primarily in club and multiciliated cells in the airway epithelia of healthy mice 99 (Ace2 + Tmprss2 + club 5.1% [4.7%, 5.4%] and multiciliated 2.8% [2.3%, 3.5%], Ace2 + Ctsl + club 11.1% [10.6%, 11.6%] and multiciliated 3.5% [2.9%, 4.3%]), consistent with the expression patterns found in human airways (Fig. 5a) . Furthermore, Ace2 expression increased over a 2-month time-course of healthy mouse aging in both club (p=1.16e-06) and goblet (p=0.01911) cells (Fig. 5a) . The proportion of Ace2 + Tmprss2 + dual-positive cells did not significantly increase with age during this time course (data not shown), but the proportion of Ace2 + Ctsl + dual-positive cells significantly increased in club cells during this time-course (Fig. 5b) . Interestingly, the mice were aged between 2-4 months, a 2-month period that is reported to reflect the maturation period from early to mature adults 100 . Examining bulk RNA-Seq profiles of sorted populations of alveolar AT2 cells (SFTPC + ), airway basal cells (KRT5 + ), alveolar endothelial cells (CD45-CD31 + ), alveolar epithelial cells (Epcam + ), whole lung and whole trachea from a KRT5-CreER/LSL-TdTomato/SFTPC-eGFP transgenic mouse model, and across tissues from ENCODE, showed that Ace2, Tmprss2 and Ctsl are expressed in sorted AT2 cells, whole trachea and whole lung, as well as in stomach, intestine, kidney and bladder.\n",

      "In human smokers, statistical modeling uncovered a robust trend of increased ACE2 expression in airway epithelial cells, while expression in AT2 cells was reduced (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig.  6 ). To experimentally confirm these findings, we examined cell profiles from mice exposed daily to cigarette smoke for two months, followed by scRNA-seq of whole lungs (Fig. 5c) . Epithelial specific expression patterns of mouse Ace2 and the Ace2 + Tmprss2 + and Ace2 + Ctsl + dual-positive cells were largely consistent with the human data (Fig. 5d) . Upon smoke exposure, there was a significant increase in Ace2 + airway secretory cell numbers, while the fraction of Ace2 + AT2 cells was unaltered (Fig. 5e) . Moreover, the expression levels of Ace2 were significantly increased in airway secretory cells (Fig. 5f ), but not in AT2 cells (Fig. 5g) . This was in agreement with bulk RNA-seq of mouse lungs exposed to different doses of cigarette smoke 101 , in which Ace2 levels increased in a dose-dependent manner by daily cigarette smoke over 5 months (Fig. 5h) . Notably, the COVID-19 relevant proteases Tmprss2 and Ctsl were also significantly increased by smoke exposure in mice (Fig. 5i,j) . Thus, mouse smoking data shows similar trends as observed in humans and experimentally confirms the association of ACE2 levels with smoking.\n",

      "We also compared the patterns between the mouse and human placenta, analyzing Ace2, Tmprss2, and Ctsl expression across 100,000 cells from scRNA-seq data during mouse placenta development from embryonic days 9.5 to 18 (Shu et al., unpublished). We find Ace2 + Tmprss2 + dual-positive cells (1.4%) in a large fraction of fetal trophoblasts with strong epithelial signatures. Ace2 + Tmprss2 + dual-positive cells express signatures of AT2 cells and hepatocytes, and many also express Ctsl. Ace2 + Ctsl + dual-positive cells (3.4%) are also present among fibroblasts, stromal cells, and fetal trophoblasts in both mice and humans (Fig. 5k, Extended Data Fig. 13) . Notably, while ACE2 + CTSL + dual-positive fibroblasts and stromal cells in humans are of maternal origin, Ace2 + Ctsl + dual-positive fibroblasts and stromal cells are of fetal origin in mice.\n",

      "TMPRSS2 has been demonstrated to mediate SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro 37, 44 , but SARS-CoV-2 also infects cells in the absence of TMPRSS2 37 . Thus, additional proteases likely play roles in proteolytic cleavage events of spike and other viral proteins that underlie entry (fusion) and egress. To systematically predict proteases potentially involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we tested for co-expression of each of 625 annotated human protease genes 102 with ACE2 in the large declined donor transplant dataset (\"Regev/Rajagopal\") from 10 patients. The analysis recovered TMPRSS2 as one of the significantly co-expressed in multiple lung epithelial cell types (Fig. 6a , Supplementary Table 11, 12 ). In addition, multiple members of the proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin (PCSK) family were also significantly co-expressed with ACE2 in both proximal and distal airway epithelial cells (Fig. 6a,b) , including FURIN, PCSK2, PCSK5, PCSK6 and PCSK7 in AT2 cells. Proprotein convertases have known roles in coronavirus S-protein priming 43, 103, 104 . We obtained similar results in an independent dataset of 182,952 cells from 40 donors (Extended Data Fig. 14a ,b, \"aggregated lung\").\n",
      "\n",
      "To further investigate the role of proprotein convertases as candidates for SARS-CoV-2 S-protein processing we analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence. Multiple sequence alignment of S-protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and other beta-coronaviruses revealed a polybasic insert at the S1/S2 junction present only in SARS-CoV-2 spike (Extended Data Fig. 14c ). While polybasic sites are found in multiple members of betacoronavirus lineages A and C (e.g., MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 is the only known member of lineage B harboring a polybasic motif in the S1/S2 region (Extended Data Fig. 14c ). As previously reported, this polybasic sequence corresponds well to cleavage motifs of multiple PCSK family proteases (Extended Data Fig. 14d ) [105] [106] [107] , and has a high probability for its PCSK-mediated cleavage (at amino acid 685) (by ProP and PROSPERous 108,109 ) as well as additional sites including the S2' position (at amino acid 815), which would release predicted fusion-mediating peptides (Extended Data Fig. 14e ) 110 .\n",

      "We next examined PCSKs expression and co-expression with ACE2 across lung cell subsets (Fig.  6c, Extended Data Fig. 14f) . FURIN, PCSK5 and PCSK7 were broadly expressed across multiple lung cell types, and PCSK1 and PCSK2 were largely restricted to neuroendocrine cells, as previously reported 107 , with PCSK2 further detected in 11.2% of AT2 cells (Fig. 6d, Extended  Data Fig. 14g ). In many cell subsets we observed dual expression with ACE2 at fractions comparable to or higher than those of ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells (Fig. 6e, Extended Data Fig. 14h ). These include AT2 cells (ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + , ACE2 + FURIN + and ACE2 + PCSK2 + at 0.90%, 0.78%, and 0.56%, Fig. 6e) ; multiciliated cells in the proximal airway (ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + , ACE2 + FURIN + , ACE2 + PCSK7 + , and ACE2 + PCSK5 + at 0.91%, 0.37%, 1.02%, and 0.91%), and basal cells (ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + , ACE2 + FURIN + , and ACE2 + PCSK7 + at 0.19%, 0.21%, and 0.74%). Co-expression is present across tissues in addition to the lung (Extended Data Fig. 14i,j) , including the liver, ileum, kidney and nasal airways, with the highest percentages of ACE2 + PCSK + dual positive cells in nasal airways (ACE2 + PCSK7 + 1.36%, ACE2 + FURIN + 0.67%), bladder (ACE2 + PCSK5 + 0.45%) and testis (ACE2 + PCSK7 + 0.41%).\n",

      "Because different host proteases may contribute to different stages of the viral life cycle 107,111 , we also examined the prevalence of ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + PCSK + triple-positive cells (TPs) in the lung dataset. ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + PCSK7 + were the main triple positive cells in multiciliated (0.75%) and secretory cells (0.72%) of proximal airways, and ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + FURIN + TPs were the most common within AT2 cells (0.36%) (Extended Data Fig. 14k) . Finally, when we examined all known human proteases for co-expression with ACE2 in major lung epithelial cell types (Fig. 6f) , we recovered cathepsins (CTSB, CTSC, CTSD, CTSL, CTSS), proteasome subunits (e.g. PSMB2, PSMB4, PSMB5), and complement proteases (C1R, C2, CFI) (Fig. 6f, Extended Data Fig. 15 ), the latter also captured in our programs above (Fig. 4) .\n",

      "We performed integrative analyses of single-cell atlases in the lung and airways and across tissues to identify cell types and tissues that have the key molecular machinery required for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We then examined the relationship between specific cell types and three key covariates --age, sex, and smoking status --that have been related to disease severity. We further used the scale of these integrated atlases to identify gene programs in major epithelial cell subsets that may be infected by the virus, and search for other potential accessory proteases. Our hope is that this extensive analysis and resource will help with hypothesis generation (and refutation) towards better understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of COVID-19 infection, and the identification of putative therapeutic avenues.\n",

      "Our cross-tissue analysis substantially expands on our 45,46,58,112 and others' 113-115 earlier efforts, allowing us to identify cell subsets across diverse tissues that may be implicated in virus transmission, pathogenesis, or both. Focusing on pathogenesis, in addition to key subsets in the lung, airways and gut, we identified ACE2 + cells that co-express either TMPRSS2 or CTSL in diverse organs, many of which have been associated with severe disease. These include epithelial cells in the liver, kidney, pancreas, and olfactory epithelium, cardiomyocytes, pericytes and fibroblasts in the heart, and oligodendrocytes in the brain. For example, the presence of double positive cardiomyocytes and cardiac pericytes and fibroblasts may provide a pathological basis for the cardiac abnormalities noted in COVID-19 patients including elevated troponin, a signature of cardiomyocyte injury, myocarditis, and sudden cardiac death 5 .

      "One intriguing clinical observation is that some COVID-19 patients display an array of neurologic symptoms 116, 117, 118 , reported as seizures and acute necrotizing encephalopathy, similar to that previously observed following other infections such as influenza 119, 120 . Neuroinflammation could result from direct viral infection of the brain, or a systemic cytokine storm 121-123,124-126,121-123 . Direct viral invasion of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is observed in multiple brain regions in human patients and mouse models 124, 125 , consistent with widespread ACE2 expression in numerous brain cell types. Furthermore, SARS-CoV has been shown to infiltrate the brain via the olfactory epithelium-olfactory bulb axis 127 ; olfactory transmission for SARS-CoV-2 has been recently proposed 128 . Other possible transmission routes could be through the infection of ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + enteric neurons synapsing with vagal afferents, or entry through blood-CNS interfaces such as the choroid plexus or meninges 121,129-131 . Profiling immune cells at these sites after infection is an important future step to better understand how the viral response may lead to encephalitis. One intriguing possibility is that encephalitis might arise as an autoimmune response to myelin antigens expressed by infected cells. Antibodies against peptides of myelin proteins have been clinically shown to be associated with autoimmune encephalitis and seizures [132] [133] [134] , and myelin peptides are targets of T cells 135 in demyelinating inflammatory neurological diseases such as acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, and multiple sclerosis [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] [142] . Oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cells of the CNS, are the main ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cell type in the brain, the myelin transcriptional regulator MYRF was enriched in certain ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cell types as noted above, and myelin proteins MOG and MBP were coexpressed in numerous ACE2+ clusters across organs. MYRF and MBP were significantly differentially expressed in ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + subsets of the lung and gut (Supplementary Table  10 ); myelin targeting Th17 cells trained in the gut are able to infiltrate the CNS in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis 143 . Taken together, the expression of myelin proteins across multiple ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells may hypothetically contribute to antigen presentation and autoimmune response in the context of viral infection. A small number of COVID-19 patients were reported to have Guillain-Barre Syndrome 144 , with a demyelinating process in some; this is consistent with observations of Guillain-Barre Syndrome following other viral infections such as Zika, influenza, and Epstein-Barr virus 139, 145, 146 . Whether anti myelin specific immunity can be induced by virus infected cells expressing myelin proteins remains an area for future study.\n",

      "Our meta--analysis of scRNA-seq across studies provided the required statistical power to uncover population-level signals at a molecular level and at single-cell resolution. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and associated proteases were up-regulated in airway epithelial and AT2 cells with age and in males, an association that may shed light on the marked increase in mortality with age. Furthermore, ACE2 was up-regulated in airway epithelial cells (basal and multiciliated cells) in past or present smokers, but down-regulated in their AT2 cells; we have also confirmed this in an experimental system in a mouse model. These contrasting smoking associations show the importance of the single-cell resolution, as the down-regulation in AT2 cells will be masked by . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Importantly, ACE2 is particularly lowly expressed in young pediatric samples, also mirrored by lack of chromatin accessibility in the ACE2 locus. ACE2 expression is known to be regulated in complex ways across different tissues and may be affected by both common therapies (ACEi/ARB) (Tucker et al., companion manuscript 58 ), and during infection 46 . Moreover, both higher ACE2 expression per cell and a higher fraction of ACE2 + cells can in principle have implications for infection, but may have conflicting effects on pathogenesis, as ACE2 knockout mice show more severe ARDS upon lung injury because of its role in the renin-angiotensin pathway, which seems to protect from consequences of lung injury and inflammation 148 (for potential roles of this pathway on CoV infection (pre-COVID) see the review in 149 ). As SARS-CoV2 binding will lead to internalization and therefore downregulation of ACE2 on the cell surface, the protective function of ACE2 via its proteolytic processing of Angiotensin-II may be lost. Thus, the smoking mediated downregulation of ACE2 in AT2 cells may not protect cells from being infected but rather may increase ARDS due to more severe loss of ACE2 from the cell surface upon infection. Other confounders, including ACEi which are not available to our meta-analysis may further impact our results.\n",

      "To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first single-cell meta-analysis (in any setting). To perform this meta-analysis, we used a model that included both the tested covariates (age, sex, and smoking status), technical covariates (dataset and the number of UMIs per cell), and several interaction terms. Including these interaction terms was crucial, as omission resulted in increased background variation and reversed effect estimates. Likewise, modeling the smoking status of a donor was important to reduce background variation and account for the unbalanced distribution of covariates in the dataset. For example, while we have similar numbers of male ascertained smokers and non-smokers (21 and 20 donors), there are three times as many female ascertained non-smokers as female smokers (27 and 9 donors), which is reflective of this bias in the population 150 . The addition of these terms increases the complexity of the model. Indeed, only one dataset (\"Seibold\") had sufficient numbers of donors of various ages, sex, and smoking status to fit the full model. Thus, performing the meta-analysis was only possible due to the aggregation of a large number of healthy single-cell datasets enabled by the HCA Lung Biological Network and a community-wide effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "A limitation of our expression model is that each cell is treated as an independent observation. Thus, the significance of association with traits such as sex, age, and smoking status may show inflated p-values, especially where the associations are determined from few donors. In this case, the variation between cells from a single donor dominates the variation between donors, background variation is underestimated and effect significance can be overestimated. Aggregating many datasets allows us to counteract this effect, yet p-value inflation may occur in cell types that are not as commonly shared across datasets. Our main conclusions are drawn on airway epithelial and AT2 cells, which are distributed widely across datasets and are modeled on the basis of many donors. Furthermore, we have confirmed significant associations by pseudo-bulk analysis and by holding out datasets. This confirmation ensures that associations are consistent when only considering donor variation, and we are aware if these associations are dataset dependent (often when one dataset is a particularly major source of a given cell type). Models that account for both single-cell count distributions, and population structure in the data have the potential to improve future meta-analyses across single-cell atlases.\n",

      "Having a cell type annotation with consistent resolution across datasets was instrumental for analyzing the association with clinical covariates up to the resolution of basal, secretory, or multiciliated cells. These cell type labels still aggregate over considerable diversity, which is the subject of ongoing scientific research. Importantly, the labeled subtypes of these cell clusters differ between datasets. Thus, in those cases where individual associations depend on a particular dataset not being held out, it may be the case that these associations become more robust at a higher level of cell type annotation. Future high-resolution cell annotation efforts have the potential to further consolidate our single-cell meta-analysis results.\n",

      "In addition to modeling associations between gene expression and clinical co-variates, we also examined whether the proportion of ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells per sample is associated with age or sex. While we can observe a trend of double positive cell proportions increasing with age (Extended Data Fig. 3a) , the high compositional diversity across samples and studies (Fig. 3a,  Extended Data Fig. 16 ), the potential confounders (total counts, dataset), and limited sample numbers are prohibitive to modeling these associations. Further metadata that describe the sample diversity such as harmonized annotations on anatomical location, sampling methods, and sample processing can help to capture this heterogeneity in ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cell proportion models.\n",

      "The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in lung, nasal and gut epithelial cells is associated with expression programs with many shared features, involving key immunological genes and genes related to viral infection, raising many hypotheses for future studies, especially as more patient tissue samples are analyzed in the coming months. In the lung, epithelial cells express IL6, IL6R and IL6ST, which raises the hypothesis that infection may trigger cytokine expression from these cells and contribute to uncontrolled immunological responses. The immune-like programs in these cells are further reinforced by the accessibility of STAT and IRF binding sites in scATAC-Seq data, consistent with another study from our network showing the role of interferon in regulating ACE2 expression in epithelial cells 46 . Notably, scRNA-Seq analysis of immune cells from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of COVID-19 patients identified high activity of transcription factors such as STAT1/2 and IRF1/2/5/7/8/9 in macrophage states increased in severe COVID-19 patients 151 . Other hypotheses for future studies include lysosomal genes in dual positive lung secretory and multiciliated cells, which may be consistent with putative \"viral entry\" cells, and RIPK3 expression in the cell programs of airway cells, which opens the hypothesis of necroptosis initiating a pro-inflammatory response. Interestingly, we observed relatively high enrichment of ACE2 in secretory cell types (mucous cells and AT2 cells). We speculate that viruses may take advantage of the rich secretory pathway components in these cells for their efficient dispersal. Additionally, SMGs of the airways are recently shown to serve as reservoirs of reserve stem cells 152, 153 . Therefore, we also speculate that SMGs similarly may serve as reservoirs for viruses where they can escape from muco-ciliary transport and mechanical expulsion associated with severe cough in the airway luminal surface.\n",

      "The gene programs of AT2 cells can also contribute to cross talk with alveolar macrophages. Our cell-cell interaction analysis suggests that AT2 cells engage with alveolar macrophages through Oncostatin M, CSF, IL1 and complement pathways, suggesting therapeutic hypotheses.

Moreover, excessive complement activation resulting in acute lung injury and cytokine storms were also implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS 156 , and complement inhibition using the anti-C5 antibody eculizumab 157 is currently evaluated as anti-inflammatory experimental emergency treatment for severe COVID-19 in clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04288713). In our analysis, multiple complement pathway proteases (e.g. C1R, C2, CFI) are co-expressed with ACE2 across different lung cell subsets (Fig. 6f,g, Extended Data Fig. 15 ) and complement inhibitory factor CD55 and complement protease C3 were preferentially expressed by ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + DPs within lung tissue, in multiciliated and secretory cells, respectively (Fig.  4a,c, Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Tables 7,8) . Moreover, cell-cell interaction analysis predicted cross-talk between AT2 cells expressing complement proteins C3 and C5 and macrophages expressing cognate receptors. AT2 cell expression of negative complement regulators CFI and CD55 might represent a strategy for SARS-CoV-2 to at least partially escape complement surveillance.\n",

      "Finally, to explore therapeutic hypotheses related to disruption of viral processing via protease inhibition, we explored the expression of other proteases across our integrated atlases. Although a multitude of different SARS-CoV-2 features likely account for its high pathogenicity and transmissivity, it has been speculated that the PRRAR loop might contribute to increased COVID-19 severity. Introduction of similar polybasic cleavage sites into avian influenza viruses and human coronaviruses was shown to render them more pathogenic, increasing mortality and viral spread 158, 159 . One hypothesis is that acquisition of a PCSK cleavage site would expand the number of cell types that can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2. A recent report has started to address expression of FURIN in cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 host factors ACE2 or TMPRSS2 47 , and FURIN activity is inhibited by Guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs), a group of interferonstimulated genes, in order to restrict viral envelope processing 160 . However, the highly overlapping recognition sequence of PCSK family members (Extended Data Fig. 14d) suggests that multiple PCSKs in addition to FURIN could mediate cleavage at the S1/S2 PRRAR motif (Extended Data  Fig. 14e) . Our expression analysis confirms that PCSK family members, in particular FURIN, PCSK5 and PCSK7, are more broadly expressed than TMPRSS2 across lung cell types (Fig. 6d) , as well as across tissues (Extended Data Fig. 14i) . In the lung, we note the higher proportion of ACE2 + PCSK7 + basal cells and ACE2 + PCSK7/5 + fibroblasts (Fig. 6e, Extended Data Fig. 14h) . Interestingly, the host interactome of SARS-CoV-2 further suggests interaction of viral proteins with PCSK6 89 , which also showed significant ACE2 co-expression in AT2 cells (Fig. 6b,  Extended Data Fig. 14b) . Moreover, because PCSK localization is detected in different membrane compartments along the secretory and endocytic pathways 107 , it is conceivable that PCSKs could process SARS-CoV-2 S-proteins at different stages of the viral life cycle. Moreover, further analysis is required to assess the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 relies on proteolytic activity provided in trans either by neighboring cells or extracellularly localized proteases 111 . Altogether, this could provide SARS-CoV-2 with an immense flexibility in different entry and egress pathways.\n",

These terms model whether there is a difference in the smoking effect in men and women, and likewise whether the age effect is different for smokers and non-smokers. While we model these interaction terms, we only tested age, sex, and smoking effects individually to reduce the multiple testing burden. We included the dataset term to model the batch effects between the diverse datasets we obtained, and the log total counts per cell was used as an offset. Here, the total counts were scaled to have a mean of 1 across all cells before the log was taken. In order to fit this model we pruned the data to contain only datasets that have at least 2 donors and for which smoking status metadata was provided. This resulted in a dataset of 761,693 cells and 165 samples from 77 donors for adult lung data. Only a single dataset remained for adult nasal data after this filtering on which the model could not be fit.

As donor variation tends to be larger than single-cell variation, when most cells come from few donors (either there are few donors, or few donors contribute most of the cells), this can lead to an inflation of p-values. To counteract this effect, we verified that significant associations are consistent when modeling only donor variation via pseudo-bulk analysis, and we tested whether effects are dependent on few donors by holding out datasets.\n",

After filtering as described above, models (2) and (3) were fit to the data. In contrast to the single-cell model, pseudo-bulk analysis underestimates certainty in modeled effects as uncertainty in the pseudo-bulk means are not taken into account. Thus, we used only effect directions from pseudo-bulk analysis to validate singlecell associations. We regarded only those associations as significant, where the FDR-corrected pvalue in the single-cell model is below 0.05, and the sign of the estimated effect is consistent in both the single-cell and the pseudo-bulk analysis.\n",

Within each tissue, we identified cell types with greater than 10 DPs, and for each of these cell types, we selected the genes with increased expression (log fold change greater than 0) in DPs vs DNs (so that we focus on important \"positive\" features). We trained a classifier with 75:25 train:test split to classify the DPs from DNs within each of these cell types using the sklearn (version 0.21.3) 175 RandomForestClassifier function with the following parameters: n_estimators set to 100, the criterion as gini, and the class_weight parameter set to balanced_subsample.

To fit this model, we subsampled cells from DP and DN groups to ensure that both the donor distribution and the cell complexity (i.e. the number of genes per cell) were evenly matched between the two groups, as follows. First, for each subset, we restricted our analysis to donors containing at least two DN and two DP cells. Using these samples, we partitioned the cells into 10 equally-sized bins based on cell complexity and subsampled DN cells from each bin to match the cell complexity distribution of the DP cells.

      "Title : Cigarette smoke triggers the expansion of a subpopulation of respiratory epithelial cells that express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2\n",
      "In December 2019, a novel respiratory disease emerged in a seafood market in Wuhan, China 1 . Genomic sequencing demonstrated that the causative agent was a highly-contagious coronavirus, since named SARS-CoV-2 2,3 . The disease, called COVID-19, rapidly spread worldwide, and as of March 2020, more than 600,000 people have been infected and more than 25,000 people have died 4 . No clinically-validated treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 is currently available. Thus, understanding the factors that mediate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for controlling disease transmission. Molecular analysis has begun to shed light on how SARS-CoV-2 infections occur. Like a related coronavirus that emerged in 2003 5 , SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by binding to the extracellular domain of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) 3,6 . Importantly, ACE2 is both necessary and sufficient for infection by SARS-CoV-2: ACE2-targeting antibodies block viral uptake in permissive cells while transgenic expression of human ACE2 allows viral entry in nonhuman cells. ACE2 normally functions in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by cleaving the vasoconstrictive hormone angiotensin-II into the vasodilator angiotensin 1-7 7 . Sequestration of ACE2 by coronavirus dysregulates the RAS pathway, contributing to morbidity 8 . Additionally, ACE2 levels are capable of influencing disease progression: among a cohort of mice engineered to express human ACE2, mice expressing the highest levels of ACE2 mRNA exhibited the shortest survival time following coronavirus exposure 9 . Thus, the regulation of ACE2 expression likely has a significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Epidemiological studies have identified several demographic features that correlate with the severity of clinical COVID-19 cases. While fewer than 5% of SARS-CoV-2 infections are fatal 10 , men and elderly patients are particularly at risk of developing severe disease 11-14 . Additionally, cigarette smokers are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and are significantly more likely to require aggressive clinical interventions: in a study of 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, 12.3% of current smokers required mechanical ventilation, were admitted to an ICU, or died, compared to only 4.7% of non-smokers 12 . The causes underlying these differences in clinical outcome are at present unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to study factors that could potentially influence susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we investigated the expression of the coronavirus receptor ACE2. We first assessed the expression of ACE2 in a variety of post-mortem rodent and human tissues ( Figure S1 and Table  S1 ) 15-18 . ACE2 was consistently expressed at high levels in mouse, rat, and human kidneys, consistent with its role as a regulator of the RAS pathway. ACE2 was also robustly expressed in rodent and human lungs, the predominant location of coronavirus infections. Interestingly, significant ACE2 expression was evident in the mouse and human small intestine. Viral RNA has been detected in stool samples from patients with COVID-19 19 , and gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in a subset of affected individuals 12 , suggesting a potential alternate route for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, as SARS-CoV-2 is primarily spread through viral inhalation, we focused our study on factors that affect ACE2 expression in the lung and associated respiratory tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Age and male sex are significant risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infections. We therefore investigated whether either feature was associated with increased ACE2 expression. Young mice (<26 weeks) and elderly mice (>78 weeks) displayed equivalent levels of ACE2 expression in the lung, as did young rats (6 weeks) and elderly rats (104 weeks)( Figure 1A-B) 17, 20 . Similarly, ACE2 expression in rodent lungs was not significantly different between sexes ( Figure 1C -D) 17,21 . We next assessed the expression of ACE2 in two different human cohorts: 1) lung tissue from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) 15, 16 and 2) whole-lung tissue samples from organ donors 22 . These datasets yielded results that were consistent with our rodent analyses: ACE2 expression was equivalent between men and women and between young individuals (<29 years) and elderly individuals (>70 years)( Figure 1E -H). In total, these findings suggest that the increased morbidity of men and older patients with COVID-19 is unlikely to result from inherent differences in ACE2 expression in the respiratory tract.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cigarette smoking is strongly associated with adverse outcomes from COVID-19 12,23 . To investigate whether smoking could affect ACE2 levels, we first assessed gene expression in mouse lungs. We analyzed a cohort of mice exposed to diluted cigarette smoke for 2, 3, or 4 hours per day for five months 24 . Strikingly, we found a dose-dependent increase in ACE2 expression according to smoke exposure ( Figure 2A ). Mice exposed to the highest dose of cigarette smoke expressed ~80% more ACE2 in their lungs compared to sham-treated mice. To determine whether this association was present in humans as well, we assessed three cohorts of current smokers and never-smokers 25-27 . For these analyses, lung epithelial cells were sampled from either the small or large airways by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. In each cohort, we observed that tissue collected from smokers exhibited ~40%-50% more ACE2 compared to tissue from nonsmokers ( Figure 2B -D).\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we sought to determine whether human ACE2 expression showed a dose-dependent relationship with cigarette smoke, as we had observed in mice. To investigate this, we analyzed two human datasets: 1) lung tissue from a cohort of smokers undergoing thoracic surgery for transplantation, lung volume reduction, or nodule resection 28 and 2) lung tissue from a cohort of patients analyzed as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 29 . For patients undergoing cancer-related surgeries, a sample of pathologically-normal tissue distant from the suspected tumor was used for analysis. In both cohorts, lung samples from patients who reported smoking the greatest number of pack-years also expressed the highest levels of ACE2 ( Figure 2E -F). For instance, among smokers undergoing thoracic surgery, patients who had smoked more than 80 pack-years exhibited a ~100% increase in ACE2 expression relative to patients who had smoked less than 20 pack-years ( Figure 2E ). Multivariate linear regression on this dataset further confirmed that smoking history was a significant predictor of ACE2 expression even when controlling for a patient's age, sex, race, and body-mass index (Table 1) . Lastly, we compared the expression level of ACE2 in lung epithelial cells from current smokers and former smokers 30 , and we found that quitting smoking was associated with a 30% decrease in ACE2 expression ( Figure 2F ). In total, our results demonstrate that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the expression of the coronavirus receptor ACE2 in rodent and human respiratory tissue, and this upregulation is potentially reversible.\n",
      "\n",
      "To follow up on these observations, we considered the possibility that ACE2 expression was commonly upregulated by lung diseases and/or carcinogen exposure. Indeed, we observed increased ACE2 expression in two cohorts of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) 31,32 , a lung disease strongly associated with prior cigarette exposure ( Figure S2A -B) 33 . However, ACE2 was not up-regulated in lung cells from a large cohort of patients with asthma or from patients with the lung disease sarcoidosis ( Figure S2C-D) 34, 35 . Similarly, ACE2 expression was unaffected in lung tissue from a mouse model of cystic fibrosis or in mice exposed to a variety of carcinogens, including arsenic, ionizing radiation (IR), and 1,3-butadiene ( Figure S2E -G) 36-39 . We conclude that ACE2 upregulation in the lung is tightly associated with a history of cigarette smoking and is not a universal response to pathological insults.\n",

      "Coronavirus infections are facilitated by a set of host proteases that cleave and activate the viral spike (S) protein 40 . SARS-CoV-2 primarily relies on the serine protease TMPRSS2 but can also utilize an alternate pathway involving Cathepsin B/L in TMPRSS2-negative cells 6 . Interestingly, we observed that Cathepsin B expression, but not TMPRSS2 or Cathepsin L expression, was consistently increased in mice and humans exposed to cigarette smoke ( Figure S3 ). Thus, smoking can upregulate both the coronavirus receptor as well as a protease that SARS-CoV-2 uses for viral activation.\n",

      "Mammalian lungs harbor more than 30 distinct cell types representing a variety of epithelial, endothelial, stromal, and immune compartments 41 . Of note, the upper respiratory epithelium is comprised of mucociliary cells, including goblet cells, club cells, and ciliated cells, that secrete protective fluids and remove inhaled particles from the airways 42 . The lower respiratory epithelium includes alveolar type 1 cells, which allow gas exchange with the blood, and alveolar type 2 cells, which regulate alveolar fluid balance and can differentiate into type 1 cells following injury 43 .\n",
      "\n",
      "To gain further insight into coronavirus infections, we profiled multiple single-cell RNA-Seq experiments to identify the cell type(s) that express ACE2. We first examined a dataset containing 13,822 cells from normal mouse lungs 44 . We performed unsupervised Leiden clustering to separate the cells into distinct populations and then we assigned cell types to major clusters using established markers 45-48 . ACE2 was expressed solely in the EpCAM+ clusters that comprise the lung epithelium 49 , and was not detected in CD45+ immune cells 50 , PDGFRA+ mesenchymal cells 51 , or TMEM100+ endothelial cells ( Figure 3A ) 52 . We therefore focused on localizing ACE2 within the epithelial lineage. We found that ACE2 was strongly expressed in a cluster of cells that express secretory markers including MUC5AC, GABRP, and SCGB1A1 that we identified as being comprised of closely-related goblet and club cells ( Figure 3B -C) 48,53-55 . Additionally, ACE2 expression was observed in a subset of LAMP3+ alveolar type 2 cells 56 , but was largely absent from RTKN2+ alveolar type 1 cells 48 and FOXJ1+ ciliated cells 57 . We next identified the transcripts whose expression correlated with ACE2. Across all cells, ACE2 levels exhibited the strongest correlation with CLDN10 (Claudin-10), a tight-junction protein that contributes to the formation of the bronchial epithelium and that is expressed by club cells and goblet cells ( Figure 3C ) 58,59 . Gene ontology analysis revealed that ACE2-correlated transcripts were enriched for genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, antioxidant activity, and cellular detoxification, consistent with the bronchial epithelium's role as a barrier against toxins and foreign matter ( Figure 3D and Table S2A ) 60 .\n",
      "\n",
      "To confirm our findings regarding ACE2's localization, we subsequently repeated this analysis on an independent lung single-cell dataset ( Figure S4 ). Consistent with our initial observations, we found that ACE2+ cells localized to clusters of epithelial cells that expressed the goblet and club cell markers CLDN10, GABRP, and SCGB1A1 or the alveolar type 2 marker LAMP3 ( Figure S4A -C). Gene ontology analysis on ACE2-correlated transcripts revealed a similar enrichment for xenobiotic metabolism and cellular detoxification ( Figure S4D and Table S2B ). In total, our combined analysis demonstrates that ACE2 is expressed in secretory club and goblet cells as well as alveolar type 2 cells within the lung epithelium.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our findings suggested a possible explanation for the upregulation of ACE2 in the lungs of cigarette smokers. Chronic exposure to cigarette smoke has been reported to trigger the expansion of secretory goblet cells, which produce mucous to protect the respiratory epithelium from inhaled irritants 61-63 . Thus, the increased expression of ACE2 in smokers' lungs could be a byproduct of smoking-induced secretory cell hyperplasia. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined a dataset of single-cell transcriptomes collected by fiberoptic bronchoscopy from current smokers and never-smokers 59 . Notably, these cells were sorted and enriched for an epithelial cell marker (ALCAM) prior to sequencing. Additionally, they were collected from the main stem bronchus, and subsequently harbor few RTKN2+ or LAMP3+ alveolar cells 59 . This population was therefore highly enriched for upper-respiratory epithelial cells, and allowed us to localize ACE2 within this population with increased precision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using this purified dataset, we could more easily differentiate between goblet cells (marked by MUC5AC) 53 , club cells (marked by SCGB1A1) 54 , ciliated cells (marked by FOXJ1) 57 , ionocytes (marked by CFTR) 64 , and basal cells (which serve as respiratory epithelial stem cells and are marked by KRT5) 65 . We found that ACE2 expression was observed in both MUC5AC+ goblet cells and SCGB1A1+ club cells, but was largely absent from the basal cell, ciliated cell, and ionocyte clusters ( Figure 4A -B). Next, we separated the cells harvested from current smokers and never-smokers and then analyzed each population separately. Consistent with previous reports 61-63 , we detected an increase in goblet cells in the lungs of current smokers: while 17% of cells from non-smokers expressed the canonical goblet marker MUC5AC 53 , 47% of cells collected from smokers were positive for MUC5AC ( Figure 4C -D). Cells that expressed other mucus-and goblet cell-related genes, including MUC1 67 , AGR2 68 , and SPDEF 69 , were similarly over-represented in the lungs of smokers. KRT5+ basal stem cells were depleted in the smokers' epithelia, likely reflecting their differentiation into secretory cells ( Figure 4C ). However, we note that in this dataset, we observed an increase in the percentage of ACE2+ cells between non-smokers and smokers that was not statistically-significant. This may reflect the small number of cells that were analyzed (~1,000) or the small number of smokers that were profiled (six).\n",
      "\n",
      "Secretory cell differentiation of lung epithelium can be modeled in vitro by culturing cells at an airliquid interface (ALI) 70, 71 . Under appropriate conditions, primary respiratory cells growing at an ALI will undergo mucociliary differentiation into a stratified epithelium consisting of ciliated cells, goblet cells, and club cells 72 . As our single-cell analysis suggested that the coronavirus receptor ACE2 is expressed in secretory goblet and club cells, we investigated whether in vitro mucociliary differentiation increases ACE2 expression. Indeed, in mouse tracheal extracts 73 and primary human lung cells 74 , mucociliary differentiation resulted in a highly-significant upregulation of ACE2 ( Figure 4E -F). Finally, to investigate the link between smoking, differentiation, and ACE2 expression, we examined data from human bronchial epithelial cells cultured at an ALI in which cells were either exposed to clean air or to diluted cigarette smoke 75 . Remarkably, treatment with cigarette smoke during in vitro differentiation resulted in a significant upregulation of ACE2, MUC5AC, MUC1, and other secretory cell markers, relative to cells that were differentiated in clean air ( Figure 4G ). ACE2 expression was increased by ~42% in smoke-exposed cells, comparable to the increases that we observed between the lungs of non-smokers and smokers ( Figure 2 ). In total, our results demonstrate that a subset of lung secretory cells express the coronavirus receptor ACE2, and cigarette smoke promotes the expansion of this cell population.\n",

      "the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 in their lungs. This upregulation is likely mediated at least in part by the expansion of ACE2+ mucus-secreting goblet cells triggered by chronic smoke exposure. The overabundance of ACE2 in the lungs of smokers may partially explain why smokers are significantly more likely to develop severe SARS-CoV-2 infections that require aggressive medical interventions 12,23 . Furthermore, as quitting smoking is associated with a decrease in ACE2 expression, we speculate that giving up cigarettes may reduce susceptibility to COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several contrasting findings exist in the literature on ACE2 and cigarette exposure [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] . In particular, it has been reported that nicotine and/or cigarette smoke has the potential to downregulate ACE2 expression in certain tissues or cell types [76] [77] [78] [79] . In this manuscript, we focused our analysis on factors affecting ACE2 expression in the mammalian lungs and associated respiratory epithelia. We observed a consistent correlation between smoking history and ACE2 expression that was dose-dependent ( Figure 2E -F), that could be recapitulated in mice ( Figure  2A ) and in vitro ( Figure 4G ), and that remained significant when controlling for other demographic variables (Table 1) . Thus, we propose that cigarette smoke causes an upregulation of ACE2 expression in the respiratory tract, though we recognize that smoking may have different effects on ACE2 levels in the heart, kidney, or other organs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our results concerning the localization of ACE2 agree with and expand on several unpublished reports [82] [83] [84] . Consistent with our findings, these analyses identified a population of ACE2+ cells in the alveolar type 2 compartment. However, as these previous reports predominantly analyzed tissue from the lower respiratory tract, we speculate that they were enriched for alveolar cells relative to cells from the upper respiratory epithelium. By analyzing datasets from both mice and humans, and by including cells collected from bronchial brushing, we also demonstrate the presence of ACE2 in the secretory cells that participate in mucociliary clearance 42 . As these cells line the upper respiratory tract, they may represent the initial site of coronavirus infections, followed by an eventual spread and migration into the alveoli. Moreover, secretory cell hyperplasia is a well-described consequence of prolonged smoke exposure 61-63 , potentially explaining the consistent up-regulation of ACE2 in smokers' lungs. Interestingly, ACE2-knockout mice have been reported to be particularly vulnerable to lung failure following forced acid inhalation 85 . Thus, the ACE2 that we uncovered in mucociliary cells could potentially play a direct role in protecting the airways from inhaled toxins and foreign matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The factors that mediate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infections are poorly understood. We speculate that the increased expression of ACE2 in the lungs of smokers could partially contribute to the severe cases of COVID-19 that have been observed in this population. In support of this hypothesis, mice that were engineered to express high levels of human ACE2 succumbed to infections with a related coronavirus more quickly than mice that expressed low levels of human ACE2 9 . Nonetheless, the relevance of increased ACE2 expression as a driver of disease susceptibility in humans or for SARS-CoV-2 remains to be demonstrated. Chronic smokers may exhibit a number of co-morbidities, including emphysema, atherosclerosis, and decreased immune function 86 , that are also likely to affect COVID-19 progression. While the effects of smoking can last for years, smoking cessation causes an improvement in lung function and an overall decrease in disease burden 86 . Interestingly, quitting smoking also leads to a normalization of respiratory epithelial architecture 87 , a decrease in hyperplasia 88 , and a downregulation of ACE2 levels. Thus, for multiple reasons, smoking cessation could eventually lessen the risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n",

      "Title : Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics identify tobacco-use disparity in lung gene expression of ACE2, the receptor of 2019-nCov\n",
      "In the past two decades, pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs) have caused epidemic infections, including the server acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV outbreak in 2003, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012 and the current Wuhan 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) outbreak. They typically affect the respiratory tract and cause severe respiratory illnesses. We have learned from SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov that human populations showed disparities in susceptibility to these viruses. For example, epidemiology studies found that males had higher incidence and mortality rates than females. 1, 2 We believe that the susceptibility to the novel 2019-nCov is also different among population groups. In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, Xu et.al. computationally modelled protein interactions and identified a putative cell entry receptor of 2019-nCov, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is also a receptor for SARS-nCov. 3 Zhou et.al. further confirmed this virus receptor in the HELA cell line. 4 Interestingly, Zhao et al. found ACE2 is specifically expressed in a subset of type II alveolar cells (AT2), in which genes regulating viral reproduction and transmission are highly expressed. 5 They also found that an Asian male had much higher ratio of ACE2-expressing cell than other seven white and African American donors, which may indicate the higher susceptibility of Asian. However, the sample size was too small to draw conclusion on this racial disparity. Here, we analyzed four large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression. Also, we analyzed two lung tissue single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the distribution of ACE2 gene expression among cell types, which will provide new knowledge for understanding the mechanism and population disparities of 2019-nCov infection.\n",

The difference is not significant (p-value=0.18), which may be due to the small sample size of this study (n=33) with insufficient power to detect the difference. The GSE19804 data which has only non-smoker samples available was not included into the analysis. Adjusted by other factors (age, gender, race and platforms) in multivariate analysis, smoking still shows a significant disparity in ACE2 gene expression (p-value=0.01, Fig. 1B) . These data were from the normal lung tissue of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, which may be different with the lung tissue of healthy people. Therefore, we also analyzed a gene expression dataset of airway epithelium from healthy smokers and healthy non-smokers. Consistently, we observed a significant upregulation of ACE2 gene expression in both large airway epithelium and small airway epithelium of smokers (p-value=4.99E-4 and 7.02E-3, respectively, Fig. 2C ). Furthermore, we investigated ordinal categorized smoking history (non-smoker, former smoker quit more than 15yrs, former smoker quit less than15yrs, and current smoker) and showed results in Figure 2B . In the TCGA dataset, we found a significant trend of ACE2 gene expression regulation associated with the smoking history that current smokers had the highest expression, non-smokers had the lowest expression and former smokers had that inbetween (ordinal regression p-value=0.01, Fig. 2B ). We found a similar but non-significant trend in the GSE10072 due to its small size (ordinal regression p-value=0.11). We didn't observe such a tread in the TCGA dataset. Instead, we found a higher average expression in recent quitters (<=15 years) compared to non-smokers, current smokers and former .

We also identified a smoking related basal cell subpopulation which might be pro-goblet precursor cells and has been discussed in the study of Duclos G et.al. 14 Interestingly, we found ACE2 is mainly expressed in goblet cells in current smokers and club cells in non-smokers (Fig. 3B) , indicating 2019-nCov may infect different cell types in bronchial epithelium of current smokers and non-smokers.\n",

It also consistent with the epidemiology study of 24,554 cases that former smokers (49%) have the higher risk to develop severe disease than non-smokers (14.5%) and current smokers (21.7%) 19 . We didn't observe significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female).

      "Cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are rapidly increasing globally. As of April 5, 2020, more than 1.2 million cases have been confirmed and ~70,000 deaths have been reported in ~180 countries. 1 Several studies have rapidly provided crucial data (e.g., incubation period) related to various aspects of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 : severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection. 2 However, risk factors for the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 are poorly understood. Such information is critical to identify high risk patients and to facilitate planning (e.g., forecasting the need for hospital beds and mechanical ventilators). These risk factors will also have implications for workforce allocation (e.g., assignment of healthcare providers with specific risk factors to positions with reduced risk of exposure to .\n",
      "\n",
      "To date, several studies have reported that a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and traditional CVD risk factors, e.g., age, male sex, current smoking, hypertension, and diabetes, are associated with severe COVID-19. However, other than age, results have been inconsistent. Furthermore, few studies accounted for potential confounding by age and sex when they evaluated other potential risk factors. For example, some studies reported that hypertension is a risk factor of severe COVID-19, but their observations may simply reflect the fact that hypertension is more common in older adults. 3 Nonetheless, despite the lack of robust evidence, this observation, together with the fact SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as an entry to human body, 4 has raised a concern about continued use of reninangiotensin system increase among some clinicians and researchers. 5, 6 In this context, we conducted a systematic review of studies reporting cardiovascular risk factors and their relation to severe manifestation of COVID-19 (i.e., death, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] , the need of mechanical ventilator support, and admission to an intensive care unit [ICU]), with a particular interest on studies that adjusted for key confounders such as age and sex.\n",

A few studies demonstrated positive associations of current smoking with severe COVID-19. Several studies reported that pre-existing CVD, hypertension, and diabetes were also associated with severe COVID-19. However, only two studies that reported estimates for these comorbidities adjusted for age and/or sex. One study found that the association between coronary heart disease and severe COVID-19 was no longer statistically significant after age adjustment, 25 whereas the other showed independent associations of hypertension and diabetes with severe COVID-19 in analyses that adjusted for age and a few other comorbidities. 17 Although the primary estimate was not statistically significant, our metaregression analyses indicated some degree of confounding by age, but not necessarily by sex, for the associations of hypertension, diabetes, and prior CVD with severe COVID-19.\n",

      "The positive association of sociodemographic factors (age, male sex, and smoking) with severe COVID-19 is consistent with reports of other infectious diseases (e.g., influenza virus and SARS in 2003). [27] [28] [29] There are several plausible mechanisms. Older age is linked to reduced immune reaction, more comorbidities, and limited organ reserve. 3, 27, 30 Male sex is related to higher prevalence of comorbidities, less frequency of washing hands, and immunological disadvantage given X-chromosome coding proteins in the immune system, 2,31,32 whereas smoking can damage respiratory system. 33 In our meta-analysis, we confirmed overall positive crude associations of CVD, hypertension, and diabetes with severe COVID-19, with pooled relative risk estimates around 3-.

An important question is whether these associations are independent of major confounders, particularly age. Although we could not obtain a definite answer as very few studies ran multivariable models, our meta-regression analysis indicated some degree of confounding by age. One study by Zhou et al showed substantial attenuation of the association between coronary heart disease and severe COVID-19. On the other hand, Liang et al showed independent associations of hypertension and diabetes with severe COVID-19 in a relatively large sample size of 1,590 patients. These is also biologic plausibility. Hypertension and diabetes are leading risk factors for CVD and kidney diseases, and there is evidence that COVID-19 damages these organs. 34, 35 Available studies provide scant evidence related to the hypothesized adverse effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors on severity of COVID-19 infection. As noted above, there is biological plausibility for potential associations of COVID-19 with hypertension and diabetes, two comorbidities associated with use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. Only one study reported the prevalence of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors use. 13 In this study, ~30% of patients reported prevalent hypertension, but only ~5% of patients were taking renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. 13 Thus, it is reasonable that many expert organizations recommend continuing this category of medications until better evidence becomes available. 4 Our results can potentially be used to guide decision-making. While the lack of discrete age thresholds for severe COVID-19 complicates this process, data on case fatality rates from three countries (Web Table 2 ) suggest that age older than 60 or 65 years confers high risk of severe COVID-19 (relative risk > ~5 compared to <50 years). Our results also indicate male sex is an independent risk factor with a pooled relative risk of ~1.7. Although it is very likely that the pooled crude relative risk of ~3-3.5 for hypertension, diabetes, and CVD overestimate their impact beyond age and sex, all or some of them may each confer 1.5-2 times greater risk. Thus, using these factors, it is possible to estimate, at least crudely, the risk of severe COVID-19. For example, a man aged 60-65 years old, with either hypertension, diabetes, or prior CVD would .

Such information could be used to inform decisions on testing for COVID-19, clinical management of COVID-19, and workforce planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our study has some limitations. First, reflecting the fact that the outbreak started from China, most studies were from China. However, given similar case-fatality rates and clinical manifestations across different countries, it seems likely that these results are largely generalizable. Nonetheless, we need to acknowledge regional variations of some risk factors (e.g., ~25-fold difference in the prevalence of smoking in men vs. women in China 36 ) and thus future investigations in different regions would be valuable. Second, we did not include non-English publications. Third, most studies reported odds ratios, which are known to overestimate risk ratio when the prevalence of exposures is relatively high. Fourth, we cannot deny the possibility that some patients were included in multiple studies especially in the China CDC report 14 and other Chinese studies. Nonetheless, the pooled estimates were largely similar in analyses that excluded the China CDC data (data not shown). Finally, the literature of COVID-19 is growing rapidly, and thus there is a lag time from our literature search and publication. On the other hand, our systematic review has several strengths: in-depth review of CVD and its risk factors, a clinically relevant definitions of severe COVID-19 that minimize subjective reporting, meta-regression to explore potential confounding, and relatively short elapsed time of ~2 weeks between the literature search and manuscript submission.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis found robust associations of older age and male sex as risk factors of severe COVID-19.

      "The emergence in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China of a novel pneumonia of unknown origin on the 31 st of December, 2019 was the start of an outbreak which would later be declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) (1). The name COVID-19 (acronym for \"coronavirus disease 2019\") was coined on the 11 th of February 2020 to describe presentation with severe acute respiratory disease (2). COVID-19 is caused by a novel strain of coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus belongs to the family of single stranded RNA viruses some of which have been previously described to be responsible for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (3, 4) . Although the symptoms and clinical presentation of COVID-19 is similar to SARS and MERS, the rate of spread is greater (5) . As of 25 th of March 2020, the total number of confirmed case of COVID-19 stands at 459,419 with 20,818 deaths globally and the number is projected to increase (6) .\n",
      "\n",
      "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common, persistent and preventable dysfunction of the lung associated with limitation in airflow. COPD is a complex disease associated with abnormalities of the airway and/ or alveoli which is predominantly caused by exposure to noxious gases and particulates over a long period (7). With a global prevalence of 251 million cases in 2016, and 3.17 million (5%) deaths in 2015 alone, COPD was ranked by the WHO as the third leading cause of death especially with a particular burden in low-and middle-income countries (8, 9) . This burden is predicted to grow due mainly to increased global exposure to tobacco, aging populations, poor awareness and inadequate access to diagnosis (10) . COPD exacerbations are a major event in the natural history of the disease associated with worsening of symptoms often resulting in hospitalisation and poor prognosis (11) . Various factors have been described to contribute to acute worsening of COPD, however, viral infection remains the main trigger, including seasonal coronaviruses (12) (13) (14) .\n",

We provide an updated report in relation to smokers (32) . Our main outcomes show that the prevalence of COPD in COVID-19 patients was low, but that the risk of severity (63%) and mortality (60%) were high, which indicates COPD patients with confirmed COVID-19 are at a greater risk of severe complications and death.\n",

We speculate that patients may have not been diagnosed. Having a reliable estimate of the prevalence of COPD in COVID-19 cases, and likely outcomes, is crucial to ensure specific successful global preventive and treatment strategies for COPD patients.

These studies did not give details about the underlying COPD. It would have been interesting to know if the frequency of previous exacerbations was linked to increased complications in COPD patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

      "Data from two studies (28, 30) describing COPD patients with confirmed COVID-19 show a higher mortality rate at 60%. This concurs with pre-print studies that found similarly high mortality rates (35, (44) (45) (46) (47) . Despite the small number of patients that were analysed, this increases concerns about the prognosis of this vulnerable population. However, this high mortality rate could be attributed to several factors. The majority of COPD patients have various comorbidities that may also be associated with mortality and related conditions may have been underreported because of the difficulties finding the specific cause of mortality (48) . Moreover, in patients with severe COPD, respiratory failure is the principal cause of mortality and this demands ICU intervention. It is possible that limited access to respiratory support as part of COVID-19 management may be contributing to this mortality, dependent on critical care capacity in each hospital or region. According to a recent COVID-19 report from Italy, the surge in patients requiring intensive care has been unmanageable, with 12% of positive cases requiring ICU admission (49) , more than that reported in China (18, 28). As a consequence, patients were dying because mechanical ventilation could not be offered, on top of acute shortage of clinicians who were able to manage those patients (50, 51) .

(18, 29) . The impact of smoking history on vulnerability to COVID-19 has been explored but there is limited data on the contribution of tobacco smoking to the spread of and poor outcome in COVID-19. A recent systematic review on COVID-19 and smoking including five studies found that smoking was most likely associated with the negative outcomes. This recommended further research to explore this in more detail due to limited studies (32) . Evidence from other respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, has shown that inhaled tobacco smoke raises the transmission rate and severity of viral respiratory tract infections (53) . It seems there is underlying mechanisms behind this prevalence, as smoking has been related to higher expression of ACE2 (the receptor for SARS-CoV-2) (pre-print) (54) . However, as more reports globally from diverse racial and genetic contexts become available, differences in the production of ACE2 can be further evaluated and linked to how they lead to COVID-19 vulnerability in different groups (55) .\n",

      "['E cology and evolutionary biology have provided a theoretical basis for understanding how interactions between pathogens and their environment shape epidemics. When combined with quantitative modeling methods, it offers a full systems perspective that has helped to characterize the actors, forces and interactions that create infectious diseases [1] - [9] . Classically, the pathogen-host interaction is the presumptive central determinant of infectious disease, and consequently, the focus of modeling efforts: understand it, model it carefully, and one gains a picture for how epidemics arise and persist.\\n\\nThese methods have been successful in balancing simplicity with generality, and have spawned different classes of models, summarized both in terms of the particular mathematical instruments applied (e.g. discrete-time, continuous models, network models, etc) and the particular biologies of host-pathogen systems (e.g. sexually-transmitted, vectorborne disease, food-borne pathogen, etc) [5] , [6] . These methods have been effective in many cases, supported by dozens of examples where they have captured the essential character or dynamics of an epidemic [6] , [8] . While these existing classifications have served an effective organizational and pedagogical purpose, there remains room for growth in how we translate certain epidemic phenomenon into theoretical formalism.\\n\\nA concept that has been the object of recent inquiry includes infections transmitted indirectly between hosts via a surface or reservoir intermediate-often abiotic-where the pathogen lives freely and independently of a host [10] - [27] , sometimes described as \"sit and wait\" infections [28] . Much of this research has concentrated on fomite, aerosol and airborne-transmitted viruses [10] , [11] , [13] , [14] , [16] , [19] , [22] and waterborne infections [12] , [17] , [23] , [26] , [29] - [33] . Other studies have focused on systems where pathogens are growing in the environment [18] , or have explored indirectly-transmitted infections in theoretical terms [21] , [24] . One framework for studying indirect, environmental transmission-the environmental infection transmission systems (E.I.T.S)-is engineered with explicit constraints that render its application necessarily narrow [15] . We offer that these prior treatments are individual examples of a general phenomenon that would benefit from a mathematical treatment that is both more rigorous and more broadly applicable. This new formalism should accommodate a widerrange of pathogens than have been previously considered and should emphasize how the environment can comprise multiple discrete dynamic entities (not unlike how host populations are often modeled).\\n\\nIn this study, we develop the \"waterborne, abiotic and other indirectly transmitted\" (W.A.I.T. or WAIT) paradigm, a generalized framework for understanding \"sit and wait\" pathogens that are indirectly transmitted through an environmental reservoir intermediate. As the WAIT perspective specifically focuses on the peculiar dynamics of environmental compartments, we argue that it is imbued with more features and applies to a broader set of examples than prior treatments. To demonstrate its novelty and range of application, we fully examine its common relevance to two otherwise disparate modern diseases: cholera and hepatitis C virus. The study proceeds in stages: (1) we first introduce a purely theoretical iteration of WAIT using a standard epidemiological model, explaining how to conceptualize an infection in terms of the WAIT framework, and deriving the reproductive number (R 0 ) using analytical methods. (2) We apply the WAIT perspective to a waterborne disease that has been the object of several modeling exercises: the transmission of Vibrio cholerae in a densely populated setting with limited access to clean drinking water. (3) We then apply the WAIT perspective to a completely different, less-explored disease case: an HCV epidemic among injection drug users (IDU) in a modern urban setting. These constitute different epidemics in terms of pathogen type (Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative bacterium, HCV a single-stranded RNA virus) and setting. Nonetheless, we conceptualize and model each epidemic scenario, highlighting mathematical features that are unique to the WAIT framework. We discuss how this lens provides new perspective on cholera outbreaks and especially the modern HCV epidemic.\\n\\nWhile the emphasis of our examination will reside in how we analyze several modern epidemic systems with the WAIT framework, for explanatory purposes we will begin by describing how it modifies very basic concepts in a classic, purposefully prosaic susceptible-infected-recovered (S-I-R or SIR) mathematical model. While this is analogous to prior methods used to discuss indirect or environmental transmission [17] , a full appreciation of both cases discussed in this study (cholera and HCV) would benefit from a full, transparent explanation of the WAIT model-building process. The method is defined by modeling changes in a population of susceptible hosts (\"S\"), infected hosts (\"I\") and recovered (\"R\"). Classically, flow through the system is defined by contact between susceptible and infected individuals, often driven by a β factor, or transmission coefficient.\\n\\nThe WAIT framework would apply to a scenario where the individuals in such a system become infected through an environmental intermediate. Figure 1 is a compartmental model that depicts this interaction, with the two [W] (for \"WAIT\") compartments influencing (dashed line) the flow of hosts from the susceptible to infected compartments.\\n\\nThe S, I, and R compartments represent the usual susceptible, infected, and recovered populations of hosts. W u and W i represent uninfected and infected populations of environmental hosts, respectively.\\n\\nIn traditional SIR models, the rate of new infection (arrow from the S compartment to the I) is generally proportional to the product of the susceptible and the infected populations, i.e. proportional to SI. In the WAIT framework, the environmental compartment, and not a host, drives the rate of infection. In this specific example, the W i compartment drives the infection such that the rate of infection is proportional to SW i . Fig. 1 : Adapted SIR compartmental diagram. This depicts a standard SIR style compartmental model with the added compartments (shaded) corresponding to the WAIT environment. Note the dynamical properties of the W i and W u compartments. It is these dynamics that set the WAIT perspective apart from others: environments are often dynamical systems, with an ecology of their own.\\n\\nThe epidemic is then driven by a series of interactions: interactions between uninfected (susceptible) hosts S and the infected (transmitting) environmental compartment W i and interactions between infected individuals I and the uninfected environmental compartment W u . The epidemic is sustained through infected hosts I depositing pathogen into the environmental intermediate, creating new infection in the reservoir, which can then interact with and infect more susceptible hosts S, in a process resembling a feedback loop. The dynamics of such a system as we have chosen to model them are captured by the set of dynamical equations below and can be visualized in Figure 1 . A derivation of the terms in the model can be read in the Supplemental Appendix.\\n\\nEquations 1-5 define the prosaic SIR model. π S is the birthrate of new susceptible hosts in the environment and µ is the fractional death rate of hosts. In this context, β represents the strength of the interaction between the susceptible hosts S and the environment. This will generally be proportional to the rate of contact between the two, and will generally include a factor in it that accounts for the probability that an exposure event actually leads to a new infected host. Similarly, α characterizes the strength of interaction between infected hosts I and the environmental reservoir; it is also generally proportional to the contact rate between the two and will contain a factor accounting for the probability that when an environmental agent is exposed to infection, it will render the agent infected. ν represents the fractional recovery rate, π W is the birthrate of new uninfected environmental agents, and k is the fractional death rate of the environmental agents.\\n\\nD. WAIT framework influences the basic reproductive number in a standard SIR model\\n\\nAs an example of how the WAIT model provides a new take on traditional concepts, we briefly consider how the value of the basic reproductive ratio R 0 in this model compares to its SIR counterpart. While R 0 can have different theoretical formulations, we rely on definitions as provided by Jones (2007) [34] and Diekmann et al. 2009 [35] . In a density-dependent SIR model with constant birth of susceptible hosts π S and death rate proportional to the host population −µS, the R 0 value is given by:\\n\\nor sometimes, more simply, R SIR 0 = β/ν, depending on the form of the SIR equations used, e.g. density-dependent, frequency-dependent, constant population, etc. β in this equation is the traditional transmission coefficient. In this classic case, it represents the coupling strength between two non-environmental agents, and not one between the environment and the traditional hosts, as in the WAIT iteration. π S , µ, and ν have the same interpretation as in our model.\\n\\nAlternatively, the value of R 0 for the WAIT iteration takes the form:\\n\\nThe R 0 formulae (equations 6-7) highlight differences between the models: The square root in the WAIT version arises as a consequence of implementing two infected agents (I and W i ) into the model, as opposed to just one in the SIR case. Next, one notices that the β factor in the SIR formula is augmented by the additional factor α in the WAIT formula, representing a kind of shared dependence between the couplings controlling the I-interaction (α) and the Sinteraction (β), with the environment. Analogously, what was the responsibility of π S in the SIR formula is now a shared dependence on π S /π W , the ratio of the birthrate of susceptible hosts to that of uninfected environmental agents.\\n\\nIn this case, the two appear as a ratio under the square root, as opposed to a product in the αβ case, indicating that these parameters have opposite effects on the value of R 0 : when π W is increased, R 0 decreases, but when π S is increased, R 0 increases. Whereas, both the α and β terms will increase the value of R 0 when increased. This presentation allows one to disaggregate the dependencies of the disease burden, as parameterized by R 0 , between hosts and environmental agents.\\n\\nAn additional observation can be made regarding the form of the R 0 in the WAIT iteration. R W AIT 0 can be viewed as a geometric mean of two other R 0 -like values: (1) number of new host infections caused infected environmental agents, and (2) number of new environmental agent infections caused by infected hosts. The first of these R 0 -like quantities can be calculated using the rate equations above (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) , assuming that the system is near the disease free equilibrium (DFE)the regime where R 0 is calculated. One will find that the rate of new host infections caused by infected environmental agents, near the DFE, is given by βπ S /(µπ W ). The second R 0 -like quantity refers to the number of new environmental agent infections caused by infected hosts, near the DFE. One will find that this value is given by, α/(µ+ν). Thus, one can see that the form of R 0 given in equation 7 can be written as,\\n\\nThe details of the full calculation can be found in the Supplemental Appendix. Thus, the full R 0 for the WAIT system represents a kind of average of the associated R 0 values for the different modes of transmission. By stressing the role of environmental reservoirs, this modelling perspective has the capacity to dissect properties of dynamics that other models may omit.\\n\\nConstructing models using the WAIT framework requires an understanding of the specific biologies of the agents involved in the system of interest. Consequently, the use of the WAIT framework is as much a conceptual exercise as it is a mathematical one, driven by domain expertise on the problem of interest. The implementation of the framework can be summarized by three key concept-activities:\\n\\n• Identify the relevant agent-compartments that define the dynamics of the system of interest (e.g. S, I, R, latent infected, etc.) and construct a compartmental model that captures interactions between them.\\n\\n• If infection in the system is driven by interactions between hosts and an environmental reservoir, one can consider and model dynamics of the latter independently. One should ask how pathogens are deposited in this reservoir, and if/how the pathogen of interest replicates and/or survives in this setting. This is a key point of innovation, as it allows the modeler to think carefully about the biology and ecology of the environmental reservoir.\\n\\n• Consider how the WAIT reservoir interacts with hosts. How does this interaction occur? What parameters would define how effectively pathogens are transmitted into the reservoir? Note that the nature of this reservoir can be : it can be large or small, liquid or solid, mobile or immobile, and there could also be multiple reservoirs. It is generally abiotic in nature, as the transmitting reservoir isn\\'t a living organism as in vector-borne diseases (one could consider some exceptions, but these descriptions hold for most cases).\\n\\nHaving proposed a brief outline for how to think about and model a disease system using the WAIT perspective, we will apply it to two different, modern epidemic scenarios: first cholera in a densely populated setting with limited access to clean drinking water, and then hepatitis C virus in a community of injection drug users.\\n\\nHere we present a WAIT-style model of cholera (caused by the gram negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae), which has been the object of prior modeling efforts [12] , [29] - [31] , [33] . This specific iteration is based on a simulation of a 2010 outbreak in Haiti [32] . It is set with a population of 400,000 (the approximate population of the Carrefour section of Port Au Prince, Haiti), features seven ordinary differential equations, seven compartmentalized agents, and twenty parameters. It contains high-infectious and low-infectious water reservoirs, which are the mode of transmission [36] . Recent studies have examined other modes of transmission in cholera, (including transmission within households) [37] , but we have chosen to focus on waterborne transmission. Treatment and prevention is undertaken via vaccination, antibiotic administration, and modification of the contaminated water dynamics.\\n\\nThe model can be visualized using a compartmental diagram as seen in Figure 2 . Some general features, which reflect findings in prior studies [32] , [36] , [38] , include the following:\\n\\n• Disease is acquired by individuals as they become infected from drinking water from either the lowinfectious or high-infectious reservoirs. • Infected individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic)\\n\\nshed bacteria into the high-infectious reservoir. • Bacteria are removed from the system either via decay in the low-infectious reservoir, or via the death of infected individuals. These reservoirs differ in how much V. cholerae exist in a given amount of water, with the high-infectious reservoir much more likely to cause disease.\\n\\n• Some individuals are vaccinated and individuals return to the susceptible compartment as their vaccine induced immunity wanes. • Individuals enter and exit the system via equal natural birth and death rates, as well as a death rate due to the disease. Since natural birth and death rates are equal, and additional death can occur from disease, there is a loss of susceptible individuals as the model moves forward through time.\\n\\nC. Cholera WAIT model: Analytic equations and parameters The set of ordinary differential equations (Eq. 9-15) define the dynamics of the system. As outlined in the \"elementary adapted S.I.R example,\" the environmental dynamics are realized within their own set of differential equations. κ L,H +B L,H terms in Eq. 9-11 quantify the likelihood that an individual, per day, will be infected with V. cholerae given the contaminated water consumption rate α. These terms are constructed using the minimum low and high infectious reservoir dose in units of cells per day. Other notable terms include, α the water consumption rate and ξ s the symptomatic individuals excretion rate.\\n\\nThe initial conditions across all simulations included a population of 400,000 susceptible individuals with an initial small amount of Vibrio cholerae present in each reservoir to prime the outbreak (5 cells in each reservoir). Additionally, the values of the symptomatic, asymptomatic, vaccinated, and recovered compartments were set to zero.\\n\\nThe simulation was constructed with a time step resolution of 10,000 over a period of 130 days. Figure 3 provides an overview of the dynamics of the disease and the effect of potential interventions. From these simulations, we can observe the behavior of the infected populations (symptomatic and asymptomatic), both of which grow rapidly in the first 20 days of simulation time ( Figure 3A ). The symptomatic group peaks first, shortly after which the asymptomatic group rises to a higher value. The decay that is seen in the latter days of the outbreak naturally occurs as the total number of susceptible individuals decreases. Further discussion regarding the long term behavior of the model, as well as the susceptible, recovered and vaccinated populations can be found in the Supplemental Appendix.\\n\\nUsing the WAIT environmental reservoir equations, one can model the relative changes in water reservoir infectiousness. In Figure 3b , we observe the high-infectious reservoir peak first, driven by the symptomatic population\\'s shedding of bacteria into the aquatic environmental reservoir. This behavior is is propelled by high excretion rate of symptomatically infected individuals (ξ s ), which is three orders of magnitude larger than (ξ A ). The high-infectious reservoir drives the rise of new infected cases. As the system moves forward in time, the high-infectious reservoir decays via the χ parameter, which shifts the disease-driving burden to the low-infectious reservoir.\\n\\nVaccination is approximated as a constant number of individuals vaccinated per day, resulting in a linear increase in the vaccinated population. On long time scales (greater than 2500 days) the recovered population peaks and declines as the total number of susceptible individuals ultimately decays, which no longer resembles realistic disease dynamics. Further exploration of this behavior can be found in the Supplemental Appendix.\\n\\nE. Cholera WAIT model parameters influence the R 0\\n\\nThe R 0 provides a signature of the average infectiousness of a given pathogen in a given setting [34] , [35] . In this model, given the parameters, R 0 = 0.199 (A derivation of the analytic expression for R 0 , as well as details regarding the sensitivity analysis, can be found in the Supplementary Appendix.) Thus, in its current configuration, the model does not describe a self-sustaining epidemic. (This is observable through the decay of the asymptomatic and symptomatic cases as depicted in Figure 3a) . Additionally, the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix for the ODE system at the diseasefree equilibrium are real numbers less then or equal to zero, with the largest eigenvalue being zero. Consequently, given enough time, the flow of disease will move to the disease free equilibrium. Compound staggered interventions mimicking an example real world disease management strategy.\\n\\nThe relative sensitivity of R 0 to changes in the model parameters was examined, and we find that p, W , α, and ξ S are the four most sensitive parameters. These include two parameters strongly related to WAIT aspects of the model: the rate of contaminated water consumption α, and the total water reservoir size W . Further analysis was also conducted to better understand how adjustments to the model parameters can push R 0 > 1. The results of these analysis can be found in the Supplemental Appendix.\\n\\nHaving explained the model structure and analyzed parameter influences on the basic reproductive ratio, we then analyzed a range of potential interventions, comparing their impact on various properties of the cholera dynamics. Specifically, we examine three types of interventions: vaccination, antibiotic administration, and water purification. Each were realized by modifying the respective model parameters that encode information relevant to that intervention. Figure 3 shows various iterations of the simulation, tracking the sum of both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in the standard model (Figure 3a) , with various different interventions implemented (3c, 3d). In Figure 3c , we observe how the effect of daily vaccine administration manifests most clearly in the longer term (>100 days) behavior of the dynamics, where it can eventually exceed the effects of reduction in contaminated water consumption (if vaccine effectiveness is sufficiently high). We can also see the large impact of instantaneously reducing contaminated water consumption on the number of infected individuals (in terms of both number of infected individuals, and the rate at which that impact manifests). For example, increasing antibiotic, and vaccine administration two-fold has less immediate impact on disease dynamics than decreasing contaminated water consumption even by a quarter. Together, the cholera WAIT model offers the hypothesis that ideal interventions might include a combination of long-term (e.g. vaccination) and short-term (e.g. water purification) interventions to limit the number of infected cases.\\n\\nLastly, compound intervention dynamics are considered (Figure 3d) . These aim to simulate disease management strategies where, given practical strategies such as resource allocation and response time, a staggered or combined response is more likely to be implemented. We chose this particular compound intervention to demonstrate how the WAIT model can broadly accommodate the types of modifications that represent public health interventions.\\n\\n6 .

In this model, needles serve as the environmental intermediate for infection, and the sharing of infected needles will constitute the means of transmitting new infection. Note that while the term \"needle\" is only one part of a syringe, we use it to refer to the entire syringe. HCV can also be transmitted sexually [57] , but in this paper we restrict our attention to transmission through infected needles. As with the cholera model, this section of the main text focuses on the main structure and dynamical properties of the model. Further model details and discussion can be found in the Supplemental Appendix.\\n\\nWe model the dynamics of needle populations, injection drug users, and infected individuals through a series of five ordinary differential equations. The compartments, labeled S, I E , I L , N u , and N i represent the populations of susceptible individuals, early-infected individuals (sometimes referred to as acutely infected), late-stage infected individuals (sometimes referred to as chronically infected), uninfected needles, and infected needles, respectively. This model has several features:\\n\\n• The susceptible compartment refers to individuals who are injecting drugs and who are sharing needles with other members in the IDU community. • The needle population is divided into two compartments: infected and uninfected, and we model the dynamics of each compartment separately. • New infections (of both people and needles) will depend on the fraction of infected or uninfected needles in circulation. • There are various estimates for the ability of HCV to survive in needles [58] [59] . We incorporate HCV freeliving survival via the parameter , which quantifies the rate at which the virus spontaneously clears from infected needles.\\n\\nThe dynamics of the HCV transmission process are governed by equations 16-20. The population of individuals who are being treated and those who have recovered are not explicitly modeled in this WAIT iteration, as the dynamics of treatment and recovery are not central to the questions explored in this study. There are, however, several modeling studies of HCV that focus on treatment [60] - [63] , and their effects are not ignored in the HCV WAIT model. Entering or leaving treatment (and re-entering the susceptible population, as in case of drug relapse in the IDU population) are approximated by the \"birth\" terms π S and π T and removal terms −τ I L and −τ I E .\\n\\nπ S is the birthrate (via migration or first-time use) of new members into a given community of injection drug users (constant in this model). This includes those who may be returning to the population of IDU after recovering from HCV. π T represents the rate that individuals enter the infected stage coming from an unsuccessful treatment program. φ represents the daily fraction of individuals infected with HCV who spontaneously clear the infection. c represents the rate of sharing a needle with another user (infected or otherwise) per capita. β represents the probability that an uninfected individual will convert to HCV+ after injection with an infected needle. µ is the combined fractional death and IDU cessation rate (individuals who leave the IDU community). π I represents the rate of migration of early stage infected individuals into the study population of IDU (assumed to be constant). ω is the daily fraction of earlystage infected individuals who progress to the late-stage of infection. τ is the daily fraction of infected individuals who go into treatment. π N is the rate of introduction of uninfected needles into the population of IDU. γ is the average number of injections per user per day. ζ represents the probability that a new needle becomes infected after use by an infected user. k u is the daily fraction of uninfected needles which are discarded. k i is the daily fraction of infected needles which are discarded. Lastly, is the fraction of infected needles which become uninfected in the period of a day due to deactivation (or \"death\") of virus populations on the needle. Parameter values and sources can be seen in Table II .\\n\\nHaving constructed and elaborated on the details of the HCV WAIT model, we now explore how parameters related to the environment (in this case, those framing the population of infected needles) influence the R 0 . We directly measured the influence of parameters on the R 0 by considering the effect of modifying the parameters. The value of R 0 was calculated using established methods [34] , [35] , and is also found to conform to a geometric mean of two other R 0 -like quantities, just as in our adapted SIR model in section II. The full calculation and its presentation as a geometric mean is outlined in the Supplemental Appendix.\\n\\nFrom the form of R 0 given in equation 21, one could surmise that several parameters in the formula have comparable sensitivities. We tested this directly by calculating the Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) for each of the parameters in the model, with respect to R 0 , based on methods used in prior studies [64] . We find that parameters related to an interaction with the environmental reservoir (the population of needles) such as k u (the fractional discard rate of uninfected needles), γ (the rate of daily injections per capita), and π N (the birthrate of new needles) are as central to HCV dynamics as traditionally considered parameters, such as π S (the birthrate of susceptibles), c (the contact or sharing rate of IDU), or µ (the combined death and cessation rate of IDU) ( Figure 5 ). This fortifies the notion that WAIT-specific properties dictate the spread of HCV, providing opportunities to explore more precise targeting by public health interventions.\\n\\nHaving demonstrated the structural relevance of the WAIT framework in terms of how it influences the basic reproductive number, we can consider the utility of the model with respect to other properties, including how it offers insight into potential interventions. Fig. 5 : R 0 sensitivity in HCV: the Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC). A PRCC calculation was performed for R 0 using Latin Hypercube Sampling. Parameters were sampled from uniform distributions with widths specified by the ranges given in Table II . The PRCC calculation was repeated for 50 independent iterations. The average of these iterations is shown here, with the standard deviations for each parameter shown as the error bars.\\n\\nOne such intervention may be the implementation of needle-exchange programs. Needle-exchange programs are an example of \"harm reduction\" public health strategies that aim to reduce harm stemming from behaviors that put the affected individuals or communities at risk [65] . These policies are controversial, but have been demonstrated to be effective interventions for HIV and HCV in certain settings [66] . With respect to the HCV WAIT model, some of these programs (especially ones targeting injection equipment, like safe injection sites) can increase the discard rate of infected needles by providing a safe location to use and discard needles, while also providing uninfected needles to IDU. In our model, parameters like the needle discard rate, k i and k u , and π N are affected by needle exchange programs. Figure  6 demonstrates how R 0 is affected by these parameters. One can see that R 0 can be reduced by increasing k i -the infected needle discard rate-along a fixed value of π Nthe birthrate of uninfected needles-and that increasing π N along a fixed value of k i has the same effect. It is also evident that R 0 can be reduced more rapidly by increasing k i and π N simultaneously, as expected. In this way, the proportion of infected needles is reduced because of an increase in clean needles and a reduction of infected ones, lowering R 0 .\\n\\nIn Figure 6 , we demonstrate how changing k u and k i modifies the value of R 0 . Notice that R 0 is reduced by increasing k i across fixed values of k u . The opposite effect is observed when increasing k u along fixed values of k i . That is, removing infected needles at an increased rate may decrease infection risk in a population of IDU, while doing the opposite can increase the risk. One can also see that increasing k u and k i simultaneously along the dashed linewhere k u = k i -will increase R 0 . This indicates that if a distinction between infected and uninfected needles cannot be established in a given setting, then it may be more helpful to add a higher proportion of uninfected needles than it would be to remove a higher proportion of all needles.\\n\\nIn this study, we propose a framework-the waterborne, abiotic and other indirectly transmitted pathogen paradigm (WAIT)-for modeling infectious diseases where transmission is dictated by an interaction between hosts and dynamic multi-compartment environmental reservoirs. We use it to explore two very different modern epidemics of significant public health consequence: cholera and hepatitis C virus. We first establish it through a simple form, an elementary adapted SIR formulation, and highlight how it modifies fundamental properties of epidemics such as the basic reproductive number (R 0 ). We then build mathematical models to explore cholera and HCV disease dynamics. We demonstrate how the integrated framework highlights potentially overlooked properties of these systems, and highlights potential avenues for intervention. The model is compatible with existing canon in epidemiology, and can accommodate theory in the ecology and evolution of infectious disease. For example, the \"curse of the pharaoh hypothesis,\" which predicts that pathogens with high free-living survival can be more virulent [78] , can be modeled on a population scale using the WAIT framework. In addition, its careful treatment of environmental dynamics makes it amenable to questions regarding how changes in climate, social policy, or behavior may influence the spread of disease.\\n\\nIn the context of cholera, modeling the aquatic reservoir allows us to interrogate the interplay between several notable aspects of cholera epidemics. For example, the interaction between the relative size of the body of water and changes in infected populations, and the notion that the symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious populations fuel different aspects of the epidemic (initial and longer-term phase, respectively). These are areas of present and future inquiry.\\n\\nIn the context of HCV, the WAIT perspective reveals that the dynamics of injection needle populations are crucial to the spread of HCV, which offers a lens on approaches that might attenuate outbreaks of HCV. To the best of our knowledge, no existing mathematical model of HCV epidemiology has interrogated the dynamics in this manner. It is our hope that the HCV modeling community exploits and improves upon this perspective by further adapting the model to study HCV in specific settings.\\n\\nMore generally, The WAIT framework is driven by a contextual understanding of the disease dynamics, where the model parameterization follows the intuition of the scientist. Consequently, it broadens the scope of diseases that can be responsibly understood using mathematical or computational models, potentially generates hypotheses, and fosters improved recapitulation (and possibly prediction) of epidemics driven by \"sit and wait\" pathogens.\\n\\nThe authors would like to thank B.Linas for input on the parameters.

For the estimation of CFR in real time, we employ the delay from hospitalization to 100 death, hs, which is assumed to be given by hs = H(s) -H(s-1) for s>0 where H(s) is a cumulative density 101 function of the delay from hospitalization to death and follows a gamma distribution with mean 10.1 days 102 and SD 5.4 days, according to a recent study that estimated the CFR in China [18] . We let πa,ti be the time- All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, 120 Austria) using the 'rstan' package. 121\\n\\nAs of March 21, 2020, a total of 8,799 cases and 102 deaths of COVID- 19 In this paper we have derived estimates of the CFR for the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Korea, 151 a country that has relies on intensive social distancing and mass testing of suspected COVID-19 cases to 152 mitigate incidence levels of the disease and deliver early medical care to the most vulnerable, potentially 153 lowering the risk of death. Specifically, we have estimated time-delay adjusted CFR in three different 154 geographic areas in Korea and found that the most severely affected areas were Gyeongsangbuk-do while 155 the rest of Korea exhibits milder severity impact. Specifically, the delay-adjusted CFR in Gyeongsangbuk-156 do, largely driven by hospital-based transmission, was relatively high, being estimated at 2.4% (95% CrI: 157 1.6-3.4%), which is about 2-fold higher than our estimate for Daegu and for all regions in Korea. These 158 findings suggest that the situation in Gyeongsangbuk-do is more severe compared with the other affected 159 areas in Korea. 160\\n\\nOne can note a considerable increase in fatality risks with older age by multiple folds, with the 161 oldest age group exhibiting the highest case fatality. It was also reported that the risk of symptomatic 162 infection also increases with age, although this may be partially affected by preferential ascertainment of 163 In addition, our estimates on CFR are relatively lower than the CFR obtained from affected areas in China 174 (ranging from 1.41%-5.25%), based on the cases and deaths observed to date [18, 29] . In general, the CFR 175 of the same disease might vary greatly in different countries or even different regions of the same country, 176 partially due to differences in health control policies, availability of healthcare, medical standards, and 177 detection efficiency. In Korea, an extensive COVID-19 testing regime has been instituted, and authorities 178 launched a massive contact tracing as case numbers grew. As a result, the country has tested more people In conclusion, our estimates of the risk for death from COVID-19 in Korea as of March 21, 2020, 221 were as high as 2.4% in Gyeongsangbuk-do and as low as 0.7% in the less severely affected areas in Korea, 222 and this difference in CFR is likely influenced by nosocomial transmission of the disease. In the absence 223 of pharmaceutical interventions (i.e., vaccination and antiviral drugs), the control of COVID-19 is highly 224 dependent on public health interventions including social distancing measures, isolation of the infected, 225 delayed school openings, and extensive testing of potential contacts of confirmed cases. The estimates of 226 CFR associated with COVID-19 is thus critical to help inform the assessments of health impacts and to 227 determine both the intensity and appropriateness of mitigation strategies as the epidemic unfolds. 228 \\n\\n\", 'Title: Estimating the risk of COVID-19 death during the course of the outbreak in Korea', 'In our previous recent work (Hermanowicz 2020) , we used a simple logistic model to analyze the evolution of data on Covid-19 cases as reported in mainland China by the National Health Commission of the People\\'s Republic of China (NHC 2020) . This initial analysis was done in three phases in near-real time (up to Jan. 30, Feb. 3, and Feb 6) . The analysis resulted in a sequence of continually updated forecasts of the epidemic dynamics. Although the predicted maximum numbers of cases increased as new data became available, they systematically underestimated final reported numbers (even without accounting for a major change in reporting criteria in China on February 12 resulting in a large surge of new reported cases). However, the successive predicted dynamics of the epidemic were remarkably close to the final real-world outcome. We explore this issue further in this work where we use the full reported dataset for mainland China for systematic back-casting of the epidemic. At the same time, when this work is being conducted, in the US we are experiencing a fast developing Covid-19 epidemic that in some aspects is similar to China but with a delay. We use the experience from our analysis of the situation in China to forecast further evolution of coronavirus cases in the United States. Obviously, our predictions are based on the data currently available. These predictions do not account for any possible other secondary sources of infection, changes of diagnostics or reporting, or virus mutation.\\n\\nModelling the epidemics and infection dynamics is very important and numerous results have been recently reported for worldwide Covid-19 outbreak (Chen, Rui et al. 2020 , Chen, Cheng et al. 2020 , Hui, Azhar et al. 2020 , Li, Guan et al. 2020 , Liu, Hu et al. 2020 , Liu, Hewings et al. 2020 , Roosa, Lee et al. 2020 , Shen, Peng et al. 2020 , Zhao, Lin et al. 2020 , Zhou, Hong et al. 2020 , Ziff and Ziff 2020 . Many reported models are complicated, incorporate tentative assumptions and need parameters estimates that are not reliable as underscored by Fong and coworkers (Fong, Li et al. 2020) .\\n\\nIn this work, we present the results of fitting a very simple logistic model to the available data and a forecast of new infections. In contrast to other models, the logistic model does not include any external assumptions and is derived completely from available data.\\n\\nThe logistic model is one of the simplest used in population dynamics and has been used specifically for epidemics for a long time (Bailey 1950 , Cockburn 1960 , Mansfield and Hensley 1960 , Jowett, Browning et al. 1974 , Waggoner and Aylor 2000 , Koopman 2004 , Bangert, Molyneux et al. 2017 . In our earlier analysis of the developing epidemic in China, we used a discrete version of the model due to its uncomplicated structure and easy calculations.\\n\\nIn discrete time, more appropriate to daily reported infection cases, the logistic model becomes\\n\\nwhere P(t) and P(t+1) are populations (cases) on consecutive days, R0 * is the growth rate (basic reproduction number in epidemiology) at the beginning of the logistic growth, and K is the limiting population (maximum cases).\\n\\nHowever, expressing the growth of population P in continuous time t allows to formulate the model as an ordinary first-order differential equation describing dynamic evolution of the population P (in our case the number of infected individuals) being controlled by the growth rate r and maximum cases K due to limited growth. In continuous time t, the change of P is\\n\\nInitially, the growth of P is close to exponential since the term (1 − ⁄ ) is almost one. When P becomes larger (commensurate with K) the growth rate slows down with\\n\\nbecoming an effective instantaneous growth rate.\\n\\nThe solution to Eq. (2) is the well-known sigmoidal function (logistic function)\\n\\nwhere t0 is the time when the population reaches one-half of the maximum value P(t0) = ½ K.\\n\\nUsing a differential version of the model is more convenient since a closed-form solution exists and allows for direct estimation of three model parameters: K, r, and t0. The logistic model may be adequate for the analysis of mainland China and the US as a whole since at this time each country can be treated as a unit where a vast majority of cases occurred without any significant \"import\" or \"export\" of cases.\\n\\nFor China, we used data reported daily by the National Health Commission of the People\\'s Republic of China (NHC 2020) up to March 13, 2020 (day 87 from the outbreak) when only 11 new cases were reportedless than 2\\uf0d710 -4 of total case number, effectively ending the epidemic on the national level. There is a considerable controversy as to the exact date of the outbreak with most reports pointing to mid-December (Li, Guan et al. 2020 , Wang, Horby et al. 2020 while one analysis suggest multiple sources of original infection ). Initially, the outbreak was not recognized and number of confirmed cases is not fully known (Wu, Hao et al. 2020) . In our analysis, we adopted December 17, 2019 as the best estimate of the outbreak following the work of Zhang and co-workers . In addition, in the initial stages of the epidemic the reported numbers of cases may severely underestimate the actual numbers due to asymptomatic carriers (Zhao, Musa et al. 2020 ). More accurate numbers can be only estimated after the epidemic (Wu and McGoogan 2020) .\\n\\nThe data from China are show in Figure 1 and in the Appendix. As seen in this figure, the cumulative number of cases grew in a sigmoidal fashion. On February 12, 2020 (day 57) the reporting criteria were changed resulting in a one-day increase of about 15,000 cases. We analyzed the subsequent data with this jump and also ignoring it. The logistic model turned out to be quite robust. While the numerical estimates of the maximum number of cases K was significantly affected by the inclusion or exclusion the jump, the dynamics of the model was much less impacted (see further discussion). In this work, we decided to report the results with the jump as parsing data of new and cumulative cases past day 57 is very unreliable.\\n\\n.

For this reason, we relied on web-based data aggregators (mostly at state level) following daily updates (Covid-19 2020).\\n\\nWe used January 21, 2020 as the start of the epidemic in the US (day 1) since on that day the first non-repatriated Covid-19 case was reported. It should be noted that like in China the number of cases in the initial stages is underreported due to the same factors (asymptomatic carriers, initial administrative confusion, limited testing). Despite these problems, the data used in this work are the best currently available. The current evolution of the epidemic in the US is presented in Figure 1 and in the Appendix. Despite smaller population, the number of cases in the US at the time of writing already exceeds that of China. Reasons for such higher numbers are outside the scope of this analysis.\\n\\nBoth, China and the US data are also plotted in the semi-log format (??) to underscore exponential growth of the epidemic in the initial stagesstraight line on these plots.

We use a custom nonlinear curve fitting procedure employing the Levenberg-Marquardt method for minimization of the residual sum of squares. Similarly to our previous work (Hermanowicz 2020), we estimated model parameters sequentially from datasets growing day after day.\\n\\nFor China, the first dataset contained 5 days from day 38 through 42. The next estimate used 6 days from day 38 through 43. This process was repeated until day 87 when the entire China dataset was used. For the US, the first dataset contained also 5 days from day 43 through 47. The last day of the available sequence for the US was day 70 (March 30, 2020).

In the US, where we are still in the substantial growth phase, the sequential estimates are indeed performed in nearreal time. In addition to three model parameters, for each day we also estimated predicted time for the epidemic to end. For this purpose. we chose arbitrarily time when the predicted number of cases reach 95% of the predicted maximum K. This time, t95 was calculated from Eq. (4) by setting P(t) = 0.95 K and is also shown in the Appendix. Figure 3 shows the development of sequential estimates of the maximum predicted cases K for China and Figure 4 presents the corresponding \"ending times\" t95. As reported earlier (Hermanowicz 2020) for actual near-real time analysis, estimates of predicted maximum cases K depended very heavily on the length of the dataset used for estimation. As examples, Figure 5 shows a few logistic curves corresponding to selected model parameter estimates on specific days for China. As seen in this figure, the initial estimates (close to the exponential phase) were below 20,000 but they grew to about 100,000 as more data became available and was used for estimate refinement. Obviously, the estimate of K obtained from the full dataset (up to day 87) matches closely the actual reported number of cases (80,780 vs. 80,807) but it should be noted that the estimates of K from day 65 (more than 20 days in advance) converged very closely to the actual maximum.

The immediate result was a very large increase in the estimated maximum cases K (Figure 3 ), approximately doubling it from about 50,000 on day 56 to about 99,400 on day 59. This big increase underscores again the sensitivity of the logistic model to data quality. However, the model is also robust in a longer term as the K estimates quickly converged toward their ultimate values.\\n\\nSimilarly, there was also a significant jump in the estimates of t95 (see Figure 4 ) due to the jump in the case numbers. However, it is remarkable that the estimates of the \"end time\" t95 were much more constrained and much closer to the actual value. Even as early as three weeks before the end of the epidemic the estimates of the \"end time\" were between 60 and 70 days, very close to the final value of 67 days.\\n\\nUnlike China, the epidemic in the US is still at the growth phase, perhaps deviating slightly from the exponential growth. Thus, the available dataset is much smaller and the logistic model estimates are burdened with much larger uncertainty. Currently available estimates of the .

They exhibit very large variations increasing from approximately 1,100 on day 47 to approximately 265,000 on day 70 without any sign of leveling off. This large variation is not unexpected since the nearly exponential growth does not contain sufficient information on the actual maximum. In other words, the derivative dP/dt in Eq. (2) is dominated by the term r P while (1-P/K) \\uf0bb 1. This behavior is also seen in the examples of predicted logistic curves for selected sets of estimated parameters K, r, t0 ( Figure 6 ).\\n\\nThe sequential estimates of the \"end time\" t95 are plotted in Figure 4 . They also tend to increase in time with the increasing number of reported cases but unlike the estimates of K (and similarly to the Chinese case) it varies in a much smaller interval -70 to 80 days in the past two weeks, If the behavior of the US epidemic is similar to the Chinese case, we could expect further leveling off of t95 at slightly above 80 days. If this bold prediction will hold, we could see the end of the epidemic growth around 80 -85 days after its origin, around April 10 to 14. Of course, the end here is defined as the cessation of new cases and not the complete recovery of the infected patients. .

The analysis of the relative impact of different mitigation and suppression strategies has influenced the current approach. The \"only viable strategy at the current time\" is to suppress the epidemic with all available measures, including school closures and social distancing of the entire population [3] . These analyses have highlighted from the beginning that the eventual relaxation of lock-down measures would be problematic [3, 4] . Without a considered cessation of the suppression strategies the risk of a second wave becomes signficant, possibly of greater magnitude than the first as the SARS-CoV-2 virus is now endemic in the population [5, 6] .\\n\\nAlthough much attention has been focused on the number of tests being conducted [7, 8] , not enough attention has been given to the issues of imperfect testing. Whilst poorly performing tests have not been prominent in public discourse, evidence suggests they are epidemiologically significant. The failure to detect the virus in infected patients can be a significant problem in high-throughput settings operating under severe pressure [9] . Evidence suggest that this is indeed the case [10, 11, 12, 13] .\\n\\nEveryone seems to agree that testing will be a pillar of whatever approach is employed to relax the current social distancing measures [14] . The public are rapidly becoming aware of the difference between the \\'have you got it?\\' tests for detecting active cases, and the \\'have you had it?\\' tests for the presence of antibodies, which imply some immunity to . What may be less obvious is that these different tests need to maximise different test characteristics.\\n\\nTo be useful in ending the current social distancing measures, active viral tests need to maximise the sensitivity. How good the test is at telling you that you have the disease. High sensitivity reduces the chance of missing people who have the virus who may go on to infect others. There is an additional risk that an infected person who has been incorrectly told they do not have the disease, when in fact they do, may behave in a more reckless manner than if their disease status were uncertain.\\n\\nThe second testing approach, seeking to detect the presence of antibodies to identify those who have had the disease would be used in a different strategy. This strategy would involve detecting those who have successfully overcome the virus, and are likely to have some level of immunity (or at least reduced susceptibility to more serious illness if they are infected again), so are relatively safe to relax their personal social distancing measures. This strategy would require a high test specificity, aiming to minimise how often the test tells someone they have had the disease when they haven\\'t. A false positive tells people they have immunity when they don\\'t, which is even worse than when people are uncertain about their viral history.\\n\\n2 Introduction to test statistics: What makes a \\'good\\' test?\\n\\nIn order to answer this question there are a number of important statistics:\\n\\nSensitivity σ -Out of those who actually have the disease, that fraction that received a positive test result.\\n\\nSpecificity τ -Out of these who did not have the disease, the fraction that received a negative test result.\\n\\nThe statistics that characterise the performance of the test are computed from a confusion matrix (Table 1) . We test n inf ected people who have Covid-19, and n healthy people who do not have Covid-19. In the first group, a people correctly test positive and c falsely test negative. Among healthy people, b will falsely test positive, and d will correctly test negative. From this confusion matrix the sensitivity is given by (1) and the specificity by (2) .\\n\\nSensitivity is the ratio of correct positive tests to the total number of infected people involved in the study characterising the test. The specificity is the ratio of the correct negative tests to the total number of healthy people. Importantly, these statistics depend only on the test itself and do not depend on the population the test is intended to be used upon.\\n\\nComputing the statistics require a definitive way to determine the true viral status of a patient; a so-called gold standard. If there is doubt about in which column a patient falls, the confusion matrix cannot be constructed. When novel tests are employed the confusion matrix can be very challenging to rigorously assess in the midst of a fast moving epidemic [15, 16, 17] .\\n\\nWhen the test is used for diagnostic purposes, the characteristics of the population being tested become important for interpreting the test results. To interpret the diagnostic value of a positive or negative test result the following statistics must be used:\\n\\nPrevalence p -The proportion of people in the target population that have the disease tested for.\\n\\nPositive Predictive Value P P V -How likely one is to have the disease given a positive test result.\\n\\nNegative Predictive Value N P V -How likely one is to not have the disease, given a negative test result.\\n\\nThe P P V and N P V depend on the prevalence, and hence depend on the population you are focused on. This may be the UK population, a sub population with Covid-19 compatible symptoms, or any other population you may wish to target. The P P V and N P V can then be calculated using Bayes\\' rule:\\n\\nTo improve the diagnostic performance of tests they are often repeated to increase the aggregate P P V or N P V . To do this an assumption of independence between the two tests needs to be made. This assumption could be questionable in some circumstances. For instance, it would be questionable if samples are analysed at the same time in the same lab by the same technician, or if the same method for extracting the sample from the patient is employed, it may be unsuccessful at detecting virus for the same reason. A plethora of other possible errors are imaginable. Many of these errors may be truly random, and independent, but many may not be so the independence assumption may be weakly justified.\\n\\nThe rapid development and scaling of new diagnostic systems invites error, particularly as labs are converted from other purposes and technicians are placed under pressure, and variation in test collection quality, reagent quality, sample preservation and storage, and sample registration and provenance. Assessing the magnitude of these errors on the performance of tests is challenging in real time. Point-ofcare tests are not immune to these errors and are often seen as less accurate than laboratory based tests [18, 19] .\\n\\nThe prevalence of the disease matters. The P P V can vary drastically for different populations with different prevalence. The idea that prevalence depends on the population may seem counterintuitive to some audiences. For example, if we were to select 100 people from a respiratory ward this week from any hospital in the UK, and 100 people from a street outside the building, what proportion of each population have Covid-19? If one tests both populations with the same test and found positives in each population, which would have the higher P P V ? To illustrate the impact of prevalence on P P V , for a test with σ = τ = 0.95 if prevalence p = 0.05, then the P P V ≈ 0.48. Figure 1 shows why, for 1000 test subjects there will be similar numbers of true and false positives even with high sensitivity and specificity of 95%. In contrast, using the same tests on a sample with a higher prevalence p = 0.5 we find the P P V = 0.8, see Figure 2 . Similarly, the N P V is lower when the prevalence is higher.\\n\\nThe number of active cases exceeding the test capacity may not be the only discrepancy between the true cases and reported cases. The impact of uncertainty in testing may also be contributing to the discrepancy, even in the tested population. More testing will not reduce this uncertainty. The director of the WHO suggests that testing is a crucial part of any strategy [20] , but even testing the entire country every day would not give an accurate tally of infections.\\n\\nTo explore the effect of imperfect testing on the disease dynamics when strategies are employed to relax the current social distancing measures the SIR model described in the supplimentary material was modified. Three new classes were added to the model, the first is a quarantined susceptible state, Q S , the second is a quarantined infected state, Q I , and the third is people who have recovered but are in quarantine, Q R . To model the current lock-down, the model evaluations begin with a majority of the population in the Q S (quarantined but susceptible) state. Whilst in this state the transmission rate of the disease is totally suppressed. The model evaluates each day\\'s average population-level state transitions. There are two possible tests that can be performed:\\n\\nAn active virus infection test that is able to determine whether or not someone is currently infectious. This test is performed on some proportion of the un-quarantined population (S + I + R). It has a sensitivity of σ A and a specificity of τ A .\\n\\nAn antibody test that determines whether or not someone has had the infection in the past. This is used on the fraction of the population that is currently in quarantine but not infected (Q S + Q R ) to test whether they have had the disease or not. This test has a sensitivity of σ B and a specificity of τ B .\\n\\nThese two tests are used on some of those eligible for testing each day limited by the test capacity, ρ and φ respectively. A person (in any category) who tests positive in an active virus test transitions into the (corresponding) quarantine state, where they are unable to infect anyone else. A person, in Q S or Q R , who tests positive in an antibody test transitions to S and R respectively.\\n\\nFor this parameterisation the impact of being in the susceptible quarantined state, Q S , makes an individual insusceptible to being infected. Similarly, being in the infected quarantined state, Q I , individuals are unable to infect anyone else. In practicality there is always leaking, no quarantine is entirely effective, but for the sake of exploring the impact of testing uncertainty these effects are neglected from the model. The participation in infection propagation of individuals in either quarantine state are idiosyncratic, and on average are assumed to be negligibly small for the sake of this analysis.\\n\\nIf the tests were almost perfect, then we can imagine how the epidemic would die out very quickly by either widespread infection or antibody testing with a coherent management strategy. A positive test on the former and the person is removed from the population, and positive test on the latter and the person, unlikely to contract the disease again, can join the population .\\n\\nMore interesting are the effects of incorrect test results on the disease dynamics. If someone falsely tests positive in the antibody test, they enter the susceptible state. Similarly, if an infected person receives a false negative for the disease they remain active in the infected state and hence can continue the disease propagation and infect further people.\\n\\n4 What part will testing play in relaxing current social distancing measures?\\n\\nIn order to explore the possible impact of testing strategies on the relaxation of current social distancing measures several scenarios have been analysed. These scenarios are illustrative of the type of impact, 5 .

Analogous to the International Certificate of Vaccination and Prophylaxis, antibody based testing would be used to identify those who have some level of natural immunity.\\n\\nIncremental relaxation scenario: A phased relaxation of the government\\'s social distancing advice is the most likely policy that will be employed. To understand the implications of such an approach this scenario has explored the effect of testing capacity and test performance on the possible disease dynamics under this type of policy. Under the model parameterisation this analysis has applied an incremental transition rate from the Q S state to the S state, and Q R to R.\\n\\nWhilst the authors are sensitive to the sociological and ethical concerns of any of these approaches [23, 24] , the analysis presented is purely on the question of efficacy.\\n\\nUnder the baseline scenario, characterised by the sudden and complete cessation of the current social distancing measures, we explored the impact of infection testing. Under this formulation the initial conditions of the model in this scenario is that the all of the population in Q S transition to S in the first iteration.\\n\\nAs would be expected the model indicates the second wave is an inevitability and as many as 20 million people could become infected within 30 days, figure 4. To illustrate the sensitivity of the model to testing scenarios an evaluation was conducted with a range of infection test sensitivities, from 50% (i.e of no diagnostic value) to 98%. The specificity of these tests has a negligible impact on the disease dynamics. A false positive test result would mean people are unnecessarily removed from the susceptible population, but the benefit of a reduction in susceptible population is negligibly small. It\\'s also very likely the infection testing would be heavily biased toward symptomatic carriers, where the prevalence of the disease is high so fewer false positives would be expected.\\n\\nTwo evaluations have been conducted. The first using the stated government goal of 100,000 tests per day (left graphs in figure 4 ). It remains unclear whether this aim is feasible, or if this testing capacity would include both forms of tests (antibody and active virus). The second evaluation looks at a very optimistic case where we could conduct as many as 150,000 tests per day (right graphs in figure 4 ). The authors draw no conclusions about the feasibility of achieving these levels. However the authors do wish to encourage caution that with a capacity for testing of the order targeted by the UK government, testing in isolation is not sufficient to allow any rapid cessation of the current social distancing measures without a resurgence of the virus. This caution is irrespective of test performance, even very good tests with a sensitivity of 98%, and effective isolation of cases that have tested positive, the outcome is broadly invariant.\\n\\nThe immunity passport is an idiom describing an approach to the relaxation of the current social distancing measures that focuses heavily on antibody testing. Wide-scale screening for antibodies in the general population promises significant scientific value, and targeted antibody testing is likely to have value for reducing risks to NHS and care-sector staff, and other key workers who will need to have close contact with Covid-19 sufferers. The authors appreciate these other motivations for the development and roll-out of accurate antibody tests. This analysis however focuses on the appropriateness of this approach to relaxing current social distancing measures by mass testing the general population. Antibody testing has been described as a \\'game-changer\\' [25] . Some commentators believe this could have a significant impact on the relaxation of social distancing measures [22] .\\n\\n.

CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. Much of the discussion around antibody testing in the media has focused on the performance and number of these tests. The efficacy of this strategy however is far more dependent on the prevalence of antibodies in the general population. Without wide-scale antibody screening it\\'s impossible to know the prevalence of antibodies in the general population, so there is scientific value in such an endeavour. However, the prevalence is the dominant factor to determine how efficacious antibody screening would be for relaxing social distancing measures.\\n\\nPresumably, only people who test positive for antibodies would be allowed to leave quarantine. The more people in the population with antibodies, the more people will get a true positive, so more people would be correctly allowed to leave quarantine (under the paradigms of an immunity passport).\\n\\nThe danger of such an approach is the false positives. We demonstrate the impact of people reentering the susceptible population who have no immunity. We assume their propensity to contract the infection is the same as those without this the false sense of security a positive test may engender. On an individual basis, and even at the population level, behavioural differences between those with false security from a positive antibody test, versus those who are uncertain about their viral history could be significant. The model parametrisation here does not include this additional confounding effect.\\n\\nTo simulate the prevalence of antibodies in the general population the model is preconditioned with different proportions of the population in the Q S and Q R states. This is analogous to the proportion of people that are currently in quarantine who have either had the virus and developed some immunity, and the proportion of the population who have not contracted the virus and have no immunity. Of course the individuals in these groups do not really know their viral history, and hence would not know which state 8 .

The specificity for each test in these evaluations was fixed to 90%. In figure 6 each column corresponds to a different antibody test specificity as titled. The sensitivity for each test in these evaluation was fixed to 95%. For all model evaluations in figures 5 and 6 we modelled a continuing and constant ability to conduct targeted active virus testing which continued to remove individuals from the infected population. The infection testing continued throughout each model run with a fixed capacity of 10,000 tests per day, similar to the number of unique individuals that are currently being tested.\\n\\nEach of the graphs in the two figures shows the effect of different prevalences of antibodies in the population. To be clear, this is the proportion of the population that has contracted the virus and recovered but are in quarantine. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK Government Chief Scientific Advisor, in the daily press briefing on the 9 April 2020 stated his belief that this prevalence is likely to be less than 10%, possibly much less. The analysis has explored a range for prevalence from 0.1% to 50%. Figure 5 explores the impact of a variation in sensitivity, from a test with 50% sensitivity (i.e no diagnostic value) to tests with a high sensitivity of 98%. It can be seen, considering the top half of the graphs, that the sensitivity of the test has no discernible impact on the number of infections. The prevalence entirely dominates. This is possibly counter intuitive, but as was discussed in section 2.1, even a highly accurate test produces a very large number of false positives when prevalence is low. In this case that would mean a large number of people are allowed to re-enter the population, placing them at risk, with a false sense of security that they have immunity.\\n\\nThe bottom row of figure 5 shows the proportion of the entire population leaving quarantine over a year of employing this policy. At low prevalence there is no benefit to better performing tests. This again may seem obscure to many readers. If you consider the highest prevalence simulation, where 50% of the population have immunity, higher sensitivity tests are of course effective at identifying those who are immune, and gets them back into the community much faster. However this is not the case currently in the UK because, as Sir Patrick stated, the prevalence of antibodies is likely to be very low at least during the lock-down.\\n\\nA more concerning story can be seen when considering the graphs in figure 6 . Now we consider a range of antibody test specificities. Going from 50% (no value in ruling people out) to 98%. When the prevalence is low, a lower specificity of 75% not only leads to an initial large increase in the number of infections, but also, if employed throughout the year would lead to repeated peaks. This is because the active virus testing would still be employed along side the antibody testing. Falsely-diagnosed susceptible people leaving quarantine leads to a sharp rise in the number of infections. As the prevalence of virus in the non-quarantined population increases the active virus testing becomes more effective and subdues the rise in infections because the testing is more targeted on active virus cases. This would be followed by additional waves as further false positive tests for antibodies are observed. The number of people in quarantine with antibodies declines over the length of the simulation, so naturally the prevalence of immunity in the quarantined population declines. As the prevalence declines the N P V of the test declines.\\n\\nWhen we consider the bottom half of figure 6 and look at the impact on the proportion of the population able to leave quarantine, unlike previously, the number of false positives dominates when there is a lower specificity. So there are many more people leaving the quarantine, even when the prevalence is very low (0.1%). This may be desirable to some who favour increasing economic and social activity, but it is of course at the cost of further infections. Decision makers and the public need to be aware of the trade-off being made. The dangers of neglecting uncertainties in medical diagnostic testing are pertinent to this decision [26] , particularly if immunity passports become prominent in the strategy to end the current social distancing measures.\\n\\nAt this point, some form of incremental relaxation of the current government social distancing advice seems highly likely. This could take many forms, it could be an incremental restoration of certain activities such as school openings, permission for the reopening of some businesses, the relaxation of the stay-at-home messaging, etc. Under the parameterisation chosen for this analysis the model is not sensitive to any particular policy change. We consider a variety of rates of phased relaxations to the current quarantine. To model these rates we consider a weekly incremental transition rate from Q S to S, and Q R to R. In figure 7 , three weekly transition rates have been applied: 1%, 5% and 10% of the quarantined population. Whilst in practice the rate is unlikely to be uniform as decision makers would have the ability to update their timetable as the impact of relaxations becomes apparent, it is useful to illustrate the interaction of testing capacity and release rate.\\n\\nThe model simulates these rates of transition for a year, with a sensitivity and specificity of 90% for active virus tests. The specifics of all the runs are detailed in table 2. Figure 7 shows five analyses, with increasing capacity for the active virus tests. In each, the 3 incremental transition rates are applied with\\n\\nInitial Population split σ A τ A β γ Q S S Q I Q I Q R R 0.9 0.9 0.32 0.1 0.95 0.034 0.004 0.01 0.001 0.001 Table 2 : Fixed parameters used for Figure 7 analysis. a range of disease prevalences in the population being tested. The P P V , as discussed in section 2.1, has a greater dependence on the prevalence (at lower values) in the tested population than it does on the sensitivity of the tests, the same is true of the specificity and the N P V .\\n\\nIt is important to notice that higher test capacities cause a higher peak of infections for the 10% quarantine release rate. This has a counterintuitive explanation. When there is the sharpest rise in the susceptible population (i.e., high rate of transition), the virus rapidly infects a large number of people. When these people recover after two weeks they become immune and thus cannot continue the spread of the virus. However, when the infection testing is conducted with a higher capacity up to 120,000 units per day, these tests transition some active viral carriers into quarantine, so the peak is slightly delayed providing more opportunity for those released from quarantine later to be infected, leading to higher peak infections. This continues until the model reaches effective herd immunity after which the number of infected in the population decays very quickly. Having higher testing capacities delays but actually worsens the peak number of infections.\\n\\nAt 10% release rate, up to a capacity of testing of 120,000 these outcomes are insensitive to the prevalence of the disease in the tested population . This analysis indicates that the relatively fast cessation of social distancing measures and stay-home advice would lead to a large resurgence of the virus. Testing capacity of the magnitude stated as the goal of the UK government would not be sufficient to flatten the curve in this scenario.\\n\\nAt the rate of 5% of the population in lock-down released incrementally each week the infection peak is suppressed compared to the 10% rate. The number of infections would remain around this level for a significantly longer period of time, up to 6 months. There is negligible impact of testing below a capacity of 50,000 tests. However if the test capacity were 80,000 tests, at a quarantine release rate of 5% the duration of the elevated levels of infections would be reduced, reducing the length of necessary wide-scale social distancing. This effect is only observed with the more targeted tests, where a prevalence of the disease in the targeted population is over 30%. Any less well targeted testing and the testing would have a negligible impact compared to the untested scenario.\\n\\nThe 1% release rate scenario indicates that a slow release by itself is sufficient to lower peak infections, but extends the duration of elevated infections. The first graph of the top row in figure 7 shows that the slow release rate causes a plateau at a significantly lower number of infections compared to the other release rates. Poorly targeted tested at capacities less than 100,000 show similar consistent levels of infections. However, with a targeted test having a prevalence of 30% or more, the 1% release rate indicates that even with 50,000 tests per day continuous suppression of the infection may be possible.\\n\\nThis analysis does support the assertion that a bad test is worse than no tests, but a good test is only effective in a carefully designed strategy. More is not necessarily better and over estimation of the test accuracy could be extremely detrimental.\\n\\nThis analysis is not a prediction; the numbers used in this analysis are estimates, and therefore, when such policies are devised and implemented this analysis would need to be repeated with more up-to-date numerical values. As such, the authors are not drawing firm conclusions about the absolute necessary capacity of tests. Nor do they wish to make specific statements about the necessary sensitivity or specificity of tests or the recommended rate of release from quarantine. The authors do, however, propose some conclusions that would broadly apply to the present situation, and therefore believe they should be considered by policy makers when designing strategies to tackle COVID-19. Great caution should be exercised in the use of antibody testing. Under the assumption that the proportion of people in the UK who have had the virus is still low, it\\'s unlikely antibody testing at any scale will significantly support the end of lock-down measures. And, the negative consequences of un-targeted antibody screening at the population level could cause more harm than good.\\n\\nAntibody testing, with a high specificity may be very useful on an individual basis, it certainly has scientific value, and could reduce risk for key workers. But any belief that these tests would be useful to relax lock-down measures for the majority of the population is misguided. At best it is a distraction, at worst it could be dangerous.\\n\\nThe incremental relaxation to lock-down measures, with all else equal, would significantly dampen the increase in peak infections, by 1 order of magnitude with a faster relaxation, and 2 orders of magnitude with a slower relaxation.\\n\\nThe capacity for infection screening needs to be significantly increased if it is to be used to relax quarantine measures, but only if it is well targeted, for example through effective contact tracing. Untargeted mass screening would be ineffectual and may prolong the necessary implementation of lock-down measures.\\n\\nOne interpretation of these results is that countries that had mass testing regimes early in the pandemic but had much lower case fatality rates may have been reporting a large number of false positives.\\n\\nThe results of this paper may explain what is being observed in nations such as Singapore as they continue to employ less-targeted mass testing and after a rapid cessation to their lock-down measures are now experiencing a second peak in infections [27] .\\n\\nThis work has been partially funded by the EPSRC IAA exploration award with grant number EP/R511729/1, EPSRC programme grant \"Digital twins for improved dynamic design\", EP/R006768/1, and the EPSRC and ESRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Quantification and Management of Risk and Uncertainty in Complex Systems and Environments, EP/L015927/1 . \\n\\nSIR models offer one approach to explore infection dynamics, and the prevalence of a communicable disease. In the generic SIR model, there are S people susceptible to the illness, I people infected, and R people who are recovered with immunity. The infected people are able to infect susceptible people at rate β and they recover from the disease at rate γ [28] . Once infected persons have recovered from the disease they are unable to become infected again or infect others. This may be because they now have immunity to the disease or because they have unfortunately died. Figure 8 shows a schematic of the generic model formulation, and how people move between the states. Figure 9 demonstrates the typical disease dynamics, the Infected corresponding to the now well known curve that we are trying to flatten. The SIR model has two ways in which the number of new infections falls to zero. Either the number of susceptible people reduces to a point at which the disease can no longer propagate, perhaps because of a vaccine or natural immunity, or the epidemic stops if the basic reproduction rate of the disease falls below 1 due to social distancing or effective viral suppression.\\n\\n.\\n\\n.

For a defined testing strategy, with an active viral test having sensitivity, specificity and capacity of σ A , τ A and C A respectively, an antibody test with sensitivity, specificity and capacity σ B , τ B and C B respectively and a testing prevalence of p, these rates are defined as follows: N A = min (C A , Bin (S + I, ρ)) , (6a) N B = min (C B , Bin (Q S + Q R , φ)) , (6b) T I = min (N A p, Ip) , (6c) T S = min(S, N A − T I ), (6d) At each time step t, the model calculates the number of persons moving between each state in the order defined above. The use of a binomial model was prompted by a desire to incorporate both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty in each movement. The current approach does not make use of epistemic uncertainty, fixing the model parameters σ A , τ A , σ B , τ B , φ, ρ, C A , C B and p. A discrete time model was selected to allow for comparisons against available published data detailing recorded cases and recoveries on a day-by-day basis.\\n\\n', 'Title not Mentioned', 'With growing public concern over the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), significant efforts have been undertaken by global biomedical stakeholders to develop effective diagnostics, vaccines, anti-viral drugs, medical devices, and other therapeutics against this highly infectious and deadly pandemic. While in the past, the traditional randomized clinical trial (RCT) and regulatory approval process often took several years (U.S. Food & Drug Administration, 2018)-longer than the typical duration of an epidemic outbreak (Pronker et al. 2013 )-recently the FDA has responded with actions such as the Breakthrough Devices Program, Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) authority, and Immediately in Effect guidance documents to prevent novel diagnostics and therapeutics from lagging behind the urgent needs of the population. In this paper, we propose adapting yet another tool that the FDA has already been exploring for medical devices (Chaudhuri et al. , 2019 to therapeutics for treating COVID-19 that are currently under development.\\n\\nIn recent years, Bayesian adaptive RCT protocols have been increasingly used to expedite the clinical trial process of potentially transformative therapies for diseases with high mortality rates (Berry, 2015) . Currently, these protocols have mainly been applied within the oncology domain, such as I-SPY for breast cancer (Barker et al., 2009 ) and GBM AGILE for glioblastoma (Alexander et al. 2018) . These studies use Bayesian inference algorithms to greatly reduce the number of patients needed to assess the therapeutic effects of a drug candidate, without lowering the statistical power of the final approval decision, as measured by Type I and II error rates. As a result, therapeutic candidates can progress more quickly through the regulatory process and reach patients faster and at lower cost.\\n\\nFor severe diseases with no curative treatments, such as pancreatic cancer, patients tend to tolerate a higher Type I error of accepting an ineffective therapy in exchange for a lower Type II error of rejecting an effective therapy as well as expedited approvals of potentially effective treatments. Based on this observation, a patient-centered Bayesian protocol was proposed (Isakov et al., 2018; Montazerhodjat et al., 2017) that incorporates patient values into clinical trial design and identify the optimal balance between the possibilities of false positives (Type I error) and false negatives (Type II error). For more severe diseases, this protocol sets a tolerated Type I error rate much larger than the traditional 5% threshold, which leads to higher rates of approvals and expedited approval decisions.\\n\\nHowever, the original Bayesian adaptive RCT framework does not take into account patient risk preferences. To address this gap, developed an adaptive version of the Bayesian patient-centered model that achieves an optimal balance between Type I and Type II error rates, significantly reducing the number of subjects needed in trials to achieve a statistically significant conclusion. A key feature of this model is the time evolution of the loss function of the Bayesian decision algorithm. This mechanism favors the expedited approval of diagnostic or therapeutic candidates that show early positive effects, since patients place a lower value on delayed approval of an effective diagnostic or therapy.\\n\\nThere is a natural but subtle analog to this dilemma in the case of therapeutics for an infectious disease during the course of an epidemic outbreak. Approving an effective therapeutic early will prevent future infections and deaths, while approving it later will save fewer people from infection. On the other hand, approving an ineffective therapeutic early 8 April 2020 © 2020 by Xu, Chaudhuri, Xiao, and Lo\\n\\nPage 2 of 27 All Rights Reserved will not prevent any future casualties. Worse still, it may prevent people from taking adequate precautions against infection, since they will falsely believe that they are safe from the disease after the advent of the ineffective therapy.\\n\\nMoreover, the cost of Type I versus Type II error can differ from therapy to therapy. A novel vaccine that could trigger a significant immune response such as a cytokine storm has a much higher cost of a Type I error than a medical device such as an air filtration system designed to destroy virions through intense ultraviolet light. Therefore, the appropriate statistical threshold for approval should depend on the specific therapy, as well as the circumstances of the current burden of disease.\\n\\nIn this article, we apply the Bayesian adaptive protocol to anti-infective therapeutic development using a loss function that evolves over the course of an epidemic outbreak. We achieve an optimal balance between Type I and Type II errors for therapeutics that treat infectious diseases and identify the optimal time to reach the approval decision based on the accumulation of clinical evidence. Our results show that when the epidemic is more infectious, the necessary sample size of the RCT decreases, while the tolerable Type I error increases. This confirms our earlier intuition that potentially effective therapies that are known to be safe should receive expedited approval when an epidemic is spreading rapidly.\\n\\nThe starting point for our analysis is the Susceptible-Exposure-Infective-Removed (SEIR) epidemic model, which has been applied to model the outbreak of COVID-19 in China in a number of recent studies (Yang et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020 ). The population of N subjects is partitioned into four distinct groups: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), and removed (R). The time evolution of the epidemic is specified by the following group of ordinary differential equations:\\n\\nHere we use the convention that , , , and are the proportions of the susceptible, exposed, infectious and removed populations, respectively, satisfying the conservation constraint for all :\\n\\n100% .\\n\\n(\\n\\nThe parameters , , and denote the average rates of infection, incubation and recovery, respectively, and ∈ 0%, 100% denotes the mortality rate of the epidemic. For example, if 5%, we expect 5% of infected subjects will die from the disease. At time , subjects will have died, and 1 will have recovered.\\n\\nA critical measure of the infectivity of an epidemic is its basic reproduction number, defined as / in the SEIR model. This is the expected number of secondary infections caused by each infected subject in a population with no public health measures (such as quarantine, social-distancing, or vaccination). In addition, to model the impact of governmental nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on containing the spread of the epidemic, we consider a dynamic transmission SEIR model where the infection rate monotonically decreases in time as a result of the NPI. Specifically, we assume that takes the sigmoid functional form:\\n\\nHere and denote the infection rates in the initial and final stages of the epidemic (with ), respectively, denotes the half-life of the decay in infection rate, and the length of the time window when this decay occurred. A larger difference corresponds to more significant reduction of epidemic transmission, a smaller value of corresponds to a speedier decision to enforce the NPI, and a smaller value of corresponds to more strict enforcement of the NPI since decays more rapidly. We calibrate the values 3 and 1.5 based on the estimates of the dynamic transmission rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China from December 2019 to February 2020 (Kucharski et al., 2020) . We consider different values of and to reflect the variability in timing and stringency of NPIs enforced by governments around the globe.\\n\\nTo model the significant variability in mortality rates of COVID-19 for patients in different age groups, we extend this basic model to a multi-group SEIR model, where the population is partitioned into five age groups, (1) below 49, (2) 50 to 59, (3) 60 to 69, (4) 70 to 79, and (5) above 80. We use , , , and to denote the corresponding type in each group (and continue to use , , , and for the total proportion of each type in all groups). The dynamics of the epidemic are specified by the modified ordinary differential equations:\\n\\nHere denotes the contact rate of the susceptible subjects in the th age group with the total infected population of all groups. This contact rate is measured relative to group 1, which we normalize to 1. In the case of COVID-19, although the mortality rate is much higher for senior populations (Onder et al., 2020) , the elderly also tends to have less frequent contact with the infected population outside the household (Walker et al., 2020) .\\n\\nWe solve the differential equations in the multi-group SEIR model using the ODE45 solver in MATLAB 2019a with initial conditions for each age group: The parameter denotes the proportion of the initially infected population, is the ratio of initially exposed and infected subjects, and is the percentage of the th age group in the population. The assumed demographic, contact rate, and mortality rate values are summarized in Table 2 .\\n\\nSimilar to , we develop a Bayesian patient-centered decision model for RCT approval which minimizes the expected loss (or harm) incurred on the patients by optimally balancing the losses of Type I and Type II errors. Here the loss does not refer to financial costs afforded by the patients, but rather the loss in patient value (i.e. how much patients weigh the relative harms of infection and death). We assign the losses per patient of being susceptible, infected, and deceased. Since Bayesian decision thresholds are invariant under the rescaling of the losses, we normalize by setting the loss per patient infection 1 . We then assign the loss per patient death relative to as , and the loss due to susceptibility to the disease as . The parameter values we assume, summarized in Table  1 , are meant to represent one reasonable valuation of the relative losses. However, in practice patient value will differ from one patient group another, especially given the large variability of mortality rate of COVID-19 in different age groups (Onder et al., 2020) . Here we report the main results of optimal sample size and statistical significance (Table 3 and 4) assuming 100. The results for 10 are provided in Supplementary Materials.\\n\\nWe simulate the multi-group SEIR model over a time period of weeks, where is the duration of the epidemic outbreak. Let denote the weekly subject enrollment rate in each arm of the clinical trial. We assume that the value of is known (or well-estimated) at initial time 0 and stays constant during the course of the outbreak. At time ∈ 0, , the Bayesian loss C t of choosing the action under is defined as: 0 do not approve 1 approve 0 (no effect) 0\\n\\nwhere we define the cumulative number of infected patients until time t:\\n\\n.\\n\\nBy design, this loss function penalizes Type I errors early in the epidemic by the susceptible term, . We subtract the base level from since the multi-group SEIR model predicts that subjects will not be infected by the epidemic. A Type I error .

On the other hand, the loss function also penalizes correct approval decisions made at later stages of an epidemic via to the cumulative infected and death terms, and . A correct but delayed approval decision for the therapeutic is less valuable since it will save fewer susceptible people from infection and death. The Bayesian decision model considers the null hypothesis 0 that the anti-infective therapeutic (or vaccine) has no clinical effect, against the alternative hypothesis that it has positive clinical effect with signal-to-noise ratio . We use and to denote the Bayesian prior probabilities of 0 and 1, respectively.\\n\\nThis patient-value model imposes higher losses for incorrect approvals at earlier stages and correct approvals at later stages of an epidemic. Under these constraints, the Bayesian decision algorithm yields the sample size and statistical significance threshold of the RCT that optimally balances Type I and Type II error.\\n\\nWe simulate an epidemic outbreak over a time period of weeks, where is the duration of the outbreak. For an epidemic with higher infectivity, its duration is shorter, which puts more pressure to reach a timely approval decision. To avoid numerical instability, we formally define as the first time when the number of cumulative infected patients reaches 99.9% of total infections predicted by the SEIR model. We assume an age-specific mortality rate at the level of COVID-19 (Onder et al. 2020; World Health Organization, 2020) , and incubation and recovery periods of 7 days each (Yang et al. 2020). These estimated parameters can all be challenged to varying degrees, depending on the specific drugindication pair under consideration and the particular circumstances of the epidemic, but they are meant to be representative for a typical anti-infective therapeutic during the midst of a growing epidemic.\\n\\nWe also assume that it takes 7 days after injection to assess the efficacy of the therapeutic on each subject. We adopt the optimization scheme of Montazerhodjat et al. (2017) to find the optimal Type I and Type II error rates of the non-adaptive Bayesian RCT. To represent typical practice of the pharmaceutical industry, we optimize under the upper bound on the model\\'s power Power 90% (Isakov et al. 2019) . We then use these optimal error rates as our stopping criteria to simulate the sequential decision process of a Bayesian adaptive RCT via Monte Carlo simulation . The simulation results are summarized in Table 3 .\\n\\nWe separate the results into two distinct types of therapeutics-non-vaccine anti-infectives and vaccines-because of the differences in their historical probabilities of success. Vaccine development programs have an estimated PoS of 40% as of 2019Q4 (https://projectalpha.mit.edu) whereas the corresponding figure for non-vaccine antiinfectives is 23% (Wong et al., 2020) .\\n\\n.

For the fixed-sample Bayesian RCT on a non-vaccine anti-infective therapeutic, as increases from 2 to 4 (Rows 1 to 2 of Table 3 ), the optimal sample size of each experimental arm decreases from 242 to 152 and the optimal Type I error rate drastically increases from 7.1% to 17.3% (Figure 1 ), much higher than the traditional 5% threshold. As the epidemic spreads across the population more rapidly, the Bayesian RCT model has greater pressure to expedite the approval process and a much higher tolerance of false positive outcomes.\\n\\nFor the Bayesian adaptive RCT, when the therapeutic is ineffective ( 0), the average sample size required to reject the therapeutic is much smaller than that of the non-adaptive version (Columns 7 and 8 of Table 3 ). Also, the required sample size decreases with the infectivity in both mean and quartiles, yet always achieves Type I error rate below that of the non-adaptive version (Column 11). The adaptive Bayesian decision model is able to reject an ineffective therapeutic with a relatively small sample size and a bounded falsepositive rate.\\n\\nOn the other hand, when the therapeutic is effective ( 1), as increases from 2 to 4, the average sample size required by the Bayesian adaptive RCT decreases from 148 to 78 (Columns 9 and 10 of Table 3 ). The Bayesian adaptive model places more weight on approving an effective therapeutic earlier to prevent future infections when the epidemic is more infectious. Despite the smaller sample size, the model still retains an empirical power above 91.0% for all values of (Column 12). The Bayesian adaptive model simultaneously expedites the approval of an effective therapeutic and retains a bounded false-negative rate. The results are illustrated in Figure 2 .\\n\\nFurthermore, as the proportion of the initially infected population decreases from 0.1% to 0.01% (Rows 4 to 6 of Table 3 ), the optimal sample sizes for non-adaptive and adaptive RCTs both increase, while the optimal Type I error rates decrease. Beginning the clinical trials for a therapeutic during the earlier stages of an epidemic outbreak reduces the need to expedite the approval process in order to contain its future spread. Clinicians and researchers have more time to evaluate the efficacy of a therapeutic and record adverse effects by testing it on a larger number of subjects, which leads to a lower Type I error rate.\\n\\nFinally, when the mortality rate increases from the level of COVID-19 (Onder et al. 2020; World Health Organization, 2020) , to the level of SARS (World Health Organization, 2003) , and further to the level MERS (World Health Organization, 2019), the optimal sample sizes for both non-adaptive and adaptive Bayesian models decrease and the optimal Type I error rates increase (Rows 7 to 12 of Table 3 ). When the epidemic is more lethal, the Bayesian adaptive model requires fewer subjects in the RCT, since both Type I and Type II errors will lead to greater losses due to death by infection. The higher death tolls provides significantly more incentive in the Bayesian adaptive framework to approve the therapeutic in the hopes of saving more people from future infection and death.\\n\\n.

As decreases below 1.7, the optimal Type I error rate increases. The intuition for this result that we define the loss of Type I error as the excess risk of being susceptible to infection , where is the fraction of the population that remains uninfected throughout the epidemic outbreak. When is small, is close to 100% and the excess risk is small compared to the benefit of preventing future deaths. Therefore, when the epidemic is not very infectious, the Bayesian decision model expedites the approval decision. This also confirms the intuition that smaller sample sizes are required in adaptive trials for diseases that affect a small fraction of the population. If we instead define the loss of Type I error as the absolute risk of being susceptible , we find that the optimal Type I error indeed monotonically increases with , as shown in Figure 11 of Supplementary Materials.\\n\\nThe results for the dynamic transmission model with 3, 1.5, 3 weeks and 1 week are summarized in Table 3 . For COVID-19 (rows 3 and 6), we find that the Bayesian optimal sample size and Type I error rate of the dynamic transmission model lie in between the scenarios 2 and 4. This suggests that timely and effective government interventions will protect more subjects from infection and allow more time for the RCT.\\n\\nHowever, for the more fatal SARS and MERS (rows 9 and 12), the dynamic transmission model sets higher optimal Type I error and smaller sample size than 4. This is due to the U-shaped curve of optimal vs. , shown in Figure 1 . When the NPI reduces below a certain threshold, the optimal starts to increase. For highly fatal epidemics, when the government adopts NPIs to protect most of the susceptible population from infection, the regulatory priority should be to expedite potentially effective treatments that can help current patients since the loss of Type I error is much lower than that of the Type II error.\\n\\nIn addition, we investigate the impact of the timing and stringency of NPIs enforced by the government with different values of and . The results are summarized in Table 5 . We find that the optimal Type I error is larger for 3 weeks than 6 weeks. Therefore, if the government adopts well-enforced NPIs early on (such as the lockdown of Wuhan, China) to protect the susceptible population, this will reduce the loss associated with Type I error, leading to expedited approvals of potentially effective therapeutics. Furthermore, the sooner an effective therapeutic is approved, the sooner will NPIs be lifted.\\n\\nWe repeat the above analysis for RCT of vaccines using a prior probability of having an effective vaccine 40% as reported at https://projectalpha.mit.edu for 2019Q4. The simulation results are summarized in Table 4 . Overall, we observe the same pattern in the optimal sample size and Type I error rates on infectivity, mortality, and proportion of initial infections. However, since is higher for vaccines, the Bayesian decision model requires fewer subjects on average in the RCT to ascertain the positive effects of the vaccine, compared to the case of anti-infective therapeutics in Table 3 . We find that vaccines should receive even more expedited evaluation.\\n\\n.

The results are summarized in Supplementary Materials.\\n\\nA natural consequence of using a patient-centered framework for determining the approval threshold is, of course, more false positives-and the potential for a greater number of patients with adverse side-effects-in cases where the burden of disease is high. These false positives can be addressed through more vigilant post-approval surveillance by regulatory agencies and greater requirements for drug and device companies to provide such patientlevel data to the regulator following approval. Failure to provide such data or evidence of an ineffective therapy can be grounds for revoking the approval.\\n\\nHowever, past experience shows that withdrawing an approved drug can be challenging and disruptive for several reasons (Onakpoya, Heneghan, and Aronson, 2016) . Therefore, implementing the patient-centered approach may require creating a new category of temporary approvals for crisis situations involving urgent needs at national or international levels, similar to the FDA\\'s EUA program. Such a program might involve provisional approval of a candidate therapy consisting of a one-or two-year license-depending on the nature of the drug-indication pair-to market the therapy to a pre-specified patient population, no offlabel use of the therapy, and regular monitoring and data reporting to the regulator by the manufacturer and/or patients\\' physicians during the licensing period (Lo, 2017) . At the end of this trial period, one of two outcomes would occur, depending on the accumulated data during this period: (a) the \"urgent needs\" license expires; or (b) the license converts to the traditional regulatory license. Of course, at any point during the trial period, the regulator can terminate the license if the data show that the therapeutic is ineffective and/or unsafe.\\n\\nWhile such a process may impose greater burdens on patients, manufacturers, and regulators, it may still be worthwhile if it brings faster or greater relief to patients facing mortal illnesses and extreme suffering. In this respect, an urgent-needs program may be viewed as a middle ground between a standard clinical trial and an approval, similar in spirit to the adaptive designs of sophisticated clinical trials with master protocols such as I-SPY 2, LUNG-MAP, and GBM-AGILE, in which patient care and clinical investigations are simultaneously accomplished. Also, because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has demonstrated a willingness to cover the cost of certain therapeutics for which evidence is still being generated (see, for example, CMS\\'s \"coverage with evidence\" programs listed at https://go.cms.gov/2v6ZxWm), additional economic incentives may be available to support such temporary licenses.\\n\\n.

Using a simple epidemiological model, we find that the optimal sample size in the clinical trial decreases with the infectivity of the epidemic, measured by the basic reproduction number . At the same time, the optimal Type I error rate increases with . Lower levels of initial infection increase the number of subjects required to verify the therapeutic efficacy of the therapeutic under investigation, while higher levels of mortality increase the optimal sample size. The results confirm our intuition that clinical trials should be expedited and a higher false positive rate should be tolerated when the epidemic spreads more rapidly through the population, has a higher mortality rate, and has already infected a sizable portion of the population at the beginning of the RCT.\\n\\nTo provide transparency for how a patient-centered approach differs from the traditional statistical framework in the anti-infectives context, we used a relatively simple mathematical model of epidemic disease dynamics to estimate the societal loss in an outbreak. More sophisticated epidemiological models can easily be incorporated into our framework at the cost of computational tractability and transparency.\\n\\nOne interesting trade-off to be explored is the difference between COVID-19 vaccine and an anti-viral treatment that can cure an infected patient. While prevention through vaccination is the ultimate solution, a successful treatment for the disease using repurposed drugs that have already been approved for other indications (and whose safety profile has already been established) may be even more valuable, especially if it can be deployed in the nearer term and reduce the growing fear and panic among the general population. In such cases, the approval threshold should clearly reflect these cost/benefit differences.\\n\\nOf course, in practice regulators consider many factors beyond p-values in making its decisions. However, that process is opaque even to industry insiders, and the role of patient preferences is unclear. The proposed patient-centered approach provides a systematic, objective, adaptive, and repeatable framework for explicitly incorporating patient preferences and burden-of-disease data in the therapeutic approval process. This framework also fulfills two mandates for the FDA, one from the fifth authorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) for an enhanced quantitative approach to the benefit-risk assessment of new drugs (U.S FDA, 2013), and the other from Section 3002 of the 21 st Century Cures Act of 2016 requiring the FDA to develop guidelines for patientfocused drug development, which includes collecting patient preference and experience data and explicitly incorporating this information in the drug approval process.\\n\\nWe hope this work will shed further insight into improving the current clinical trial process for infectious disease therapeutics and contribute to the timely development of effective treatments for COVID-19 patients in particular.\\n\\n.

It also includes performing temperature surveillance on individuals who enters and leaves the community and institutions, and conducting medical examination and screening on the febrile. In hard-hit communities, where residents are not allowed to leave their homes, supplies are pre-ordered online and distributed by community managers and volunteers; the fifth is to trace the confirmed and suspected cases, which means mandatorily isolating and treating the confirmed cases, quarantining the suspected cases centralized, and quarantining the contacts centralized or at home; the sixth is to mobilize medical and protective equipment. Each province sends medical and health personnel and mobilizes medical equipment to support Hubei province, distributes or quantitative sales of masks to residents, and requires residents to wear a face mask when they go out; the seventh is to insist on information disclosure. Seventh, insist on the disclosure of information. From the central government to the local area, regular reports of confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 are made daily, and epidemiological follow-up investigation reports are released, including their whereabouts and all possible contacts; the eighth is to quarantine individuals from other cities for 14 days. Since March 14, some areas require overseas entrants to be conducted centralized quarantine for 14 days. January 24 to February 2 is the Chinese Spring Festival holiday. However, after the end of the holiday, enterprises were not allowed to operate. Most provinces stipulated that production operations could only be carried out after February 10 with the approval of the government.\\n\\nThey also required that people from other cities and provinces must provide health certificates and be quarantined for 14 days. Specifically, individuals who came from hardest-hit area should be quarantined at a designated location for 14 days, as for those from non-hardest-hit area, they also should be quarantined at home 14 days. After March 20, some provinces will only gradually relax control if there are no new confirmed cases for several consecutive days.\\n\\nThe stringent control measures in China quickly brought the epidemic under control. By February 18, the number of diagnosed cases in Wuhan reached a peak of 38,020, and in other regions reached a peak of 13,886 on February 14, then the number of new cases began to gradually decrease. By March 18, for the first time, there were no new cases within China, and the stock of diagnosed cases fell to 7,263. The prevention and control of COVID-19 have mainly shifted to controlling imported cases overseas. However, of the 32 province-level administrative regions in mainland China, 6 have fewer than 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 13 were between 100 -500 cases and only 5 have more than 1,000 cases, namely Hubei, Guangdong, Henan, Zhejiang, and Hunan. There were no COVID-19 cases in 19 of 334 prefecture-level administrative regions across the country, and more than a third of the 2,851 county-level administrative regions did not occur. In other words, the epidemic in more than half of the country is very mild, while Tibet has only one imported case, but they all have adopted a Level Ⅰ emergency response without exception. The Level Ⅰ emergency response means a suspension of economic activity in all regions of the country, with costs that are difficult to estimate. One percentage reduction in China\\'s GDP growth rate means a loss of more than 830 billion yuan. At the same time, strict measures to control COVID-19 epidemic will cause economic depression and rising unemployment, as well as increase the number of abnormal death (suicide and malnutrition, insufficient medical care, etc.). Therefore, when the epidemic in China is effectively controlled, it is necessary to reflect on whether it is necessary to implement comprehensive control in regions where there are no infected cases? How much prevention and control is needed to be effective in regions with different epidemic severity?\\n\\nThe main contributions of this article are as follows: First, in response to the control measures of COVID-19 in China, we attempt to use statistical methods to distinguish which measures are effective in different regions, which has rarely been discussed in epidemiology in the past; Second, regarding the differences between measures taken by China in and all the measures in other countries in the past few decades, we take the traffic control measure, the most comprehensive and severe that have not been available in the past few decades, as an independent explanatory variable, trying to analyze which areas need to be adopted. Third, this paper incorporates the proposed effective distance into the model for regression, breaking through the past practice of estimating the scale of epidemic spread based on geographical distance. Fourth, this paper uses Python and other big data mining methods to mine and sort out the prevention and control measures adopted in China and the time taken, as well as the Baidu Search Index \"COVID-19\", \"the correct wearing of masks\", \"Zhong Nanshan\" to represent information dissemination, public awareness of protection and Confidence in fighting the epidemic.\\n\\nWith the progress of globalization, emerging infectious diseases continue to occur and are more likely to cause a global pandemic. Most of them originate from animals. According to statistics, zoonoses account for up to 60.3% of the new infectious diseases, of which 71.8% originate in wildlife (Jones et. al., 2008) . The situation of prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases is very serious (Han et al., 2016) . Since the 21st century, emerging infectious (Zheng et al., 2019) , which have posed a serious threat to human life and health and socio-economic development. There are three stages in the pandemic zoonoses emergence: the first stage is the pre-emergence, under which the pathogen is transmitted between their animal reservoirs. The second stage is localized emergence, during which self-limiting spill events or large-scale spills can lead to the person-to-person transmission for a few pathogen generations.\\n\\nThe third stage was manifested by widespread and global pandemics. In the first stage, it\\'s not easy for the prevention and control departments in the government to recognize the characteristics of the epidemic, and they do not understand the infectivity and transmission of the pathogens. Emergency decision-making is a complex process, which means decisionmakers must analyze a large amount of uncertain information in a short period of time, and make effective decisions to deal with crises timely. This is an extremely difficult process.\\n\\nMissing that stage, it can form a \"butterfly effect\", which causes a huge impact (Morse et al., 2012) .\\n\\nSome literature studies the method that the medical staff treats emerging infectious diseases to reduce or avoid transmission. Koenig (2015) proposed the 3I tool, namely Identify-Isolate-Inform, which is considered to be the normative process for medical staff to treat emerging infectious diseases. The 3I tool has been modified for the prevention and control of infectious diseases such as MERS, measles, Zika virus, mumps, and hepatitis A, and has achieved good results. Triage is an important part of early detection of patients with infectious diseases, effective prevention of the spread of infectious diseases, and better protection of medical staff (Kisting et al., 2012) . Medical staff must have a sufficient understanding of emerging infectious diseases. When encountering suspected patients, it\\'s necessary to ask for medical history in time, to identify potential patients as early as possible, and to make isolation and protection. If a person is suspected to be infected, isolation is required, including the transfer of the patient to another designated place for treatment or direct placement of the patient into an isolation ward. Isolation is an important measure, but there are differences between isolation and quarantine. Quarantine refers to the separation of individuals who may have been exposed to an infectious disease or pathogens but still healthy from those who are healthy and have not been exposed (Chea et al., 2014) . In other words, quarantine is to conduct observation on healthy people who may have been exposed to infectious diseases and may spread the disease to others to determine whether they are truly infected. The concept of observation originated from \"border screening\" (Selvey et al., 2015) . It was originally used for the entry and exit ports, and then expanded the concept to refer to measures taken by people who may be exposed to the disease before symptoms are identified, which are quarantine measures and have no place limitations. For example, people who do not need to be hospitalized can be quarantined at home while being assessed for MERS infection Koenig et al., 2017) . During the observation, once symptoms are identified and the infection is confirmed, quarantine should be switched to isolation. Diseases listed for quarantine must be diseases that pose a serious threat to public health, such as cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fever, SARS, and influenza which may cause a pandemic (Koenig, 2012) .\\n\\nMeasures to be taken is determined according to the quarantine and isolation decision tree, and a certain risk-benefit analysis is required. If the symptoms are not contagious before onset, the travel and social distance will not be limited, but necessary disease surveillance should be carried out to determine whether the intervention of public health agencies is needed to ensure the effectiveness of the latent disease surveillance based on the monitoring effect. Different public health measures need to be selected based on the disease to which the individual assessed is exposed. On the other hand, the difference transmission can significantly affect the speed of disease spreading and the choice of personal protective equipment (PPE). At the same time, legal basis, jurisdiction, impact on mental health and the potential negative consequences of restrictions on human rights and free actions need to be considered. The scientific significance of quarantine lies in the fact that quarantined disease is likely to spread during the incubation period to minimize the probability of infectious disease outbreaks (Barbisch et al., 2015) . The third step of the 3I tool is to promptly report to the infection control department of hospitals, superior supervisors, and law enforcement departments based on the location of the identified and confirmed patient.\\n\\nAnother part of the literature assesses the effectiveness and the scope of application of public health policies. Rothstein & Talbott (2007) found that to make quarantine to be the most effective measure for limiting the spread of infection, compliance with quarantine regulations should be encouraged, that is, providing job security and income replacement. Wang et al. (2012) found that In the case of short reaction time, intra-population, such as patient isolation, are more effective than inter-population such as travel restrictions. Jefferson (2008) pandemic influenza (H1N1) and found those were effective to some extent. Rashid (2015) researched the public health policy of the 2009 pandemic influenza and concluded that the school closure, whether positive or passive, seemed to be moderately effective and acceptable in reducing the spread of influenza and delaying the peak of the epidemic, but it is related to high expenses of secondary school. Voluntary isolation and quarantine at home are also effective and acceptable measures, but it takes the risk of intra-household transmission from index cases to contacts. Workplace-related interventions, such as work closure and work at home, are also moderately effective and acceptable, but it may have negatively impact on economy. Internal mobility restriction is only effective when extremely high restrictions (50% of travel) are imposed and mass gatherings which happened within 10 days before the epidemic peak is likely to increase the risk of transmission of influenzas. Rothstein (2015) compared the effectiveness of public health policies to intervene with infectious diseases, among which quarantine is one of the most aggressive and controversial measures that public health officials can take when trying to control an outbreak. Serious legal and ethical concerns have been raised because of restrictions on the movement of potentially large numbers of people (Fidler et al., 2007) . During the SARS epidemic in 2003, quarantine was widely used in several Asian countries and Canada, and it played a role in ending the epidemic. Similarly, during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, social distancing measures, including quarantine, had become a major containment strategy. The paradox of quarantine and other social distancing measures is that they may effectively resist the outbreak of disease, but the scope of application is too wide, leading to various social hazards, including economic disruption, physical isolation and even violence. Quarantine is the first public health tool to control infectious diseases and remains a legitimate and valuable public health strategy because it has a significant impact on civil liberties, economic activity and social cohesion, so officials must be extra careful about the possibility of abusing quarantine authority (Rothstein, 2015) .\\n\\nHuremović (2019) analyzed and compared the clear definitions and scope of common public health policies, such as isolation, quarantine, shelter-in-place, cordon sanitaire, protective sequestration, and social distancing. Isolation is to restrict the persons who have an infectious disease in a specified geographical area, separating them from healthy people and those who have not been exposed. Different from isolation, quarantine is to separate those who are still healthy but possibly exposed to an infective agent from those who are healthy but have not been exposed, which is a restriction on the movement or communication of persons or the transport of goods in order to prevent the spread of disease (Gostin & Wiley, 2016) . Shelter-inplace (SIP) is a variant of quarantine, in which individuals are not restricted at a designated location, but at where they were at the time (e.g. Family). Cordon sanitaire refers to restricting activities of the individual in a larger and more defined geographic area (such as a community).\\n\\nThe \"Cordon sanitaire\" may be considered a reasonable and useful measure in which: (1) the infection is highly virulent (infectious and possibly cause disease); (2) the mortality rate is extremely high;(3) treatment is not available or difficult to conduct;(4) there is no vaccine or other method to immunize a large number of people.

Comparing with quarantining at a designated place, the advantage of cordon sanitaire is that it tends to keep the community intact, including its basic resources, businesses, and infrastructure. A method that is the opposite of it is called protective sequestration, which means that unaffected communities separate themselves from the outside until there is no risk of an outbreak. Social distancing is a voluntary, recommended restriction on physical contacts, such as staying at home and avoiding public places and activities. Some less drastic, but quite effective and more frequently used measures of social distancing include canceling mass gatherings, school, and workplace closures, travel restrictions, etc. Wilder-Smith (2020) believed that SARS-CoV has now been eliminated, indicating that we can completely stop this epidemic and interrupt person-to-person transmission. In the absence of vaccines and antivirals, only strict implementation of traditional public health measures made this remarkable achievement possible. In the early stages, isolating patients is particularly effective in interrupting the spread of infectious diseases. Since the infected can spread before he is symptomatic, isolation is often too late to prevent transmission and contain the pandemic. Quarantine is one of the oldest and most effective tools for controlling outbreaks of infectious diseases (Cetron & Landwirth, 2005) , which possibly apply at the individual or group level and usually involves restrictions on houses or designated facilities. Social distancing aims to reduce interactions between people in the wider community, where individuals may be contagious but have not yet been identified and therefore have not been isolated. Social distancing is particularly useful where community transmission is considered to be occurring, but the links between cases are unclear, or where restrictions on the known contacts are not considered sufficient to prevent further spread. Social distancing includes closing schools or office buildings, suspending public markets, and canceling gathering. If these measures are considered inadequate, then a community-wide containment is likely to be required. A community-wide containment is an intervention that applies to an entire community, city, or region, aiming to reduce physical contact between people. Implementing a community-wide containment requires close partnerships and cooperation with law enforcement agencies at the local and state levels, and inspection stations are usually established, and legal penalties may be required if there is a violation.\\n\\nSome scholars studied the effects of travel restrictions. Chong & Zee (2012) found that All rights reserved.

As for air travel, it\\'s necessary to target at the main route to the source of influenza, and if 99% air travel restriction is implemented, the peak of the epidemic will be postponed for up to two weeks. Mao (2013) believed that it is not cost-effective to use travel restriction alone, but if 50% of travel restrictions are implemented, combined with antiviral prevention and workplace closure, it is the best strategy. For large urbanized areas, closing the affected workplaces can be an effective and cost-saving strategy to reduce flu outbreaks and it is also the most cost-effective. Folayan & Brown (2015) found that in order to control Ebola, more than 50 countries have issued travel restrictions on affected countries. However, travel restrictions have made it more difficult to tackle the disease, which is not a solution to contain Ebola, because it has become more difficult to deliver supplies, equipment and humanitarian assistance to the affected areas.\\n\\nWhen a suspected traveler from West Africa who are symptomatic is quarantined, the isolation facilities must be optimal, which means providing physical, social and psychological support for all persons quarantined and quality personal protective equipment must be provided for health care providers Although there are lots of searches on public health policies to deal with infectious diseases. However, the prevention and control measures against COVID-19 taken in China are unprecedented, which have been beyond the scope of study in existing literature, such as implementing traffic restrictions across the country and closing communities on a large scale. Therefore, it is still necessary to classify the prevention and control measures of China and study which measures are more effective in different regions.\\n\\nThe outbreak of infectious diseases is a complex process of spreading that occurs in a population. There is a long history of modeling infectious disease epidemics (Anderson et al., 1992) , and various modeling specifications have been developed. Kermark & Mckendrick (1927) proposed the classic SIR model, which is a compartmental model. In the SIR model, it is assumed that each individual is the same, the population is homogeneous mixing, the contact is instant and independent of history, infection rate, recovery rate is constant. Individuals in the same state form a compartment, and as the state changes, they move among the compartment.\\n\\nWith the growth of urban population and the development of transportation networks, social mobility has increased, and the spatial expansion of infectious diseases has shown a new pattern, especially when people move among different regions, the spread of the epidemic is common.\\n\\nUnderstanding the impact of population flow patterns on the prevalence of infectious diseases has attracted considerable attention (Gonzalez et al., 2008) , and a meta-population model derived from ecology has been applied in the field of the epidemic. With the rise of complexity science, the micro-modeling specification has been developed and combined with social networks, a network-based micro-individual modeling method has been proposed, which provides a new approach to understand the spread of infectious diseases. These models enable epidemiologists and health authorities to understand the transmission process, predict its impact on healthy populations, and assess the effectiveness of different mitigation and prevention strategies. But, in any case, the epidemic of infectious diseases is inseparable from two key factors, namely, person-to-person contact and population mobility. When infectious disease outbreaks, various countries adopt public health intervention policies, in which one is to control human contacts, such as isolation, quarantine, and social distancing; the other is to control population mobility, such as travel restrictions.\\n\\nThe factors affecting the spread of the epidemic are extremely complex, which is closely related to the carrier, environment, weather, the contact and so on. If a city is abstracted into a node beyond the scale of micro-individuals, the population flow between cities is the key factor affecting the scale of virus transmission among cities, which is related to urban density and transportation. The meta-population model is a commonly used model for analyzing the spread of epidemics, which nodes are used to represent the city, and the linings are used to represent the traffic between cities, such as the plane, high-speed rail, bus and so on. Within each node, a certain number of people are set. Colizza et al. (2007) used a meta-population model to characterize human behavior on a global scale. They found that a large-scale epidemic would only erupt when the population density exceeded a certain threshold. When the scale of the network is infinite, a few large nodes (namely, important cities) in the network will cause an epidemic to outbreak globally. Regarding transportation, Brockmann & Helbing (2013) found that the spread of disease is closely related to the \"effective distance\" between cities rather than geographical distance. If the probabilistically motivated effective distance is used instead of All rights reserved.

It can also reliably predict the arrival time of the disease, and even if epidemiological parameters are unknown, we can still get the relative arrival times and the spatial origin of the propagation process by the approach.\\n\\nThe effective distance is defined as the best mode of transportation between two cities, depending on the probabilistic traffic flow. Assuming that mn p is the conditional probability of the connectivity matrix P , mn \\n\\nWhere, \\uf07a is the human intervention factor of public health policy, \\uf068 is the minimum intensity of intervention, 0 t is the time point of human intervention, m t is the point at which and public health policy intervention. Any public health policy intervention requires costs, and the cost of different interventions varies. In this paper, the various measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID -19 in China are divided into two categories: One is traffic control, which not only affects the movement of people across regions and even across the country, but also affects the transportation of goods. The price of this is to force companies and other institutions to stop operations, which is at huge cost. Another is social distancing, including closure of public places in the city, community containment, isolation of the infected, and quarantine of the suspected, which affects the operation of some urban institutions, and the cost is less than the traffic control. Based on the mechanism analyzed above and the classification of prevention and control measures against COVID-19, we then propose the hypothesis: traffic control and social distancing can quickly contain the spreads of COVID-19 epidemic, but they perform different effect in various regions.\\n\\nAccording to National Public Health Emergency Preparedness of China, the main body launching the first-level response is the provincial government, the measures and time adopted by different regions are not the same, and the intensity of implementation also varies from city to city, which provides a good condition for the research in this article.\\n\\nAccording to the classification of prevention and control measures of COVID -19 in China, the baseline estimation strategy is as follows: = + 1 + 2 + + + +\\n\\nWhere, is the is the actual cumulative case growth rate of city i in year t. Given that average incubation period of COVID-19 is 5.2 days , we use the 5th lead of the reported cumulative case growth rate to proxy the actual cumulative case growth rate.\\n\\nis the main explanatory variable，namely traffic control and social distancing. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\n\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046110 doi: medRxiv preprint epidemic. t is time trend， is a region fixed effect to control the characteristics of provinces constant over time, is a time fixed effect to control to control the time factors that do not vary from individual to individual.\\n\\nTraffic control and social distancing in each city are classified and scored according to the preventive and control measures taken by prefecture-level administrative regions in China.\\n\\nThere are divided into 15 items (see Table 1 ), each with a score of 1. Scoring starts until the measure is canceled. For example, on January 21, Shanghai began to implement \"quarantining the contacts for 14 days.\" Since this measure is under \"social distancing\", then the score of social distancing in Shanghai from January 21 was 1. On January 24, Shanghai began to implement \"closing part of the indoor urban public places\", since this measure is also under \"social distancing\", then \"social distancing\" in Shanghai will be added another 1 point since January 24, and so on, and finally, the points for traffic control and social distancing will be added up. \\n\\nAs to the data used in this paper, the specific content and implementation time of the prevention and control measures came from the information or announcements issued by the prevention and control headquarters of the prefecture-level administrative districts; the cumulative confirmed case of came from the official release of the National Health and Health All rights reserved.

In addition, the coefficient of social distancing is larger, indicating that the effect of social distancing measures are better than that of traffic control.

At the same time, the places with severe epidemic situation are more inclined to take more vigorous prevention and control measures, that is to say, the development of the epidemic situation will also reversely affect the local prevention and control efforts, so there is a problem of reverse causality. In order to address the endogenous problems caused by missing variables and reverse causality, we use the instrumental variable approach to re-estimate. The selection of instrument variables needs to meet two requirements: the first is that there is a significant relationship between the instrumental variables and the endogenous explanatory variables; and the second is that the instrument variable must be exogenous. We take the 1st lag of the explanatory variable as a instrument variable, and adopt the two stage least squares method (2SLS) and the generalized method of moment (GMM) to estimate it. Table 6 reports the estimated results of the instrumental variable approach. We can say that there is no obvious change in the sign and significance of the coefficients. The results of the instrumental variables approach are consistent with the baseline regression, indicating that the conclusion is still valid after considering endogeneity. Both the traffic control and social distancing have been effective in controlling the epidemic.

The results show that the interaction term is significantly negative and has the same sign as the main explanatory variable, that is, the two measures show a complementary relationship, which implies that the combined effect of the two types of measures can more effectively prevent the further spread of the epidemic. \\n\\nIn order to further explore the regional heterogeneity of effect of the measures, we divide the sample into three groups: high, medium, and low according to the epidemic control capacity of the city (GDP per capita) and difficulty of epidemic control (population size). The subsample results are reported in Table 8 . Panel A presents the results of subsample divided according to per capita GDP, and panel B presents the results subsample divided according to population size. We find that social distancing measures are effective in cities with high or low GDP; However, traffic control measures are more effective in regions with high GDP, the coefficient significance decreases successively in regions with medium and low GDP. The effect of traffic control measures is not ideal in regions with lower GDP. According to the section 2, we know that although traffic control measures effectively restrict the flow of population, it also makes it difficult to deliver supplies equipment and humanitarian aid to the affected areas, which controlling the spread of the epidemic while also increasing the difficulty of responding to the outbreak, so for cities of which control ability is originally lower (low GDP per capita), the practice of traffic control can\\'t obtain a good effect.\\n\\nPanel B presents the results of subsample divided according to population size.

Measures, whether traffic control or social distancing, are aiming to reduce physical contact between people, and in cities with smaller populations, the contact there is already less than in high-density cities, so the effects of those measures fail in low-population cities. In short, the effects of the two measures are not the same in different regions, which depending on conditions of the city, and the implementation of prevention and control measures will incur huge social and economic costs, especially in the outbreak of COVID-19, in order to control the spread of the disease, many cities across the country have implemented strict prevention and control measures such as \"lockdown\" the city. While controlling the epidemic, they have also increased social and economic burdens. Therefore, when formulating an epidemic prevention and control policy, full consideration should be given to the local situation, implementing policies according to the city and achieving precise epidemic prevention. \\n\\nThe effective control of the epidemic depends not only on the selection of prevention and control measures of the authority but also on the performance of the public. Therefore, in this section, we further use Baidu Search Index to explore the influence of the public\\'s access to information, protection awareness, and public confidence on the implementation effect of traffic control and social distancing measures. Fast and effective information dissemination can greatly reduce the information asymmetry of the public and to raise public awareness of the epidemic. We use the Baidu search index of \"COVID-19\" to characterize the degree of information spread among the public. A higher search index means that the public has learned about the novel coronavirus earlier and paid more attention to it; the public\\'s protection awareness and positive attitude will allow them to better carry out the measures, which can absolutely improve the effectiveness of policy implementation. Here, we use the Baidu search index of \"the correct way of wearing a mask\" to characterize protection awareness of the public.\\n\\nA higher search index indicates that people have a better sense of protection; we use Baidu search index of \"Zhong Nanshan\" to characterize people\\'s confidence about fighting the epidemic A high search index indicates that the public has more confidence to fight the epidemic, and it is even more convinced that the epidemic problem will be overcome.\\n\\nWe divide these three indexes into high, medium, and low, respectively, generate dummy variables, and construct the interaction terms between dummy variables and the measures. The results are shown in Table 9 .

It can be seen that except for column (2) in Panel C, whether it is traffic control or social distancing measures, the coefficient of the interaction with high information dissemination (information_H), high protection awareness (awareness_H), and high public confidence (emotion_H) is significantly negative, that is, traffic control and social distancing measures have played a better role in cities with better information dissemination, high protection of the public,and strong confidence in epidemic prevention. It emphasizes the importance of paying attention to the public. While adopting traffic control and social distancing measures, the government should also increase the transparency of information disclosure, improve protection awareness of the public, and properly channel the public sentiment, strengthening public confidence. \\n\\nThe conclusions of this article are: ① In the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic, traffic control and social distancing measures have played a very good role in controlling the spread of the epidemic. Nationwide, the effect of social distancing is better than traffic control. ② The two measures are complementary, and their combined effect will play a better role in epidemic prevention; ③ Traffic control and social distancing do not work everywhere. Traffic control only paly a role in cities with large GDP and population size, but not in cities with low GDP population size; In cities with lower population size, social distancing becomes inoperative. ④ The rapid and accurate transmission of information, a higher protection awareness of the public, and a stronger confidence of residents in epidemic prevention can promote the realization of the measure effects.\\n\\nThe conclusions above have important implications for public health policy. Considering the complementary relationship between the two measures, they should be coordinated with each other when making policies. However, considering the regional heterogeneity of their effect, it is necessary to formulate measures according to the city\\'s own situation, achieving precise epidemic prevention, and the need for such a strict measure as \"lockdown\" the city should be carefully weighed; considering the promotion of better information dissemination, high protection awareness and strong public confidence on the effect of the measures, we should increase the transparency of information, improve protection awareness of the public, guide All rights reserved.

Severe traffic control completely blocked the flow of people and materials, which to some extent made it difficult for the timely replenishment of basic living needs. Social distancing measures such as closing communities and public places inevitably exacerbated the panic among the people and adversely affected the development of their mental health. Therefore, when actively taking prevention and control measures, we must also fully consider the possible negative impacts, reasonably grasp the implementation of the measures, and take supporting remedial measures to minimize the side effects of epidemic prevention and control.\\n\\n', 'Which Measures are Effective in Containing COVID-19? --Empirical Research Based on Prevention and Control Cases in China', 'Background: The current novel coronavirus outbreak, COVID-19, has spread to 28 countries and territories with tens of thousands infected and thousands of deaths (1) .

We found that the public trusted the CDC director to lead the COVID-19 response with trust in the public health/scientific leadership being high. Responsive, open, and respectful communication with the US population by these agencies may improve public health compliance and safety. 3 Furthermore, although participants reported relatively low risk perception, many supported restrictive policies for infection prevention. A portion of the sample also supported temporary discrimination based on someone\\'s country of origin. These responses are concerning, and preemptive targeted messaging by the public health agencies is required to ensure a compassionate response to this outbreak. Our findings may be influenced by possible selection bias because participants needed a CloudResearch account and access to smartphone/computer to participate. However, our sample was fairly representative of the general adult US population. A weighted analysis based on age and gender demonstrate that our results are generalizable to national population ( Table 2) .

Given the speed at which the virus can infect populations and the severity of the resulting symptoms, it represents a significant and unprecedented challenge for many healthcare services; and one with which even the most developed countries have struggled to cope (Instituto Superiore Di Sanita, 2020).\\n\\nManaging a co-ordinated response to pandemics such as COVID-19 is critical. Unchecked, with a basic reproduction rate (R0) estimated at between 2 and 3 (Ferguson et al, 2020 and an estimated 4.4% of those infected requiring hospitalisation (Ferguson et al, 2020) , the virus can propagate rapidly through a population , leading to peaks in demand for hospital care which are simply not possible to match with existing or otherwise available capacity (Ferguson et al, 2020 , Instituto Superiore Di Sanita, 2020 . If, at such times, patients are unable to access the bedded care required then otherwise-avoidable death is likely to result (White & Lo, 2020) . The likelihood of this is particularly heightened when intensive care beds are required, since the necessary invasive ventilation and organ support cannot readily or safely be delivered in other settings (Ñamendys-Silva, 2020) . Early case fatality rates from Wuhan would not be expected to appreciate these capacitydependent deaths (i.e. deaths that can be attributed to a patient unable to access the care they need due to lack of available capacity), since drastic efforts were taken by authorities to avoid health services becoming overwhelmed, in enforcing restrictions on movement and rapidly upscaling capacity through the building of two new hospitals (Khan et al, 2020) . Without improved treatment options, there is little that can be done to reduce COVID-19 deaths occurring when the patient has otherwise been cared for in the most appropriate hospital setting, and so planners should focus on keeping to a minimum the capacity-dependent deaths that are within their influence. That is, efforts should be made to ensure the right level of care is available to patients at the right time.\\n\\nThe principal levers to reduce capacity-dependent deaths relate to managing the demand for and supply of healthcare resources. On the demand side, in absence of the means to treat or prevent disease, the slowing down of cases requiring hospitalisation using measures such as school closures and social distancing can reduce peak excess demand, the so-called \"flattening the curve\" (Anderson et al, 2020) . On the supply side, efforts to expand the capacity of medical and ventilated beds can increase the effective operating throughput, meaning more COVID-19 patients could be admitted and fewer would be rejected with either no care or care in a sub-optimal setting, resulting in increased chance of death.\\n\\nThe ability to use a mathematical or computer model to experiment with \"what if\" scenarios involving these levers is crucial to planners on the ground, in ensuring deaths over the course of the pandemic can be kept at a minimum. Public health authorities need to know what effect their policies on social distancing, home isolation and school closures (i.e. policies to reduce the effective R0) can have on decreasing or changing the shape over time of demand and, in turn, capacity-dependent deaths. Healthcare service planners and managers need to be cognisant of the likely benefits of their options around the flexing of bedded capacity, especially regarding the allocation between acute and intensive care beds (where the substantial efforts involved in increasing the latter must be well justified). With an appropriate model and accompanying software tool, the effect of these scenarios can be projected and used to make better informed strategic decisions when planning the response to a COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nThere has been much interest in the quantitative and mathematical modelling of COVID-19 for purposes of epidemiological forecasting (Ferguson et al, 2020 , Kucharski, 2020 , Roosa et al, 2020 , risk prediction (Vihinen, 2020) , and health system vulnerability (Gilbert et al, 2020) . However, to the best of the authors\\' knowledge there has been no explicit modelling of capacity-dependent deaths based on predicted demand. While Ferguson et al (2020) provide a detailed model of demand and the resulting deaths under various mitigation strategies, their work assumes a fixed mortality rate that is not dependent on the available capacity of the healthcare system. The modelling in this paper addresses this limitation by predicting the excess mortality resulting from demand exceeding intensive care capacity under several mitigation scenarios.\\n\\nComputer simulations of patient flow, demand and capacity have been used extensively to inform decision-making in healthcare (Fone et al, 2003 , Griffiths et al, 2013 , Mohiuddin et al, 2017 , Wood & Murch, 2019 . This is especially true for the stochastic, discrete-event approach to simulation, as it is particularly suited to situations where entities (e.g. patients) \"compete\" for limited resources such as hospital beds and operating room time (Pitt et al, 2016) . Many simulation studies that have tackled questions around demand and capacity in healthcare, both under typical health system conditions (for example Bagust et al, 1999 , Demir et al, 2015 and in periods of increased pressure such as mass casualty events (Glasgow et al, 2018) and winter bed crises (Vasilakis & El-Darzi, 2001 , Wood, 2019 . Specifically in the context of intensive care, simulation studies have addressed bed requirements by using the system dynamics simulation approach to evaluate different management policies (Mahmoudian-Dehkrodi & Sadat, 2016) , and applying analytical queuing models and simulations to the management of patient flow (Kim et al, 1999 , Griffiths et al, 2010 . This paper reports on the development and application of a purpose-built computer simulation model and accompanying easy-to-use open source software, designed for evaluating scenarios to mitigate capacity-dependent deaths from a COVID-19 (or other) pandemic. It should be noted that capacityindependent deaths, occurring when patients are cared for in the most appropriate setting, are out of scope of this study. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Development of the model and implementation is covered in Section 2 alongside data requirements for model parameterisation and the scenarios considered for experimenting with the model. Illustrative results, on application to an intensive care unit in a large teaching hospital in England, are presented in Section 3. Finally, Section 4 contains a discussion on limitations, practical application, and further uses of the model and tool.\\n\\nThe COVID-19 hospital admission process is modelled as a multi-channel queuing system operating with loss. That is, patients requiring hospitalisation are rejected if there is no available service channel (bed). In Kendall\\'s notation (Kendall, 1953) this is an ( ) | | | queuing system: that is, in turn, a time-inhomogeneous Poisson arrivals process representing the epidemic curve for cases requiring hospitalisation; a general service distribution approximating patient length of stay in hospital; C service channels; and a total system capacity of C patients, i.e. no space for waiting. For rejected admissions (lost arrivals), death occurs with probability and survival with probability 1 − . The model can be applied in the context of general acute beds or intensive care beds, assuming the parameters are calibrated accordingly. Implementation of this model is through the iterative three-phased method of discrete event simulation (Pidd, 1998) . In the case of this study, the types of simulation event consist of: a. Arrival of patient requiring hospital admission (unconditional event) b. Patient admitted (conditional event) c. Patient discharged (unconditional event) d. Patient admission rejected and patient died (conditional event) e. Patient admission rejected and patient survived (conditional event)\\n\\nIt should be noted that event type c includes the quite substantial potential (e.g. 61.5% of patients admitted to ICU had died within 28 days, Yang et al, 2020) for patients to die within hospital. This should be considered a capacity-independent death, and thus it is not within scope of this paper.\\n\\nThe basis of the three-phased approach is in maintaining a calendar of unconditional events. The first phase is to step to the next chronological event in the calendar. This could be arrival or discharge (i.e.\\n\\n. CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\n\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050898 doi: medRxiv preprint event type a or c as above). In the second phase this event is executed. The third phase sees any associated conditional event also executed. So, for example, if a patient arrives (event type a) and there is an available service channel (e.g. a free bed) then the conditional event is that the patient is admitted (event type b) and the bed is flagged as unavailable. If, instead, there is no available service channel then their admission is rejected and he or she either dies (event type d) or ultimately survives (event type e).\\n\\nAs the simulated events progress with each iteration, it is necessary to capture the state of the system over time. This keeps the event calendar up-to-date. For instance, if one of the events within an iteration involves a patient entering service (event type b) then the time at which they are discharged (sampled from the given length of stay distribution) is recorded in the calendar, as a future unconditional event (of type c). Capturing the state of the system is also necessary in the generation of performance measures of interest, such as occupancy levels and patient outcomes.\\n\\nDuring the simulation, events are iterated in line with the three-phased method until some terminating criterion is met. Here, this is given by the time at which some outcome has been reached for all simulated admissions for the given epidemic curve (for cases requiring hospitalisation), i.e. each sought admission has been either rejected or admitted and discharged (event types c-e). In other words, and given the time-inhomogeneous nature of the epidemic curve, this is a transient simulation model. As such, and in contrast to simulation models exploring steady-state behaviour, an otherwise necessary warm-up period is not required (Law & Kelton, 2000) .\\n\\nRunning this simulation from start to finish offers just one possible explanation of how the pathway dynamics can play out and so, in order to capture the inherent stochasticity, it is necessary to perform an ensemble of replications. Each replication repeats the simulation with a different stream of random numbers from which the simulated arrivals, lengths of stay, and rejection probabilities of death and survival are generated. Outputs are then aggregated across these replications, with central estimates (based on the mean), inter-quartile range (IQR), and confidence bands (at the 95% level) calculated for the performance measures considered.\\n\\nThe model is applied to intensive care services at a major public hospital in England. Following a similar approach to Deasy et al (2020) , demand for intensive care admission is estimated through local interpretation of nationwide projections contained in Ferguson et al, 2020 (controlling for local population size, demographics and hospital catchment areasee Table 1 ). This is according to two scenarios, as presented in Ferguson et al (2020) . The first is effectively a \"do nothing\" involving no restrictions on movement, while the second involves \"case isolation, home quarantine, and social distancing of those over 70\" (Figure 1 ). Informed by publication of this report on 16 th March 2020, the UK Government implemented restrictions on movement equivalent to this latter strategy, effective as of 20 th March 2020. At the hospital there are typically 45 beds available for patients requiring intensive care (21 general and 24 cardiac). In the first instance, plans are in place for capacity to be increased to a maximum of 76 beds, through making use of operating theatres and other specialist bays (which have become available due to the cancellation of routine surgery). There remains some potential to increase this number further, should additional surge capacity be required (this is considered within the scenario analysis of Section 3).\\n\\nGiven that only a handful of COVID-19 patients are, at the time of the study, admitted to an intensive care bed at the hospital (and none have either died or been discharged, i.e. observations are rightcensored), information regarding intensive care length of stay is taken from the literature. Deasy et al, 2020 estimate this to be gamma-distributed with = 8 and = 1 (see Figure 2 ), based on an analysis of experience from Wuhan (Zhou et al, 2020 , Yang et al, 2020 . Early observations of COVID-19 .

The probability of death resulting from rejected admission to intensive care ( ) was also informed by the literature. Given the pivotal dependence of survival on mechanical ventilation (White & Lo, 2020) and already very high mortality rates (81-97%) for cases actually receiving such intervention (Weiss & Murdoch, 2020) , it is assumed that all but a very small minority of rejected admissions would result in death. For the simulation study conducted here, a figure of = 0.99 is used. \\n\\nA number of scenarios relating to possible COVID-19 mitigations are modelled in order to inform planning of intensive care services at the hospital (Table 2) . These relate to changes in the epidemic curve for cases requiring intensive care (informed by government-led strategy regarding isolation, quarantine and social distancing), capacity at the hospital in terms of number of intensive care beds, and the patient length of stay in intensive care. The No isolation strategy involving no government-led effort with respect to isolation, quarantine and social distancing is considered within Scenario 1, alongside the current available capacity of 45 beds and the literature-informed gamma-distributed length of stay with mean 8 days. Given the UK Government\\'s decision on 20 th March 2020 to implement isolative measures, the remainder of scenarios (2 through 7) are configured on the basis of this aforementioned Isolation strategy (Section 2.2).\\n\\nScenarios 3 and 4 model the hospital\\'s actual planned increases in intensive care bed numbers to surge capacities of 76 and 100 respectively. Scenario 5 models the potential benefits of reducing COVID-19 length of stay (for example by using digital interventions to optimise clinical practice and workflows e.g. Bourdeaux et al 2016 , McWilliams et al 2019 by considering a one-quarter reduction in mean length of stay. There may be scope for government-led strategies to further restrict movement and thus the rate at which infections are acquired in the population. Scenarios 6 and 7 model such an eventuality by stretching the epidemic curve for cases requiring intensive care (under the Isolation strategy) by 50% (i.e. the same demand and shape, just spread over a 50% longer time period).

Quantiles, including inter-quartile range (IQR) and 95% confidence intervals, are calculated based on the variation in output measure observed across the 1000 replications performed for each scenario.

Note that strategies under Scenarios 1-5 relate to the epidemic curves for cases requiring intensive care equivalent to those contained in Figure 1 , with Scenarios 6 and 7 based upon a 50% flattened version of the Isolation curve containing the same total demand but spread over a 1.5-fold longer period of time. \\n\\nEstimates for the key output measures of interest are presented alongside each of the considered scenarios in Table 3 . Transient outputs corresponding to each of these key areas of interest are presented in Figure 3 across all scenarios. This highlights the key dynamical relationships between these variables. For instance, when full capacity is reached (left plots) then capacity-dependent deaths start to occur (middle plots) based on the extent to which demand continues to exceed supply; with the magnitude of this determining the rate at which deaths accumulate (right plots).

Employing these measures reduces total deaths by an estimated 57% and cuts the peak daily deaths by more than two-thirds ceteris paribus (Scenario 2). Increasing capacity from 45 to 76 intensive care beds (Scenario 3) further reduces total deaths by 14%, with an effect starting to show on the number of subsequent days at maximum capacity (reducing from 68 to 62). This is brought down further (to 57 days) should capacity increases to 100 beds be possible (Scenario 4), which also brings down total deaths to under 2000. Reducing mean length of stay by onequarter appears to have a relatively small improvement to the total number of deaths (Scenario 5 c.f. Scenario 2), which is in part due to the right-skewed nature of the length of stay distribution (i.e. the number of longer-staying patients in the tail is unchanged since the shape of the distribution is presumed unaltered).\\n\\nShould any additional government-led isolation strategies be effective in further flattening the epidemic curve for cases requiring intensive care, then a substantial reduction in peak deaths from 53 to 33 would be expected (i.e. Scenario 6 c.f. Scenario 2). However, without increases to capacity this simply spreads the deaths over a longer period of time, rather than reducing the total by a significant amount (2296 c.f. 2521). To achieve a significant reduction in total deaths then any \"flattening\" of demand must be accompanied by increases in capacity. If this can be accomplished, alongside the afore-mentioned reductions in length of stay, then such synergy becomes evident, cutting total capacity-dependent deaths to just over 1000, reducing the peak per day to 22, and shortening the continuous time operating at full capacity.\\n\\nIn order to estimate the number of intensive care beds required to satisfy all demand, the model can be run without a constraint on capacity. Results, under the Isolation strategy with 8 days mean length of stay, are provided in Figure 4 , showing a peak requirement of 466 beds (383 -554, 95% CI). .

As has been illustrated in this paper, such capacity-dependent deaths are closely associated with the nature of the healthcare response. The modelling and tool presented here offers planners a readily-accessible means to understand the responsiveness of capacity-dependent COVID-19 deaths to different demand profiles as well as plausible interventions under their control.\\n\\nThe modelling undertaken in this study has informed on-the-ground planning of healthcare services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, both within the healthcare system in question and more widely through public release as an R-based open source tool (hosted on github.com/nhs-bnssg-analytics and promoted via social media). Results have been useful in highlighting the need for additional intensive care beds, where decision-makers must now weigh-up the benefits of converting more beds for such purpose against the opportunity cost of such actions (e.g. if theatre space is used then this may limit the ability to perform emergency surgery). Simulation results have also been useful in understanding workforce implications (through measures relating to estimated continual time at maximum occupancy) and the planning of mortuary capacity (through understanding peak daily deaths). While the number of deaths reported in this modelling study may appear to be large against the estimated 353,862 catchment area of the hospital, they should be viewed in the context of other projections. For example, the agestratified case fatality rates of Verity et al, 2020 produce an estimated 4,349 deaths when no effort is made to explicitly model capacity-dependence in the numbers of deaths.\\n\\nAs with any modelling study, a number of simplifying assumptions were made. There is the assumption that death occurs immediately if a bed in the required setting is not available. Realistically death will not be immediate (World Health Organization, 2020 ), yet at this early stage of the pandemic there exist no reliable data to capture this parameter in the model in a meaningful way. This has no effect on the ultimate number of deaths estimated, but will affect their specific timing and the thus, the peak daily number. This should therefore be considered if seeking validation against actual number deaths over time (i.e. it should be expected that there will be a lag). It should also be acknowledged that the model does not mechanistically capture delays to discharge or transfer, which are commonplace in hospital patient flow (Landeiro et al, 2019 ). An example for the application considered here would be the inability to discharge a patient from intensive care due to the lack of an available acute bed. While this has not been modelled (this would be possible at the cost of additional complexity, see Wood & Murch, 2019) , the effects can be understood by adjusting the length of stay distribution used within the simulation according to estimated or hypothetical delay times. Finally, it is assumed in this study that all intensive care beds are available for newly-arriving COVID-19 patients. While elective procedures requiring post-operative intensive care have been cancelled, there remains other sources of non-elective non-COVID-19 intensive care demand. Estimations of this, once the effect of societal isolation becomes appreciable (e.g. any reduced road traffic accidents, alcohol-related injuries), can be incorporated within the model parameter for capacity simply by deducting the average beds occupied by such patients.\\n\\nRegarding future use of the tool and as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves and more empirical data become available, it will be possible to derive more accurate assessments of hospital length of stay and projected cases requiring hospitalisation. Given efforts to promote user-friendliness of the tool (by way of execution through a simple purpose-built function in R), any such changes to input parameter values can be readily addressed by running a small number of additional simulation runs (thus helping to ensure results remain in line with the latest data and forecasts). For the intensive care application considered here, the tool may also be used at a later stage of the pandemic in order to understand when elective cardiac surgery may safely resume following any projected reduction in COVID-19 intensive care occupancy. Further development of the model may also unlock the ability to assess the implication of different intensive care admission criteria on aggregate measures of mortality (as suggested in Utley et al, 2011 and White & Lo, 2020) . In such case the model may be used to understand the effects of rejecting intensive care admissions from patients of cohorts known to have negligible survival likelihood, in the interests of maintaining available beds for those known to have more favourable chances.\\n\\n', 'COVID-19 scenario modelling for the mitigation of capacity-dependent deaths in intensive care: computer simulation study', 'At the request of government officials from the country hardest hit by the COVID-19 crisis, we evaluate public understanding of Italian government public health messaging about the crisis. We do this via a nationally representative survey of 3,452 Italian adults between March 18th 2020 and March 20th 2020. A statement of ethical approval appears in Appendix A.\\n\\nWe draw five main conclusions and present evidence for each in the following five sections. First, most demographic groups, especially the elderly, believe in and follow health measures (Section 2). Second, even skeptics about the seriousness of the disease and of the government\\'s messaging, truthfulness, and abilities, still largely believe the messaging and report being in compliance with it (Section 3). Third, most people, especially the elderly and infirm, leave home only for reasons deemed \"essential\" (Section 4). Fourth, the population is experiencing high levels of anxiety, especially vulnerable groups (Section 5). And finally, nudges to improve attitudes and compliance that are already near their maxima have little effect (Section 6). Methodological details, including survey questions, appear in Appendix B.\\n\\nWe now present two pairs of figures describing beliefs about public health measures (Figures 1 and 2) and compliance with recommended health practices (Figures 3 and 4) . The first figure in each pair gives overall results, and the second is broken down by demographic group.\\n\\nWhat does the Italian public believe about recommended health measures regarding the COVID-19 crisis? Figure 1 shows that our subjects are appropriately cautious: nearly 100% endorse four recommended public health measures (handshake avoidance, social gathering avoidance, non-essential activities curfew, and non-essential shop closure). Of the four, the curfew and shop closure are slightly less popular, but an 89% endorsement rate is still remarkable. Compared with decades of advice to reduce smoking, drinking, and lack of exercise, these levels are very high. All demographic groups strongly agree with these four measures, though there is consistent (small) disagreement amongst respondents reporting that they are in \"excellent\" health ( Figure 2 ). When asked to reflect in writing about the social costs of reneging on the quarantine, nearly all respondents express agreement and emphasize collective responsibility. A representative (open text) reflection from the entire respondent sample reads : 3 \"I believe that EVERYONE should stay at home, leaving only for the bare minimum and taking security measures. Only in this way can we solve and solve this enormous problem in the shortest possible time.\"\\n\\nWe note that older respondents (1) consistently express worry or anxiety and (2) perceive that others in the public are reneging on their duty. A representative reflection from the 60+ subgroup reads : 4 \"I fully understand everything that is happening, so in spite of myself, I stay at home, but I would like this to include all those people who unfortunately continue to go out, especially the young, even every day! I think the longer we stay home, the sooner we get out!\"\\n\\nWe turn from respondents\\' beliefs to their actual behavior. Figure 3 shows that a majority of respondents report that they have been strongly complying with recommended health practices.\\n\\nWeek. Histograms correspond to responses to item 1 (\" In the past week, on a scale from 1-100, to what extent did the following describe your behavior?\" ) in the Appendix B. Dashed lines show average score. Figure 4 shows that seniors (60+), women, and healthier individuals say they are more compliant with most health practices. Relative to others, the young defect from social distancing and hand-washing in a statistically significant sense. Poor-health individuals are notably less compliant with staying at home, but with high variance: the reason may be their frequency of hospital and pharmacy visitation (see Figure 8 ).\\n\\nGiven the public salience of these health measures, it is likely that self-reports suffer from social desirability bias. Future studies should validate the compliance rates shown here with real-world observational data.\\n\\n.

Plots correspond to responses to item 1 (\" In the past week, on a scale from 1-100, to what extent did the following describe your behavior?\" ) in Appendix B.\\n\\nPublic opinion during this crisis is not entirely positive. Though 78% of respondents believe social distancing is an effective health measure, only 62% think the government\\'s reaction to the crisis is appropriate (rather than extreme or insufficient) and 36% think the (rest of the) public\\'s reaction is appropriate. Additionally, a slim majority of 58% believe the government has been truthful regarding information about the crisis, and only 51% of the public say they trust the Italian government to take care of them in a crisis. Are these skeptics -about health measure efficacy, the public, or the governmentdefecting from public health protocols?\\n\\nThe majority of skeptics endorse public health protocols, though with exception (red bars in Figure 5 ). 5 More than 80% within each skeptic group (i.e., low trust of government, believe information is untruthful, believe social distancing is ineffective) hold pro-health beliefs -except for those who believe the government or public is over-reacting to the virus.\\n\\n.

Skeptics about the severity of the crisis who were asked to reflect in writing about the social costs of reneging on the quarantine sometimes say that the government is \" exaggerating \" or that \" the economy and the nation are affected \". However, many still express a willingness to cooperate. As one respondent who thought government reaction was extreme responded : 6 \"It\\'s all just media. Even last year 12 thousand flu deaths and nobody spoke about it. Anyway I carry out the orders even if I don\\'t understand them. Surely Conte is not commanding but someone else\"\\n\\nThese same trends hold in behavior: remarkably, those who distrust the government, or believe the government may not be disseminating fully correct information, on average, report compliance scores 6 Translated from original Italian via Google Translate: \"Io non credo. È tutto molto mediatico. Anche l\\'anno scorso 12 mila morti di influenza e nessuno ne ha parlato. Comunque eseguo gli ordini anche se non li capisco.\\n\\nSicuramente non sta comandano Conte ma qualcun altro. \" 6 .

Unsurprisingly, skepticism in social distancing reflects in lower social distancing compliance, though average score remains nearly 80%. Those who believe reactions are over-blown were least compliant in the past week on all behaviors, but even these are with scores consistently above 70%. We do not observe direct behaviors other than through self-reports, and so following this group may be worthwhile if better measures become available.\\n\\nWeek.

Opinion groups membership constructed by trichotomizing responses to the 5-point questions in item 3.4. Highlighted red bars correspond to skeptic groups.\\n\\nWe now examine compliance with the quarantine. In particular, we examine reasons for going out ( Figures 5 and 6 ), and negative aspects of staying home (Figures 7 and 8 ).

Why are these respondents defecting from the quarantine? Figure 7 examines respondents\\' reasons for not staying home in the next 5 days. Respondents most often cite leaving home for essential reasons (e.g., procuring food, retrieving medicine) rather than non-essential reasons (e.g., getting bored, meeting friends). Of those who express a need to leave, 95% cite at least one essential reason while only 18% cite any non-essential reasons. Figure 8 shows that, generally, those needing to leave for essential reasons are more often older while those leaving for increasingly non-essential reasons are (slightly more often) younger people below the age of 30. Older people say they are defecting to procure groceries; the middle-aged to go to work; the less healthy and elderly to receive medical treatment.\\n\\n8 .

Still, there are group-specific negative experiences ( Figure 10 ). Younger people more often say they are struggling with increased boredom and family conflict. Meanwhile, vulnerable groups like the elderly and the health-compromised more consistently cite loneliness relative to others.\\n\\n.

Those who are likely working parents (aged 40-49) more consistently cite economic distress and struggles with home-schooling and work than other groups (which, of course, might well have been the case if we had a control group from before the crisis). Overall, this confirms that different demographic groups are struggling with different aspects of quarantining. Going forward, these groups might benefit from personalized \"morale-boosting\" interventions.\\n\\nThe average level of anxiety surrounding the crisis in the population is high: none of our respondents reported being completely without anxiety ( Figure 11 ).\\n\\n. CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\n\\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . Who is most anxious about the circumstances right now? Figure 12 shows that the most anxious relative to their group are: women, respondents with poor health, and older adults. Although anxiety might be driving healthy behaviors and pro-health beliefs described above, additional anxiety due to ones\\' vulnerable status is likely to negatively impact long-term mental health. It is possible that increased messaging may not inform but rather exacerbate anxiety for inherently vulnerable groups like seniors and the immunocompromised. Despite these differences, the overall levels are very high for every group. \\n\\nIn case the messaging was not effective, we implemented a fully randomized survey experiment with informational interventions to try to drive strong pro-health beliefs (Figure 1 and 2) and positive opinions about the crisis response ( Figure 5 and 6) . A third of respondents assigned to the control group received no message, a third received a message about social externalities with a prompt for reflection (\" If you are infected with COVID-19, you are likely to infect 2,000 people -including your and your friends\\' parents and grandparents, who might die. Join the great majority of Italians and stay home. Please write 1-2 sentences reflecting on this message. How does it make you think/feel?\" ), and the last third received a message about social externalities with a prompt to name a vulnerable loved one ( \"If you are infected 11 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\n\\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.20042820 doi: medRxiv preprint with COVID-19, you are likely to infect your parents, your friends\\' parents, and/or one any one of your close ones. If they are older than 50, they may die. In the text field below, please name a loved one (example: my father, my grandmother) that you\\'re most worried about contracting COVID-19.\" ).\\n\\nIn fact, these beliefs were so close to the ceiling to begin with, there was little room for an intervention to have an effect. Figure 13 and 14 report the results. Nearly everyone in all three messaging groups -social externalities with reflection, social externalities with personal naming, and no message -agreed on the necessity of canceling social gatherings, closing non-essential businesses, imposing a curfew, and avoiding physical contact. The treatments did little to decrease skepticism or cause backlash (Figure 14) . We further did not find that receiving treatments changed any intention to leave home in the coming week or the reasons for doing so. There were also no significant treatment heterogeneities on any outcome by gender, age, health group, anxiety levels, or any past behavioral reports or other attitudinal traits. This is consistent with a theory of information overload : that is, before our intervention, everyone already received this information and accepted its importance from previous studies, advertising, government messaging, friends, family, and other sources (though some rejected). Therefore, additional information is unlikely to change anyone\\'s beliefs on the necessity of the given measures. Indeed the maximum theoretical effect (which would be seen by moving these percentages up to 100%) was close to the measurement uncertainty. 12 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\n\\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . Finally, were people willing to share this message? We gave respondents the option of sharing a message (of their choosing) with up to 5 people. The vast majority (90%) chose not to share the message, but~100 people who received our reflection treatment were significantly less likely to share with anyone. Those who did share were consistently people who strongly believed in the efficacy of social distancing. Nothing else predicted sharing behavior, including receiving an information treatment. There are two explanations for this: (1) most skipped over this prompt (2) most, other than those who strongly endorse social distancing, believe their friends and families already know, and wouldn\\'t additionally benefit from, this information. The latter is consistent with our theory of information overload . It is likely that we can greatly expand this behavior by tuning this message.\\n\\nOverall, this experiment suggests receiving new information is not changing beliefs, behavioral intentions, or message-spreading, largely because the population had adopted these beliefs prior to our survey. In other words, the control group, with no messaging from us, has been receiving the same messaging in other ways for weeks.\\n\\nThe Italian population is receiving public health messaging, understands it, and most -save for small numbers of young people and skeptics -claim to be following it closely. Those who take it seriously defect for mostly universally recognized acceptable reasons (e.g., groceries, medicine). New messaging campaigns designed to accomplish the same purpose should not be the focus at this point.\\n\\nHowever, the negative psychological effects of the quarantine -most commonly boredom, perceived immobility, and anxiety -are beginning to wear on people and seem likely to become more serious over 13 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\n\\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .\\n\\ntime. If we expect the Italian people to remain inside and keep following the recommendations of public health officials for the next few weeks or even months (as may be necessary to curb the spread of COVID-19) it would be helpful to find ways of reducing these negative effects of the quarantine. A messaging campaign that suggests how to make the quarantine easier and more frictionless, rather than repeating the now well-known dire reasons to stay indoors, should begin. Possibilities include messaging about online collective exercises, social reading activities (e.g., Perusall.com for schools and universities), safe ways for people to get fresh air outside, classes (e.g., edx.org for online classes), or novel ways of bridging social capital between young and old, or even distribution of inexpensive tablets or laptops to ensure the whole population has video conferencing abilities. If we look for activities and interventions that make the quarantine easier for those affected by it, the population may be able to better tolerate the treatment for as long as it takes to overcome this public health crisis. respondent of an intensely personal impact of non-compliance with the quarantine. The message was as follows:\\n\\n\"If you are infected with COVID-19, you are likely to infect your parents, your friends\\' parents, and/or one any one of your close ones. If they are older than 50, they may die.\\n\\nIn the text field below, please name a loved one (example: my father, my grandmother) that you\\'re most worried about contracting COVID-19.\"\\n\\nThe third group received no message, as a control condition for comparison. In a pre-test, the social externalities messaging outperformed most other messages framing the risks of noncompliance with safety measures -including messages framed around pro-sociality, expert or celebrity advice, and healthcare sector externalities (i.e. \"flatten the curve\").\\n\\nThe survey proceeded by then asking respondents for their beliefs, social perceptions, and perceived efficacy about government and/or public safety measures. Respondents were also asked about their trust in government and the degree to which the government was providing factual information about the crisis. We asked respondents a series of questions about anxiety, stress, and worry around the current circumstances.\\n\\nNext, respondents were asked about their future behaviors -namely whether they planned to leave the house in the next 5 days, and their top reasons for leaving, as well as negative aspects of complying with staying at home.\\n\\nFinally, respondents took a brief personality battery, provided personal demographic information, and were asked whether they would share either the social externalities message or some other message of their choosing with upto 5 of their friends or loved ones via text or email.\\n\\nTo draw our sample, we used the market research platform Lucid, which has been shown to produce high quality, representative samples (Coppock and McClellan, 2019) . Data was collected between March 18th and March 20th, 2020, with the following characteristics:\\n\\n• 3452 respondents, • 1655 males, 1675 females, 14 others, 108 unidentified • 615 aged 18-29, 732 aged 30-39, 639 aged 50-59, 440 aged 60+\\n\\nWe asked respondents the following questions, most of which came from several members of our team involved in a related effort getting underway (see https://osf.io/3sn2k/).\\n\\n.
