Adapting the classical epidemic modelling framework, two distinct routes of COVID-19 transmission are incorporated into a model: (a) direct person-to-person contact transmission, and (b) indirect airborne and fomites-driven transmission. The indirect non-contact transmission route needs to explored in models of COVID-19 spread, because evidences show that this route of transmission is entirely viable with hugely uncertain level of relative contribution. This theoretical study based on model simulations demonstrates the following:",

Based on these results, this study recommends that any exit policy from lockdown, should take into account the level of transmission reduction in both routes, the absolute scale of which will vary among countries depending on their health-service capacity, but should be computed using accurate time-series data on infection cases and transmission rates.",

This constraint imposes uncertainty in predicting and mitigating COVID-19 infection within the boundary of any country. Scientists have further warned that it could take long time to gather sufficient data on this route of infection, which may cost more lives (Nature report). The role of indirect transmission on the infection dynamics, therefore, has been less explored or unexplored in the context of COVID-19 modelling. In other epidemiological models, however, the non-contact route of infection has been explored previously e.g., [7, 8] . Here, non-contact transmission is included in an SEIR model, and its impact is explored in conjunction with mitigation measures. Further details on model equation, parameterisation and simulations methods are given in the appendix.",

For the SEIR model under investigation, R 0 was calculated from the next-generation matrix [9] . The magnitude of R 0 obtained with person-to-person contact as the only route of transmission, appears to be an underestimation when non-contact transmission is active (Fig. 1 ). If the relative contribution of non-contact transmission is very small, changes in R 0 is generally negligible. But R 0 increases sharply with the relative contribution of non-contact transmission (Fig. 1) . For example, whilst a 50% relative contribution of non-contact transmission increases R 0 by 15-35%, a 150% relative contribution can double it (depending on the nature of infection). Since in the case of COVID-19 the contribution of non-contact transmission is unknown, it is uncertain as to what extent R 0 will spike if no action is taken to reduce this route of transmission.",

Unsurprisingly, the model simulations generally confirms this assumption ( Fig. 2 ). Any level of reduction in transmission over a sufficiently-long lockdown period will lower the peak of infection from 'no-action' scenario ( Fig. 2) . The real success of lockdown measures, however, will be to keep the primary infection peak always below a Country's health-services capacity (see, Fig. 2 , the horizontal red lines representing some hypothetical health-service capacities). But this is possible only if the transmission rates reduce considerably -see Fig. 2 for various scenarios, and the decrease in peak as a consequence.",

Under such an optimistic scenario, the evolution of secondary peak, its height, time of occurrence and duration solely depend on the duration of lockdown (see, green lines in Fig. 3 ). For example, with a hypothetical health-service capacity equal to 30% of the noaction peak, the first 30 days of lockdown show significant reduction in the infection cases (see, red and green lines in the first window, Fig. 3) , giving a false impression that the subsequent infection cases will stay below the capacity. But once the lockdown is fully lifted, the infection cases spike rapidly over a short time, and the peak goes beyond the capacity, almost nearing the noaction peak. This scenario demonstrates the ultimate failure of the suppression measures as a consequence of premature end of lockdown.",

Although longer lockdown reduces the primary peak, the scale of the reduction does not change beyond a certain point of time (first and second window, Fig. 4 ). Non-contact transmission plays a key role here, and if this transmission rate is proactively reduced through disinfection measures, the impact of longer lockdown will be realised on the number of new cases. Under a hypothetical scenario, with a 50% reduction in contact transmission and 10% reduction in non-contact transmission, any impact on the primary peak and its occurrence may cease after 30 days of lockdown. However, under the same set up, if both transmissions reduce by 75%, the impact on primary peak and its occurrence can persist 90 days and beyond, which will bring down the primary infection cases (first and second window, Fig. 4) .",

There is, however, the possibility that the indirect or non-contact transmission route is ignored, which will be less helpful in reducing the infection cases in situation where the relative strength of this transmission rate is high. Therefore, pro-active measures should be taken to reduce non-contact transmission. Some of those measures may involve frequent and wider uses of areal and aerosol disinfectant in public spaces to improve contaminated surfaces and air, as has been done by certain countries (e.g., China, World Economic Forum report). Ignoring non-contact transmission should not be compensated by far stricter lockdown or unachievable lockdown measures, as the mitigation strategy should not be solely based on contact route of transmission.",
