So far, 1.6 million cases and over 100,000 deaths have been reported world-wide ([1], 10.4.2020) . However, true prevalence rates are unknown as in most countries large-scale population testing has still not been introduced.

This could be overcome by group testing, a method first suggested by Dorfman for testing large populations of U.S. soldiers for syphilis [2] . The idea of group testing involves the division of the population into small groups. For each group, a combined sample ('pool') of its members is created and tested. If the pool tests negative, it can be concluded that all group members are negative and no individual tests will be required. If the pool tests positive, further tests will have to be performed to determine which group member(s) are positive. One ad-hoc model of group testing, using pools of up to 10 samples, has recently been applied for SARS-CoV-2 PCR [3] . More refined variants of group testing are for example used in HIV screening [3] [4]; but these pool sizes seem to exceed the sensitivity of current SARS-CoV-2 testing methods [5] .",

However, recent research indicates that pooling of 16 samples does not seem to substantially impact test sensitivity of SARS-Cov-2 PCR tests [5] . Second, the number of stages should be reasonable. Each additional stage increases the workload and the risk of human error. Furthermore, stages have to be processed sequentially, increasing the time to get the diagnosis.

To estimate the potential savings of tests we can use real-world data [1] (dated 10.04.2020). In order not to overestimate the prevalence rate, we considered data from countries which have performed large-scale population testing, namely South Korea and Germany. In South Korea a total of 503,051 people have been tested, of which 10,450 were positive. This gives an estimate for the underlying prevalence rate of 2%. At this prevalence rate the multi-stage testing scheme P16S3 is optimal and would allow for testing about five times as many individuals with the same number of tests. In Germany, a total of 1,317,887 people were tested, of which 118,235 were positive. This gives a higher prevalence rate of around 9%. In this case the multi-stage scheme P9S3 is optimal; it would enable the testing of an additional 80% of individuals (compared to only 30% improvement based on the P10S2 scheme suggested in [6] ). Note that these numbers have a selection bias, as individuals with COVID-19 symptoms were more likely to be tested. By introducing large-scale testing, established true prevalence rates will probably be lower, which would automatically yield even better improvement factors of the testing schemes.",

Stage 2: all samples belonging to a negative pool are considered negative and not further tested (grey). All samples from positive pools are tested individually.In total, 18 samples were tested with 12 tests (1.5 samples per test). With lower prevalence rates, P3S2 can, on average, test up to 3 samples with 1 test.Scheme P16S3 (right) is applied to 32 samples, one of which is positive. Stage 1: 2 groups of 16 samples are pooled and tested. Stage 2: All samples in the negative group must be negative and are hence not tested further. Samples in the positive group are pooled into 4 subgroups of 4 samples and each pool is tested. Stage 3: The remaining 4 samples in the one positive pool are tested individually.",
