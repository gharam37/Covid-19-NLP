For reference, a national emergency was declared in response to COVID- 1 1 5 19 the afternoon of March 13, 2020 [12] . The sample includes the 356 participants enrolled from March 3 through March 12, 2020. Individuals were recruited via pre-existing email recruitment lists, flyers circulated on campus, 1 1 9 advertising announcements on classes, and advertisements in university locations. Inclusion Results are analyzed in Stata (version 16). The focal variables relating to COVID-19 1 2 3 were captured using a 5-point Likert scale. When more convenient for exposition or analysis, 1 2 4 these responses are simplified into binary variables (very or moderately likely/concerned = 1; all 1 2 5 other responses = 0). We also define the variable National, Not Local to equal one when 1 2 6 participants think a national crisis is very or moderately likely but are neither very nor 1 2 7 moderately concerned about contracting the virus by attending campus events.

Further, 3 4 6 the classification tree finds that, similar to the randomly assigned information about food waste, 3 4 7 participants who were randomly assigned compostable paper plates and the participant's 3 4 8 recycling habits also work as significant determinants of Local Vulnerability. One conjecture is 3 4 9 that participants who link the implications of individual behaviors to issues of sustainability may There is a persistent group consisting of about 30% of participants who, for the entire 3 5 3 study period, including the final day, do not translate their perceived likelihood of a national 3 5 4 public health crisis into personal vulnerability from attending campus events (National, not 3 5 5 Local). These are likely a critical group in terms of modeling diffusion of COVID-19, as Poletti 3 5 6 et al. [22] emphasize the role of translating perceived risk into preventative behaviors such as However, our analysis provides few insights into the characteristics associated with 3 5 9 National, not Local group. Regression analysis finds few significant associations other than the 3 6 0 fact that older non-students are less likely to feature this response pattern and that those who spontaneously attended the study in response to same-day receipt of flyers were more likely. The former suggests that younger people in academic settings may be diagnostic for predicting 3 6 3 this response pattern while the latter may be suggestive that certain personality traits have 3 6 4 predictive power. This lack of insight into the National, not Local group is likely due to the post-hoc nature 3 6 6 of the analysis, one of several study limitations.
