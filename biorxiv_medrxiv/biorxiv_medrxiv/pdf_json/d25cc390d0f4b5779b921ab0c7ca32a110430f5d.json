To date, 4 protocols based on CRISPR for detecting SARS-CoV-2 have been published [3] [4] [5] [6] . Using lateral flow protocols, RNA samples harboring more than 1 \u00d7 10 4 -1 \u00d7 10 5 copies/mL (SHERLOCK) or 1 \u00d7 10 4 copies/mL (DETECTR) can be detected within 1 hour.

According to fluorescence kinetics studies, sgRNA-3 stood out in not only being able to distinguish between the 2 similar coronaviruses but also being able to produce the most distinct As previously demonstrated, CRISPR is unable to detect any target DNA when there is less than 1-10 nM of amplification product within the reaction mix [7] .

Recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) can amplify substrates 10 10 times at most (from aM to 10 nM) within 10-30 minutes at constant temperature between 37 o C to 42 o C, complementing the needs of CRISPR-based detection. Thus, we designed and screened RAA primers that matched our previously optimized sgRNA-3 (Supplementary information, Fig. S4a ). Based on our screens, we found that by using the best primer pairs together with sgRNA-3, we can detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples containing 5 \u00d7 10 3 copies/mL ( Fig. 1c and Supplementary information, Fig. S4b-c) .",

However, it would be best to conduct both reactions within a single tube for convenience and, more importantly, to prevent aerosol contamination which happens when the reaction mixture has to be exposed to the environment midway through the protocol. Hence, we tried to execute both the RT-RAA and CDetection concurrently within a single tube. However, the combination resulted in a drastic decrease in sensitivity ( Fig. 1c and Supplementary information, Fig. S7 ). Therefore, in order to keep both the RT-RAA and CRISPR reactions within a single tube, we executed the RT-RAA reaction within the tube while keeping the CDetection reagents within the lid of the tube for 30 minutes, following which, the CDetection reagents were spun down into the tube for nucleic acid detection, and the resultant reaction mixture was imaged for fluorescence.",

CASdetec can detect pseudovirus samples with more than 1 \u00d7 10 4 copies/mL, with no cross-reactivity with other endemic human coronaviruses. In addition, we optimized the workflow to run both reactions within one single tube without lid opening. This will thus prevent aerosol contamination and reduce the false positive rate.",
