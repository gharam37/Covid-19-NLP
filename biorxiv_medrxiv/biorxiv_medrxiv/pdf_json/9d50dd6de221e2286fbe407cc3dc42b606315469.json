Taking advantage of the Network of Italian Genomes (NIG), here we mined around 7000 exomes from 5 different Centers looking for ACE2 variants. A number of variants with a potential impact on protein stability were identified. Among these, three missense changes, p.Asn720Asp, p.Lys26Arg, p.Gly211Arg (MAF 0.002 to 0.015), which have never been reported in the Eastern Asia population, were predicted to interfere with protein u and stabilization.

An initial cluster of infections likely due to animal-to-human transmission was rapidly followed by a human-to-human transmission (4) . The disease was recognized to be caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) and termed coronavirus disease 19 . The infection spread within China and all over the world, and it has been declared as pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 2 nd March 2020. The symptoms of COVID-19 range from fever, dry cough, fatigue, u congestion, sore throat and diarrhea to severe interstitial bilateral pneumonia with a ground-glass image at the CT scan. While recent studies provide evidence of a high number of asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic patients who represent the main reservoir for the infection progression, the severe cases can rapidly evolve towards a respiratory distress syndrome which can be lethal (5) . Although age and comorbidity have been described as the main determinants of disease progression towards severe respiratory distress, the high variation in clinical severity among middle-age adults and children would likely suggest a strong role of the host genetic asset.

Recent studies modelled the spike protein to identify the receptor for 2019-nCov, and indicated that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for this novel coronavirus (7, 8) . Zhou et. al. conducted virus infectivity studies and showed that ACE2 is essential for 2019-nCov to enter HeLa cells (9) . Although the binding strength between 2019-nCov and ACE2 is weaker than that between SARS-CoV and ACE2, it is considered as much high as threshold necessary for virus infection. The spike glycoprotein (S-protein), a trimeric glycoprotein in the virion surface (giving the name of crown -corona in latin-), mediates receptor recognition throughout its receptor binding domain (RBD) and membrane fusion (10,11). Based on recent reports, 2019-nCov protein binds to ACE2 through Leu455, Phe486, Gln493, Asn501, and Tyr505. It has been postulated that residues 31, 41, 82, 353, 355, and 357 of the ACE2 receptor map to the surface of the protein interacting with 2019-nCov spike protein (12), as previously documented for SARS-CoV.",

Along with the other two common variants, this substitution is significantly represented in the Italian and European populations but is extremely rare in the Asian population. We also show that three rare variants, namely, p.Trp69Cys, p.Leu351Val and p.Pro389His are predicted to cause conformational changes impacting RBD interaction.

Among these the p.Trp69Cys has never been reported before and it is likely to be an Italian population-private rare variant. Other rare variants are predicted to truncate the protein in different positions of the Protease domain thus likely acting on the internalization process. These rare variants would likely account for the interindividual clinical variability and likely explain severity even in young adults. Notably, morbidity and lethality have been reported definitely higher in men compared to women (~70% vs 30%, 20th March 2020 ISS report). Although several parameters have been brought to case to explain this difference, i.e. smoking, differences in ACE2 localization and/or density in alveolar cells, hormonal asset, it is noteworthy that ACE2 is located on chromosome X and that given the low allele frequency of the identified variants the rate of homoz\u00ecgous women is extremely low (see Results section).",

This hypothesis would justify the high rate of asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic patients. ACE2 is definitely one of the main molecules whose genetic heterogeneity can modulate infection and disease progression; however a deeper characterisation of the host genetics and functional variants in other pathway-related genes may help in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease opening up the way to a stratified risk assessment and to tailored preventive measures and treatments. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

In addition to these variants, 30 rare missense variants were identified, out of which 12 had not previously been reported in GnomAD database and 13 truncating variants that had not been reported in gnomAD database (Tab 1, Supplementary Table 1). Out of these variants, two fall in the neck domain, which is essential for dimerization and one in the intracellular domain. Many of them truncate the protein in different positions of the Protease domain embedded in the extracellular domain, which contains the receptor binding site for COVID-19. Only three truncating mutations have been previously described for ACE2 likely due to a low-tolerance for loss-of function variants, in line with this quite all of them (11/13) were detected in women in heterozygous state.

We analysed by MD simulations the structural changes of two specific missense mutations: the V506A that showed the higher destabilizing effect and the W69C whose surrounding residues, (30-41) segment, are involved in 2019-nCOV Spike protein interaction. To analyse differences in protein structure between wild type and mutants (V506A and W69C), we performed 100ns MD simulations. The comparison was performed by RMSD. The global effects of the residue substitutions on flexibility and global correlated motion of ACE2 protein are represented inFigure 2and the simulation is provided inSupplementary Figure 1and 2. While a similar trend for wild-type and V506A is observed with a steady course in the RMSD value, which stabilizes at an average of 0.2 nm and 0,3 nm, respectively (Figure 3, panel A) the W69C variant shows a difference in comparison with the native protein with a gradual increase in RMSD value, which stabilizes at an average of 0.5 nm (Figure 3, panel B). During MD simulations, we have also investigated the surrounding region of ACE2 WT and W69C variant by calculating change in Solvent Accessibility Surface Area (SASA). Structural analysis between WT and V506A mutant MD simulations showed that Val506 forms a hydrophobic centre together with Leu456, Leu503 and Phe516 with minimum differences in protein rearrangements when the residue is mutated in Ala as reported in Figure 3, panel A and confirmed by SASA superimposition (Figure 3, panel B). Trp69 together with Phe70 and Leu71 is normally involved in a hydrophobic core with Leu38 and Phe39 of (30-41) 2019-nCOV interaction region and, on the contrary, a drastic rearrangement of protein structure is observed when, as consequence of the amino acid change (Trp in Cys), its central role is substituted by Phe39 as confirmed by SASA superimposition (Figure 3, panel B, 1 1 Supplementary Figure 2). Differences in average SASA value would suggest for the native protein a wider surface exposed to solvent and subsequently a different ability to interact with spike 2019-nCov in comparison with the variants. DISCUSSION According to recent reports, ACE2 is essential for 2019-nCov to enter cells. Recent single-cell RNA studies have also shown that ACE2 is expressed in human lung cells (26). The majority of ACE2-expressing cells are alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells. Other ACE2 expressing cells include alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells, airway epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages although their ACE2-expressing cell ratio is low and variable among individuals. The expression and distribution of the ACE2 receptor can thus justify the route of infection and the main localization at the alveolar level. Although the different density of ACE2 receptors in the upper respiratory tract among individuals can partially give reason for the clinical variability, which ranges from asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic patients to severely affected ones, it cannot be the only reason for this variability. In addition, recent works did not observe significantly different viral loads in nasal swabs between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (27). Italy has been the first European country that experienced the COVID-19 outbreak with a rapid increase in the positive cases in a very short-time period and a morbidity and lethality (~10%) definitely higher in comparison with Asian countries, such as China (4%) and South Chorea (1.2%) according to the OMS reports.These considerations raise the the possibility of a predisposing genetic background accounting for or contributing to the wide inter-individual clinical variability, as well All rights reserved.

            "text": ", Rome) interconnected by the Network for Italian Genome (NIG) in the attempt to identify variation encompassing the ACE2 gene, which could account for a difference in 2019-nCov spike binding affinity, processing or internalization. Previous studies showed that the residues near lysine 31, and tyrosine 41, 82-84, and 353-357 in human ACE2 are important for the binding of S-protein to coronavirus (12). In line with previous reports (28), we did not find polymorphism or rare variants in these residues in the Italian population. However, we identified three variants p.Asn720Asp, p.Lys26Arg, p.Gly211Arg, one of which polymorphic (p.Asn720Asp), moderately expressed in the Italian and European-non Finnish populations and with a very low allele frequency or not occurring in the Eastern Asia population. These variants which surround residual essentials for the 2019-nCov spike binding are predicted to likely affect the cleavage dependent virion intake, such as the Asn720Asp which lies 4 amino acids from the cleavage sequence of TMPRSS2. Give their rarity in other populations, we cannot exclude that these variants can partially account for the higher morbidity and lethality observed in the Italian and European-non Finnish population. Indeed, while this manuscript was in preparation, COVID-19 was drastically spreading all over Europe severely impacting other Latin countries such as Spain (6% lethality) and France (4%).",
