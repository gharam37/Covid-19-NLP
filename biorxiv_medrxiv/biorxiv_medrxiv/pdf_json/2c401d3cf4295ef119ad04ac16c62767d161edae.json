The national government required sports and entertainment events to be canceled in Japan for two weeks fromFebruary 26 through March 19 according to a government advisory. At the same time, it was advised that small business and private meetings be cancelled voluntarily. Moreover, from March 3, almost all schools were closed to control the spread of the infection until spring vacation began in the middle of March. The policy was designated as voluntary event cancellation (VECSC). Consequently, the COVID-19 outbreak can be divided into four distinct periods: before VCSEC through February 26, VCSECthrough March 19, and after VCSEC through April 7, and the after emergency was declared. We defined the reproduction numbers for the respective periods as R 0 , R v , R a , and R e .",
