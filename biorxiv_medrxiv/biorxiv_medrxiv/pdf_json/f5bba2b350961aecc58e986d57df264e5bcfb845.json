No specific treatment has been established against coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) so far. Therefore, it is urgently needed to identify effective antiviral agents for the treatment of this disease, and several approved drugs such as lopinavir have been evaluated. Here, we report that nelfinavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor, potently inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2. The effective concentrations for 50% and 90% inhibition (EC50 and EC90) of nelfinavir were 1.13 \u00b5M and 1.76 \u00b5M respectively, the lowest of the nine HIV-1 protease inhibitors including lopinavir. The trough and peak serum concentrations of nelfinavir were three to six times higher than EC50 of this drug. These results suggest that nelfinavir is a potential candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 and should be assessed in patients with COVID-19.",

After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, screening of approved drugs identified at least two human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors, lopinavir and nelfinavir, as compounds that inhibited SARS-CoV replication in vitro 3, 4 . In the open-label study with SARS patients in 2004, the group treated with lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) in addition to ribavirin showed better clinical outcomes than the control group treated with only ribavirin 3 . Because SARS-CoV-2 is relatively similar to SARS-CoV 5 , it is expected that these drugs will be effective for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. To select the candidate drug for the clinical evaluation, the data of antiviral activity in vitro are of great help. However, there is no basic information about the effective concentration of HIV-1 protease inhibitors to abrogate SARS-CoV-2 replication. Thus, in the present study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of nine approved HIV-1 protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.",

SARS-CoV-2 was propagated in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. All the infection experiments were performed in a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) laboratory. Nelfinavir a kind gift from Torii pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., and lopinavir was a kind gift from Abbott laboratories. Ritonavir (cat. no. HY-90001), saquinavir (HY-17003), atazanavir (HY-17367A), tipranavir (HY-15148), amprenavir (HY-17430), darunavir (HY-17040), and indinavir (HY-B0689A) were purchased from MedchemExpress (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA). Camostat (3193, Tocris Bioscience, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and E64d (330005, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) were used as the entry inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. Evaluation of cytotoxicity and antiviral activity of the drugs Confluent cells in 96-well plates were treated with the HIV-1 protease inhibitors. After incubation for 24 h, MTS assays were performed to measure the cell viability using CellTiter 96 AQueous One reagent (G3580, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To evaluate the antiviral efficacy of these drugs, in 96-well plates were infected with virus at a MOI of 0.01 in the presence of the drugs. After 2 h of incubation, the media with the virus-drug mixture were removed and cells were further cultured with the drug-containing media. The cell culture supernatants collected at 24 hpi was diluted 10-fold in water, then boiled. For time-of-addition assay, drugs were added to cell cultures at 0 or 3.5 hpi, and subsequently cellular RNA was extracted at 6 hpi using a CellAmp Direct RNA Prep Kit (3732, Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). The qRT-PCR assays were performed to quantify the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA with QuantStudio 3 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using primers and R., et al.
