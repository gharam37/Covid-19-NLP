Much of the promise of this new strategy is obscured by the inadequacy of available technology to discern altered biological pathways in a noninvasive fashion and concomitantly view multiple different facets of altered biology. Whenever a disease process is multi-systemic such as infection, neoplasm, or toxin-mediated, blood has potential to provide early detection to characterize injury. RNAseq has been implemented in many trait mapping projects, using large cohorts of specific phenotypes/trait groups relative to controls to identify biomarkers. It remains to be shown how the millions of dollars of integrated RNAseq work can be translated into individual patients of broad phenotypes to guide precision medicine. The power of RNA generated data likely is in its potential to effect therapeutic changes in individual patients with diverse clinical presentations, such as Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS). COVID-19 infections highlight this point well, where not every patient with COVID-19 needs to be treated for the MODS that results in lethality, just those that advance into sepsis, where biomarkers of these pathways are critical for earlier treatment of patients.",

This is ideal for the development and implementation of rapid precision/personalized medicine. Multi-time point analyses that can dissect disease using omic technologies in n=1 biology is currently lacking in the PICU. Patients with MODS have high rates of morbidity and mortality and represent some of the most complex cases within the PICU. Using a combination of PAXgene tubes with ribosomal reduced RNAseq, we present here a dissection of both cellular and acellular RNA signatures of PICU MODS patients, suggesting utility for transcriptomics in precision medicine.",

            "text": "Over the last decade, our ability to extend life in patients with MODS through interventions like dialysis and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has improved, but there remains an inability to serially track the dyshomeostasis induced by disease from trigger to organ injury, an endpoint for a variety of infectious and noninfectious agents. To halt injury to organs and promote recovery, the clinical team needs rapid, actionable clinical information within the short treatment window of any ICU. That information needs to include simultaneously the etiology, i.e., was it infectious or non-infectious, and the extent of homeostatic disruption. Bacterial cultures take at least 24 hours to grow and 72 hours to speciate. Viral panels only check for common viruses, requiring insights of what to test. Both viral and bacterial analyses are often only ordered when the phenotype is suspected of matching, meaning unique responses are often missed for proper diagnosis. At the same time, the treating physicians are often unsure of the patient's clinical state, such as whether the patient is immunosuppressed or experiencing an overwhelming immune and inflammatory response (1) (2) (3) . We are seeing that even in epidemics from an infectious agent like COVID-19, there are differing clinical phenotypes that lead to MODS, requiring changes in therapeutic course (4, 5) . In any critically ill patient with MODS, the first 48 hours are spent by the clinical team supporting organ function with little ability to make effective changes to the clinical course. At present, our perception of organ damage is limited to a few organs that have validated, but imperfect means of measurement such as the heart, lung, kidney, liver, and brain, missing markers for many other tissues. The transcriptome is an attractive tool, offering a snapshot of the interaction between affecting pathology and patients' biology. Thus, transcriptomics is a practical, real-time approach to diagnosis and management, which with decreasing time of processing and improved computational capacity to provide insight, could be a powerful tool to predict disease etiology and clinical course. Doing so reduces diagnostic odyssey in a population that can ill afford delay, providing an agnostic guide to patient-specific disease. The individual responses seen in each MODS patient make this group a prime cohort for personalized/precision medicine strategy development (6), as we lay forth below.",

While mostly even numbers of male/female in CT and MODS, ECMO patients tend to be male. Renal failure (89%-MODS, 100%-ECMO) and liver failure (30%-MODS 50%-ECMO) are higher in ECMO than MODS group. Eight of the patients were transferred from local hospitals to Helen DeVos Children's Hospital (HDVCH) to receive more advanced PICU support at a quaternary children's hospital. A total of 12 patients had been diagnosed with additional comorbidities, including multiple rare diseases diagnosed via genomics. Blood draws were done on each patient followed by RNAseq, with 6 patients having only a day0 transcriptome, 8 with day0/3, and 13 with day0/3/8 transcriptomes (Fig. 1 ) based on length of stay in the PICU.",

A previously healthy, active 16-year old female was admitted with fever, malaise weakness, and upper respiratory symptoms that progressed rapidly into multi-organ failure (Fig. 8A) . The symptoms started about ten days before hospital presentation and were mainly respiratory. She was initially treated at home with a 10-day course of Amoxicillin. Over the next week, she continued to deteriorate, with on and off febrile episodes thought to be \"flu-like\" with significant myalgia, eventually becoming bedridden with altered mental status leading to an ED visit. She continued to deteriorate despite cardiac support and required ECMO within 24 hours of being admitted to HDVCH PICU. The rapid deterioration was suggestive of viral illness (identifying EBV by PCR), a ferritin level >10,000 ng/L, and a bone marrow exam suggested Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a diagnosis that typically takes several days to make but is visible in day0 RNAseq. The patient samples cluster relative to CT and a two year follow up transcriptome (Fig. 8B) . A second tool confirmed EBV reads from RNAseq, including the gene EBER1 (Fig. 8C) . Rapid whole-exome sequencing identified compound heterozygous mutations in RNASEH2B that GeneDx annotated as likely pathogenic for Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res, V20L (paternal), and a potential splicing variant c.245-8A>G (material). Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res is typically an early-onset autoinflammatory systemic lupus erythematosus (46) , which is commonly associated with HLH. The V20L variant based on our computational tools has no alteration of the protein (Fig. 8D-E) , suggesting it to be benign, and therefore, the patient does not have homozygous associated Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res. However, the V20L variant was used to show an allelic imbalance from the RNAseq that was pronounced on all but day0 (Fig. 8F) , suggesting that a unique form of Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res may be present.",

Levels of RNASEH2B were around 50% in later days (Fig. 8H) , suggesting the splice variant had a dominant-negative effect, which would be normally suppressed by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). This loss of NMD in day0 sample is interesting and correlates with the increasing copies of serum EBV noted clinically and in the RNAseq. Interestingly, it is known that EBV coded proteins can suppress nonsense-mediated decay (47) . With the patient's potential syndromic biology identified, the patient had a two year follow up transcriptome analysis. This revealed excessive inflammation and continued alterations in the immune system (Fig. 8I ). The immune system was profiled by sequencing the CDR3 region of seven chains, identifying a high level of IgD (Fig. 8J) , and low diversity of immunoglobulin kappa and lambda chains with enrichment of a functional motif (Fig. 8K) . Hyper-IgD syndrome can be caused by mutations in MVK, and this gene was reanalyzed in the exome and showed 100% coverage at a minimum of 10X with no variants identified. This all suggests that the patient has extensive immune system dysfunction that, combined with an active EBV infection turning on the suppressed RNASEH2B splice variant to cause a dominant-negative HLH that recovered as the EBV was cleared. This patient represents an example of the complex interplay between environment and genetics that we coin as viral induced dominance and highlights the power and need for precision transcriptomic analysis performed on more patients, with these cases missed in large cohort-style study design.",

While fields like oncology have embraced these tools, their value remains undetermined for most other areas in health care. Patients admitted to the intensive care units have altered homeostatic pathways that result from unclear triggers. Transcriptomics has the potential not only to identify the degree of disruption but identify etiology in patients that often don't have the luxury of time for a long diagnostic odyssey. Thus far for PICU patients, strategies have focused on developing larger cohorts based on similarity of immune responses, typically utilizing microarray strategies focusing on those that have sepsis or MODS (50, 51) . In these models of research, clusters of genes are examined for similarity of response and highlighted, where the differences between individual patients are either ignored or not studied.",

A typical cohort of PICU patients presenting MODS, as shown in this paper, is composed of broad etiology of disease, including diverse environmental contributions and various infections. As the case reviews of these patients show, multiple factors are also identified in many of these patients, from genetics and infection to multiple infections sometimes in each patient. Even within an extensive cohort collection, the combinations that give rise to pathologies in each patient are likely such that no two patients present the same. In this work, we show how the collection of blood samples into the PAXgene tube system, followed by reduced ribosomal RNAseq can elucidate MODS understanding using outlier mapping strategies. The information collected from transcriptomics reveals a remarkable ability to map pathologies and understand the diverse biological responses seen within each patient in the PICU, which gains more insights as the cohorts of information grow. In the age of expanding sequencing technologies and precision medicine, this work highlights that it is important to consider how each patient is unique and to not lose this data by overly investing into cohort based patient assessments that tend to blind individual unique outcomes and mechanisms of pathology. This is further exemplified by viral outbreaks, such as COVID-19, showing selectivity in age and sex related vulnerability, inflammatory phenotypes leading to differences in presentation, severity, and management (4, 53) . These differences may result from common factors or could be contributed by unique biology that is challenging to capture in large cohorts, especially if there is no in-depth analysis in a patient-by-patient manner.",

This emerging field, labelled metagenomics, is still in the fledgling phase as we are trying to understand its clinical implications (54) . The potential for clinical relevance is undeniable, as we showed clinical overlap in multiple patients not only detecting viruses such as measles and EBV, but also bacteria confirmed by clinical tests and those that cannot be cultured well in clinical labs. The power of such findings is in the potential to guide clinical decisions on day 1 as shown by others through discovering unexpected infections (55) and antimicrobial choice (54).",

This will require blood draws from larger numbers of patients collected using similar protocols, but with a focus on understanding each patient instead of the entire cohort. Investments into larger datasets should lead to the scaling of bioinformatic tools that will delineate initiation events, patient responses, and determine when and why patients respond adversely. One limiting factor that needs to be surmounted is the current bottleneck by the time it takes to generate RNAseq data using existing platforms. Newer tools such as Nanopore hold the promise for speed to clinical care to transition from observational science, as in this study, into a tool that generates personalized/precision data in real-time, leading to the appropriate confirmatory clinical tests to guide decision making in the PICU.",

Pathways identified in Network Analyst to have variable gene expressions with an adjusted p-value (< 0.05) were extracted for Gene Ontology and KEGG associated genes. Pooling all day0 TPM values for transcripts, z-scores were calculated to identify day0 samples with greater than 2 standard deviations above the mean of all and a value >1 TPM. The biotype data for the transcripts in each of these samples >2 standard deviations were compared to the % of biotype annotations in the entire transcriptome to calculate transcript enrichment. The genes corresponding to the transcripts >2 standard deviations were assessed with STRING (60) for pathway enrichment. For patients with transcriptomes at day0 and day8, Log2 fold change was calculated for day0 relative to day8 on that patient and compared to day0 of the patient relative to day0 of all other patients. Neutrophil specific genes were taken from the LM22 matrix of CIBERSORTx (9, 12) and cytokines identified from protein annotations on UniProt for cytokines.
