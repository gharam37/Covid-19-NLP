It is a huge challenge to plan intervention strategies aimed at controlling outbreaks of COVID-19 in all countries, areas, or territories. Some key disease transmission parameters, including the basic reproduction number, the time-varying reproduction number, the generation interval (GI, time difference between being infected and infecting others), the serial interval (SI, the time difference between symptom onset of the infector and the infectee), and the incubation period (IP, the time difference between being infected and symptom onset), might offer insightful information of the epidemics and thus, might be helpful in devising interventions. In particular, the basic and time-varying reproduction numbers are good indicators of the speed of disease spreading and the effectiveness of interventions. Estimation of the basic and time-varying reproduction number often needs SI. In fact, for epidemics that are infectious during the incubation period, estimation of the reproduction numbers needs GI (Ganyani et al., 2020) . It is possible that COVID-19 is infectious during incubation period (Qian et al., 2020 , Wei et al., 2020 . Therefore, in this work, we will perform a statistical analysis of both GI and SI.",

Please see Table 1 for their estimated values and also the sample sizes. We find that the estimated values of SI from those previous studies are in a wide range: 3.95 \u2212 7.5 days for SI. However, an accurate estimation of SI (and GI) is crucial in calculating the reproduction numbers accurately. Therefore, in this work, we firstly want to provide a more accurate estimation of SI (and GI) with possibly larger sample sizes. Secondly, if possible, we also want to shine some light on why there can be such larger differences in the estimated value of SI.",

When working on determining the time-varying reproduction number of COVID-19 in China, we note that due to the different interventions for imported cases and local cases, their time-varying reproduction number should be different. Previously all analyses, as far as we know, have assumed that they are the same. See, for example, EpiEstim 2 ( Thompson et al., 2019) , which is a well-known R software on the estimation of time-varying reproduction number. For that, we need to distinguish the reported cases into the zeroth-generation imported cases X 0 , the first-generation locals infected by the imported cases X 1 , and so on, such as X 2 and X 3+ . From the transmission chains among those cases, we then find SI and GI between various generations, such as SI n n+1 and GI n n+1 , the SI and GI between the nth generation and the (n + 1)th generation.",

We call the former Hubei residents and the latter Hubei travelers. Note that here Hubei residents are the ones who have been living in Hubei for a long time but recently came out from Hubei to another province in China. The date of symptom onset is defined as the appearing date of symptoms relevant to COVID-19. The exposure date, which is needed for estimating GI, is estimated to be the middle of data for the earliest and latest possible exposure time for local cases and also for Hubei travelers. For Hubei residents, their exposure date is hard to find due to our lack of data on Hubei cases. Therefore, whenever the exposure date is needed, we discard our data on Hubei residents. We processed the interval-censored data in units of days and discarded non-positive values, which means, in the case of SI, the infector show symptoms latter than the infectee. This assumption might well be the truth or due to some error in data collection, especially when the infector and the infectee are from the same household. We did find many cases with non-positive values are from the same household. We decide not to use those non-positive data since it is hard to tell who the infector is between the pairs in the same household. Finally, we obtained 337 COVID-19 transmission events, and we named this dataset as \"All\". Then, we divided the \"All\" data into three subsets: Imported-first subsets E 0 1 , local first-second subsets E 1 2 , local second-third plus subsets E 2+ 3+ . E 0 1 are composed of the events that imported cases X 0 infect local first-generation cases X 1 , and others are defined accordingly. From these transmission chains, we get SI and GI for various generations. A Bayesian approach with doubly interval-censored likelihood (Reich et al., 2009 ) is then employed to obtain estimates of serial interval distribution, generation interval distribution, and incubation period distribution using the CmdStan package in R.",

(2020) pointed out that with more and more infective cases, it is more probable an earlier infection will happen if there are pre-symptomatic transmissions.

Often people use SI as a proxy of GI as the time of infection is not often reported in case files. In principle, SI and GI should have equal expected values since the IP time for the infector and infectee should cancel out. Consequently, GI is less studied than SI. However, firstly GI and SI still might have different standard deviations even if they have the same mean. As we will see later, it turns out that for COVID-19, even the means of GI and SI are slightly different, and their standard deviations are clearly different. Secondly and more importantly, for epidemics with pre-symptomatic transmissions, one needs GI instead of SI since, even before the onset of symptoms, transmissions can occur already. It has recently shown that estimates of the reproduction number are biased if ignoring the difference between SI and GI (Leonhard et al., 2019) . Surprisingly, only very few papers have studied GI of COVID-19 (Ganyani et al., 2020) . In this work, we would like to add one more study of GI of COVID-19.",

Therefore, to estimate GIs, we only consider imported cases with travel history (i.e., to exclude the Hubei residents from the imported cases) and use the middle of their trips as their date of exposure since people can often remember much better the dates of their trips.
