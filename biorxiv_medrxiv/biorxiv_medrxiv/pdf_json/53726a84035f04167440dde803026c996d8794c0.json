The other immune escaping mechanism is inhibition of innate immune responses, inhibition of interferon recognition and signaling, immune modulation including membrane or nonstructural proteins (NS4a, NS4b, NS15), Viral mutations, Immune exhaustion, Immune deviation: TH2 bias [34] [35] [36] .

It was not reported to cause human disease until the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) occurred early in 2003, which infected about 8000 persons, with a case fatality of 9.5% 2 , Followed by Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) from 2012-2015, which infected about 2500 persons worldwide and a case fatality rate of 35% 2,3 . COVID-19, is a new strain that has not been identified among humans 4 and now become an epidemic proportion with growing number of cases rapidly from December 2019 to 571,678 globally, with 26,495 deaths as of 28 March 2020 5 . COVID-19 is a viral infection in the family of coronaviridae. The family includes viruses which are a positive sense, enveloped, non-segmented RNA virus in the genus of beta coronavirus with zoonotic origin first described in 1931 whereby first isolated from humans in 1960s 1 . The novel coronavirus, previously designated 2019-nCoV, was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China at 31 December 2019. On 31 December 2019, the first four cases of an acute respiratory syndrome with unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan City, China among people linked to a local seafood market 1, 3 . From 31 December 2019 through 3 January 2020, a total of 44 case-patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported to WHO from China. Within one month the outbreak spreaded to 19 countries with a total of 11, 791 confirmed cases and 213 deaths 4, 5 .",

COVID-19 causes an inflammatory response in the lower airway and led to lung injury to produce cytokine storm in the body, which may be associated with the critical condition among COVID-19 infected individuals 27 . Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, early high rise in the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed in SARS-CoV-2 28 , suggesting a potential similar cytokine stormmediated disease severity of COVID-19 infection 29, 30 . Effective innate immune response involves the action of interferon responses and its downstream cascade that culminates in controlling viral replication and induction of effective adaptive immune response sharing the same attachment receptor with SARS-CoV 31 .

At churches and University levels: Minimizing conferences and Sunday schools, avoiding movement along different places, avoid lecturing in classes and replace with alternative lecture methods, posting different posters that thought about the outbreak, preparing and distributing hand washing jars for the university community at the entry and exit and empowering the community on the usefulness of social distancing and on hand washing practices.
