Leaving the economy locked down 4 for a long time is its own catastrophe. An SIR-type model with clear parameters suitable for public 5 information, and both tracking and predictive capabilities which \"learns\" disease spread characteristics 6 rapidly as policy changes, suggests that a solution to the problem is a partial unlock. Case load can be 7 managed so as not to exceed critical resources such as ventilators, yet allow enough people to get sick 8 that herd immunity develops and a full unlock can be achieved in as little as five weeks from beginning 9 of implementation. The partial unlock could be for example 3 full working days per week. Given that 10 not all areas or individuals will respond, and travel and public gatherings are still unlikely, the partial 11 unlock might be 5 full working days per week. The model can be regionalized easily, and by 12 expediting the resolution of the pandemic in the U.S. medical equipment and volunteers, many of them 13 with already acquired immunity, can be made available to other countries. 14",

As the U.S. has ventilators per capita among the highest in the 62 world, and stands to suffer high economic damage, it is a logical place to attempt this strategy. If the 63 U.S. develops herd immunity, then it might choose to make some of its ventilators, and its production 64 capacity for more ventilators, available to other countries. At the current time the hoarding mentality 65 which arises from uncertainty is impairing the sharing of medical equipment and New York and Italy 66 plead for ventilators and masks, as other countries protest they need their own stockpiles.
