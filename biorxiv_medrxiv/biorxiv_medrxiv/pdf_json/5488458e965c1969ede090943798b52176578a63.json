Wang et al. [13] found that CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells decreased in COVID-19 patients, and severe cases had a lower level than mild cases. Other studies also mentioned that CD4+T and CD8+T cells decreased in the COVID-19 patients [8, 14] . However, whether there are changes in humoral immune function has not been studied yet. And the differences of lymphocyte subsets between the survival and the death patients with COVID-19 are rarely studied. COVID-19 may lead to hyperactivity of the inflammatory response, and suppression of the immune response. Changes in leukocyte subsets and immune function after SARS-CoV-2 infection may suggest immune status, but this is not well studied. The objective of the present case series was to compare the clinical characteristics, blood analyses, and immune functions features between the survivors and non-survivors. The predictive value of neutrophil, lymphocyte, and lymphocyte subsets at admission for mortality was also studied.",

The leukocyte counts of severe patients with COVID-19 were significantly higher than those of non-severe patients [8] [9] [10] . For the present patients with COVID-19, we found that neutrophil count was above the higher limitation of normal range in 12(85.71%) dead patients and an initial elevated neutrophil count was an independent risk factor of mortality.
