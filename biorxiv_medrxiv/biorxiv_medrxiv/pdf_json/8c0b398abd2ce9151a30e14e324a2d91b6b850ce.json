The tool also demonstrated its outstanding performance on an external validation set that was completely independent of the modeling process, with sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 0.9512, 0.9697, and 0.9595, respectively. Besides, 24 samples from overseas infected patients with COVID-19 were used to make an in-depth clinical assessment with accuracy of 0.9167.

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 1 can induce emerging acute respiratory illness by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is classified by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). 2 This enveloped RNA virus is the seventh member of the coronavirus family to infect humans belonging to lineage B of the genus betacoronavirus through deep sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. 3 The epidemic pneumonia has spread quickly and become a global public health concern. 4 After making careful assessment for COVID-19, the epidemic is classified as a pandemic due to the alarming spread of the infection and the severity of the disease in March 11, 2020 . 5 A large amount of practice and research show that the common clinical symptoms of the pneumonia are fever, cough, myalgia or fatigue. 6 And the characteristics of chest radiography or computed tomography (CT) are multiple mottling or ground-glass opacity. 7 According to these valuable experience and achievements, the seventh edition of a new coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan has jointly updated by two Chinese departments. The official guidelines emphasize that the use of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays for the detection of viral nucleic acid to diagnose the infected patients is still one of the main reference standards. 8 Although RNA of this coronavirus is the prime marker that can be detected in the early stage of infection, the high requirements of its testing technology and condition limit its positive rate to as about 30-50%. 9 This situation may imply that many patients with COVID-19 cannot be identified in time. 10 The situation may delay the isolation and treatment of infected patients and accelerate the spread of the epidemic due to the characteristic of human-to-human transmission. 11 Apart from this, some objective factors, such as complicated operation, time-consuming, easy to pollute, high cost and so on, further hinder the technology from exerting its due advantages on emergency prevention and control conditions. 12 Many clinicians strongly recommended the use of CT imaging in severe epidemic areas, however, the tardy method would present obvious abnormalities when the lung produced inflammatory or the tissue generated lesions. 13 At present, the combined detection of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody provides a fast and simple screening method, but the two substances are impossible to be detected in the window period of about two weeks. 14, 15 So this method can only be used as an effective supplement and auxiliary diagnosis of nucleic acid detection. 16 Until now, the quick diagnosis of COVID-19 patients in a large scale is still a major problem for global health concern. 17 Except for the laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, there are a large number of suspected patients and close contacts who need to be confirmed whether they are infected or not. 18 In this case, it is difficult to screen and identify the cases during the incubation period or subclinical infections, they have great potential to become super spreaders. 19 Although timely isolation measures can effectively cut down the spread of the virus, early diagnosis can enable patients to get more active treatment at the initial stage of presentation. 20 Therefore, the early identification and timely management of COVID-19 patients is of great importance due to no specific treatment. 21 .

Moreover, the deep relationship between these important reference targets and COVID-19 could help to monitor the progress of the disease and to guide useful strategies for clinicians.

The whole process could be divided into three stepwise stages. In the first stage, all the parameters were fully employed to build the model in order to evaluate the importance of each parameter. In the second stage, while the top-ranking parameters were increased one by one, different models were built under the adjustment of RF parameters including the tree number (ntree) and the number of randomly selected features to split at each node (mtry). The adjustment range of ntree ranged from 500 to 1500 with a step of 100; Once the value of ntree was fixed, mtry spanned from 2 to 15 via a step of 1. In the last stage, based on the principle that the minimum number of top-ranking parameters could have comparable performance with the whole parameters, the appropriate number of parameters, ntree, and mtry were selected respectively.

The pneumonia samples in training set and test set were collected from the First Hospital of Lanzhou University, the First People's Hospital of Lanzhou City, and Gansu Provincial Hospital. The pneumonia samples in external validation set were from Lanzhou University Second Hospital. The tuberculosis and lung cancer samples were also collected from Lanzhou University Second Hospital. Clinical data collection from patients was approved by Ethics Committee of the First Hospital of Lanzhou University which is the leading department for this project.",

Among these samples, 39 of 40 samples with COVID-19, 13 of 14 samples with common pneumonia, 10 of 10 samples with tuberculosis, and 9 of 10 samples with lung cancer were accurately identified. Overall, the sensitivity reached 39/(39+1+1) = 0\u00b7 9512, the specificity reached 32/(32+1) = 0\u00b7 9697, and the total accuracy reached 0\u00b7 9595. These results indicated that the assistant tool might have a high resolution on distinguishing patients with COVID-19 from the complex disease condition. It suggested that the technology had great potential to develop into a powerful assistant tool for large-scale detection of the highly infectious disease.",
