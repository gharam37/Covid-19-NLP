Although PCR provides a relatively rapid result, it is limited by the bottle necks of transportation to the laboratory and the requirement to batch samples in a large run. Moreover, alternative technologies to RT-PCR requiring different reagents, and dry swabs would reduce the strain on laboratory and clinical supplies, allowing greater numbers of tests to be performed. It is abundantly clear that urgent research is needed to enable health services globally to plan resources and this research must both move rapidly from bench to bedside and be scalable and rapidly available. In light of this urgency, we present a preliminary evaluation of a novel, quick test for COVID-19 that can be implemented at the point of need.",

There is currently no \"real world data\" comparing the effectiveness of RT-LAMP to the current gold standard of RT-PCR but lab-based studies in China and the USA suggest these methods have similar theoretical efficacy. Added Value of this study: Magnetic bead capture and RT-LAMP amplification and testing for SARS-CoV-2 was found to be promising, easy to use and to work equivalently to RT-PCR methods in a \"real world\" cohort of patients in a care home. Hypothermia is a notable clinical sign in our cohort for patients with Covid-19 infection, and consideration should be given to its inclusion in diagnostic criteria as an alternative to fever Implications of all the available evidence: RT-LAMP can be used to aid rapid diagnosis for COVID-19 at the point of care in community settings, allowing RT-PCR to be reserved for use elsewhere. Hypothermia, in addition or contrast to fever, may also be a significant early clinical sign of COVID-19 disease, and further investigation is recommended for its use in clinical practice.",

The RT-LAMP method employed was the MicrosensDx RapiPrep\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 research use test. The method used magnetic bead capture to maximise the yield of target nucleic acid during sample preparation from the dry swab, which is followed by optimised reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to amplify and detect the SARS-CoV-2 genome, targeting the ORF1a gene. The assay runs under isothermal conditions at 65oC allowing simpler and cheaper instrumentation which can yield results in 25 minutes on average. Results from this assay were compared to multiplex tandem PCR performed twice in the case of negative patients.",

To this end we present data from 21 patients in a care home tested within days of an outbreak in the home. In this patient group, a single RT-LAMP test had a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 73% compared to a \"better than gold standard\" of two consecutive RT-PCR swabs. This level of sensitivity is clinically workable in a time of crisis, particularly if repeated testing is utilised, and safeguards are put in place to guard against over confidence in negative individuals. It is comparable to other estimates of a single-swab RT-PCR test in our clinical experience and in published pre-prints [7, 8] . In addition, it appears nasal swabs are second best to lower respiratory tract derived samples [8] . Combined with the rapid result time, RT-LAMP may have additional clinical utility to standard RT-PCR. The RT-PCR negative, RT-LAMP positive samples may indicate a lack of specificity of the RT-LAMP assay but given that some infected patients are assumed to be have been clinically asymptomatic and given that the RT-LAMP assay used here tests more of the swab eluate than the PCR, these may be real positive results that have missed by the RT-PCR. Further testing and further studies will resolve this issue.",

Within the past 4-6 weeks, five independent groups have published preprints of submitted manuscripts evaluating novel RT-LAMP testing methods against RT-PCR as gold standard ( Table 4 ). Two of these used only proven PCR-positive throat and nasal swabs and demonstrated sensitivity >97% for RT-LAMP methods targeting the ORF1ab gene when compared with gold standard RT-PCR [11, 12] . Only the study by Yang et al. included swabs from both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients and was thus able to produce both a sensitivity and a specificity. The remaining two groups, both based in in the United States, lacked access to, or clearance to work with, SARS-CoV-2 samples and used either inactivated HIV with synthesised LAMP sequences [13] or other synthesised RT-LAMP sequences [14] . The majority of studies focused on the highly-conserved ORF1ab gene primer, also targeted by the RT-LAMP method used by the MicrosensDx RapiPrep\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 method. Our study is the first \"real world\" study comparing the effectiveness of RT-PCR and RT-LAMP testing in a group of patients at high risk for COVID-19 and represents an important progression to clinical use for this novel SARS-CoV-2 testing method. Of particular note, our standard for comparison was not a single RT-PCR, but two separate swabs for RT-PCR sent on consecutive days, thus representing what could be considered a \"better-than gold standard\" for comparison.",

Swabs were taken by the same clinician, minimising the risk of technical error or observer biases. All RT-LAMP samples were tested in the MicrosensDx laboratory, and RT-PCR in the hospital laboratory, and there was no viral transport medium on the RT-LAMP swabs. Actual Point of Care testing, and or viral medium could be used to optimise performance further but use of dry swabs could ease issues with supply of viral transport media. We are limited by a small sample size, so our estimates have wide confidence intervals. However, they appear to be concordant with other (pre-print) studies on RT-LAMP performed purely on laboratory samples. A further possible limitation of our study is that only upper respiratory samples were used. Additional work is needed to test this method with sputum or bronchiolar lavage specimens, which may improve sensitivity for hospitalised patients. We are also aware that sampling sites were different on Day 3 and 4, however discordant patients had deep nasal samples on Day 4, and this does not appear to have affected our results.",
