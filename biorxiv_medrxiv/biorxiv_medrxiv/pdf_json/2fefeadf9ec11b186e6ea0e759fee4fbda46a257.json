In the United Kingdom, the death toll has reached 12,000, while almost 100,000 people have been diagnosed with the virus. 1 The novel coronavirus is directly claiming lives, but the whole unprecedented situation and the lockdown imposed in the UK and other countries might be triggering other effects. People with other, unrelated health conditions may be reluctant to visit their GP or a hospital in order to avoid the risk of contracting the virus.2 Furthermore, to increase capacity for the overstretched NHS, routine operations have been postponed.3 While these do not concern life-threatening conditions, this gives an indication that the covid-19 pandemic has been attracting resources from the treatment of other conditions. While more ICUs and ventilators have been made available, the NHS may reach its capacity at the peak of the pandemic, which can affect patients suffering from other conditions. Furthermore, the lockdown may also have unintended health effects. Lack of social contact can affect mental health,4 and big events or disasters at the national level can have a similar impact.5 Staying at home can limit physical activity, which is associated with obesity6 and mental health.7 Furthermore, staying at home and bar and restaurant closure may affect other health-related behaviours, such as drinking, smoking and diet. There are also reports of a rise in domestic abuse,8 while the current financial and public health situation may also cause additional uncertainty and stress. [9] [10] Apart from the negative effects, there may also be some improvement in certain areas.",

Data were reported by sex, age group and Region. I used the total number of deaths as well as the number of deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, in order to calculate the number of deaths that were not (at least officially) attributed to Covid-19. Data on Covid-19 deaths are also provided by the Department of Health and Social Care,13 but these exclude deaths that occurred outside hospital. The aim was to see whether there was any unexpected change in the number deaths for people who had not contracted the virus, in the current situation. It is worth noting that according to the data source, data by sex or age group may be incomplete, so they might not sum to the total number of deaths.",

            "text": "Looking at trends in a variable alone before and after a \"treatment\" can be misleading as there may be other factors driving any change. For that purpose, a control group can help filter out any other effects. Such a control group will have to remain unaffected by the treatment. The covid-19 pandemic is a major global crisis, involving over 120,000 deaths so far and a lockdown in many countries, so identifying a control group for the same period seems impossible. Instead, I follow an approach similar to that by Metcalfe et al5 who used trends in the same variable in the year before as a control group. Similarly, I used deaths in the first 14 weeks in 2019 as a control group for non-covid-19 deaths in the 14 first weeks in 2020. In addition, in one of the graphs I also used the average number of deaths in the previous five years, which is, however, subject to changes in medical technology and other factors that may affect mortality, particularly any type of mortality that may demonstrate seasonal effects, as well as changes in the population. Population data for 2020 by demographic group are yet to be released.14 In addition to a graphical analysis comparing trends in deaths excluding covid-19 deaths in every week so far in 2020 to the control group, I also used a differences-in-differences (D-I-D) econometric approach. The dependent variable is the number of deaths in each of the 14 first weeks of 2020 and 2019, excluding any deaths that mentioned covid-19 in the death certificate. In other words, deaths of people who suffered from covid-19 are not included in the analysis, in order to study any spillover effects on other deaths. A differences-in-differences approach includes a treatment group dummy variable, which takes the value of 1 for the group that is affected by the intervention, and zero otherwise. In this case, observations in 2020 take the value of 1, and observations in 2019 take the value of zero. Another dummy that is included is an \"after\" variable, which takes the value of 1 in the period after an intervention (for both groups, 2019 and 2020), and zero otherwise. We consider the treatment period to start in week 10, as that is the week when the first covid-19 death was reported, thus indicating an escalating situation and capturing any spillover effects of the virus. One might argue that the treatment period should start later, when the number of deaths started increasing steeply, but a question that remains is where we should draw the line, and this would possibly relate with the cause of any spillover effects on the number of deaths, which is currently unknownso identifying where the treatment period should start becomes particularly challenging. The interaction of these two dummy variables (treatment*after) is the main variable of interest. I also used region fixed effects, depending on the model, as well as a variable for sex and/or dummies for each age group. Robust standard errors were used in all regressions. A differences-in-differences approach requires that the common trend assumption is met. This may not always be the case, .

I recognise this issue and seek ways to find a better control group for the next update. In the meantime, to partly address this issue, apart from including all 14 weeks in the econometric analysis, I also perform the same analysis using only weeks 6-14. Restricting the period decreases the likelihood of having spikes in the data due to some seasonal cause of death, such as a bad flu season.16 Using a shorter period as an additional check allows us to focus on the particular weeks just before and just after the treatment.",

Trends by sex are reported in Figure 3 , where again, for both females and males, there is a spike in non-Covid-19 deaths in week 14, 2020, compared to the same week in 2019. This, however, follows from a relative decrease in week 13. Figure 4 provides a breakdown by age group and sex. For all age groups over 44, for both females and males, there is a spike in non-covid-19 deaths in week 14, 2020, compared to 2019, but nothing similar in the weeks before.

This increase is persistent for most sub-group analyses, by sex, most age groups and regions. However, there are two important points to take into account. First, while the percentage difference between 2020 and 2019 reaches its peak in week 14 of the year, there were weeks prior to the coronavirus outbreak that also demonstrated higher number of deaths compared to the control year. Second, there is an absolute and relative dip in non-covid-19 deaths in week 13 of the current year, well into the pandemic, when there were already 2,000 covid-19 deaths in England and Wales.",
