Our department delivers an average of 10-15 SBRT treatments per day, the majority of which take place on a specialty stereotactic treatment unit, Edge (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). The typical workflow of coverage is as follows. The patient is set up on the table to marks by the therapy team, and a CBCT is obtained with initial positional match performed by the therapists. The physician is then called and verifies the setup, the shift is sent, and the physician verifies all subsequent images (kV/kV, fluoroscopy, etc) prior to delivery.

Despite a low comfort level, we were able to correctly identify that the physician was needed at the machine and had minimal wait time for the physician to be present (approximately a minute or less). In the future, we look to identify cases where remote SBRT coverage may be challenging, such as first fraction abdominal gating cases or for lesions that have high potential for poor detectability even if in person (e.g. peridiaphragmatic lung lesions). Additional time-outs during this process are necessary to ensure physicians have all needed information. Ordinarily, time out is performed before the patient is placed on the table and again when physician arrives for coverage. With in-person coverage, the physician has the opportunity to pull up patient charts and supplementary imaging alongside the treatment console on a separate computer from the Microsoft Teams computer. In the remote setting, especially by mobile app, a second time-out to transmit this information about the case to the physician is critical. Having available resources at the ready, including prior fraction notes, planning scans, etc. to answer whatever questions that the physician has may be helpful. Additional challenges include the greater importance of using direct verbal communication, as common non-verbal cues are lost with remote coverage.
