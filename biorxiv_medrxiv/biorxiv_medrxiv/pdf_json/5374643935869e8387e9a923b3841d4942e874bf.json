It is important to study 3 the host range of SARS-CoV-2 because some domestic species might harbor the virus and transmit it 4 back to humans. In addition, insight into the ability of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like viruses to utilize 5 animal orthologs of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 might provide structural insight into improving 6 ACE2-based viral entry inhibitors. Here we show that ACE2 orthologs of a wide range of domestic 7 and wild animals support entry of SARS-CoV-2, as well as that of SARS-CoV-1, bat coronavirus 8 RaTG13, and a coronavirus isolated from pangolins. Some of these species, including camels, cattle, 9 horses, goats, sheep, pigs, cats, and rabbits may serve as potential intermediate hosts for new human 10 transmission, and rabbits in particular may serve as a useful experimental model of COVID-19. We 11 show that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 entry could be potently blocked by recombinant IgG Fc-12 fusion proteins of viral spike protein receptor-binding domains (RBD-Fc) and soluble ACE2 (ACE2-13 Fc). Moreover, an ACE2-Fc variant, which carries a D30E mutation and has ACE2 truncated at its 14 residue 740 but not 615, outperforms all the other ACE2-Fc variants on blocking entry of both viruses.",

Bats 21 are considered to be the natural reservoir hosts for a number of pathogenic human coronaviruses, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.032342 doi: bioRxiv preprint animals also served as intermediate hosts that facilitated SARS-CoV-2 transmission from its natural 30 reservoir hosts to humans. 31 As of April 7 th 2020, the uncontrolled COVID-19 pandemic has already caused over 1,210,000 32 confirmed infections and over 67,000 documented deaths across 211 countries, according to World 33 Health Organization's online updates. There are currently no vaccines or targeted therapeutics 34 available for this disease 11 . It is therefore urgent to study the host range of SARS-CoV-2 because Receptor binding is a critical determinant for the host range of coronaviruses 6,12 . SARS-CoV-2 utilizes 39 ACE2, the SARS-CoV-1 receptor 13 , as an essential cellular receptor to infect cells 8, 14, 15 . Therefore, in 40 this study, we characterized seventeen ACE2 orthologs for their function to support entry of SARS- 41 CoV-2, as well as that of SARS-CoV-1, a bat coronavirus (Bat-CoV RaTG13) ref. 8 , and a coronavirus 42 recently isolated from Malayan pangolins (called Pangolin-CoV hereafter) 16 . Furthermore, to explore 43 broadly anti-coronavirus approaches to treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2, we evaluated 44 recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) variants of the viral spike proteins, and soluble ACE2 45 variants for their potency as entry inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1.",

Through analyzing ACE2 residues that are within 5 51 \u00c5 from SARS-CoV-2 RBD atoms, we found that these residues are highly conserved across the 52 seventeen analyzed ACE2 orthologs, including human ACE2 and ACE2 orthologs of sixteen domestic Pangolin-CoV, and SARS-CoV-1 BJ01 (Extended Data Fig. 2a) .

The flow cytometry data clearly show that, although 59 each of the four tested RBDs has a distinctive binding profile, they all can bind to a wide range of 60 ACE2 orthologs. Note that human ACE2 and ACE2 orthologs of all the domestic animals, except for 61 that of donkeys, guinea pigs, and chickens, support efficient binding to all the four tested RBDs. The 62 lack of any RBD binding to donkey ACE2 is likely due to a protein sequence defect, because 63 expression of the donkey ACE2 is detectable in 293T cells but a 22-residue fragment likely important 64 for ACE2 folding is missing in the Genbank sequence (Fig. 2c , and Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2b) . 65 These data suggest that ACE2 orthologs of domestic animals might be generally functional for 66 supporting cell entry of the four tested viruses.

We then 95 evaluated these proteins for their potency of blocking SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection. Among 96 all the RBD-Fc variants, the Y505W mutant of SARS-CoV-2 RBD showed modestly improved 97 potency over the wildtype, and wildtype RBD of Pangolin-CoV showed the best neutralization activity 98 among all the tested RBDs (Fig. 4b). Among the tested ACE2-Fc variants, interestingly, all the 740-99 version variants showed significantly better potency than the 615-version variants (two-tailed two-100 sample t-test, p<0.001; Fig. 4c). In addition, D30E mutants of both 615-and 740-version proteins 101showed improved potency over the corresponding wildtypes(Fig. 4c). We further tested three of the 102RBD-Fc variants and four of the ACE2-Fc variants for their neutralization activities against SARS-103CoV-1 and observed similar results, except that D30E mutation did not show any improvement on the 104 neutralization potency against this virus(Figs. 4d and e). Consistently, cell-surface ACE2 carrying 105 this D30E mutation binds SARS-CoV-2 RBD better than the wildtype ACE2 does, and this enhanced 106 binding was not observed with SARS-CoV-1 RBD(Extended Data Fig. 4c). Thus, the mechanism 107 of the D30E-mediated improvement is likely that the mutation enhances the salt-bridge interaction 108 between the residue 30 of the ACE2 and residue 417 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD(Fig. 4f), because this 109 interaction is only present in the ACE2 complex with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 but not that of SARS-110 CoV-1 ref.17-19 .",

Human ACE2 transgenic mice have been123    shown to support SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lung, lose weight early after infection and then124 develop anti-spike IgG immune responses 22 . However, the expression patterns of a constitutively 125 expressed ACE2 transgene may not fully follow the patterns of endogenous ACE2 gene. There are also 126 major differences between mice and humans in immune responses against pathogens, with immune 127 resistance dominant in humans but tolerance mechanisms dominant in mice 23 . Therefore, it's 128 necessary to find better model animals, which can use endogenous ACE2 to support SARS-CoV-2 129 infection and whose immune systems better mimic human's. Our finding that rabbit ACE2 efficiently 130 supports binding and entry of the tested diverse coronaviruses suggests that rabbits may serve as a new 131 model animal of COVID-19, as well as that of SARS and diseases caused by other SARS-related 132 coronaviruses. 133 Although in urgent needs, vaccines and targeted therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infections are not 134 available yet 11 . More importantly, anti-spike IgG, either passively administered or vaccine-induced, 135 was also found to cause severe acute lung injury during acute SARS-CoV infection\uff0clikely through 136 an antibody-dependent enhancement mechanism 24,25 . Thus, in addition to pursuing traditional 137 vaccination strategies and isolation of fully human anti-spike IgG antibodies from convalescent-phase 138 patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), alternative approaches to prevention and 139 treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection should also be explored. Here we found that four diverse SARS-140 like coronaviruses can efficiently utilize ACE2 for entry, and that both RBD-Fc and ACE2-Fc proteins, 141 in particular the 740-version of ACE2-Fc and its D30E mutant, potently blocked entry of both SARS-142 CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1. These data provide very encouraging evidence that these proteins might be 143 developed as effective prophylactic and therapeutic agents against infection of SARS-CoV-2 and any 144 new viral variants that emerge over the course of the pandemic.",
