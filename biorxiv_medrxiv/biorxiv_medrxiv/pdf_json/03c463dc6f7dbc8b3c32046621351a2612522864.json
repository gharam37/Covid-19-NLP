The predicted percentage of untested infected individuals depends on the specific outbreak but we found that they typically represent 50% to 80% of the infected individuals. Even when unreported cases are taken into account, we estimate that less than 8% of the population would have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by 09/04/2020 in the analysed outbreaks. These levels are far from the 70-85% needed to ensure herd immunity and we predict a resurgence of infection if ongoing lockdowns in the analysed outbreaks are fully lifted. We propose that partially lifted lockdowns together with fast and thorough testing allowing for quick isolation of both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases could lead to suppression of secondary waves of COVID-19 epidemics.",

Underreporting of infections may depend on the testing ability of different countries and the presence of asymptomatic infected individuals [7] [8] [9] . There is no consensus on the proportion of unreported cases and their potential impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. For instance, a World Health Organization report in February suggested that \"the proportion of truly asymptomatic infections is unclear but appears to be relatively rare and does not appear to be a major driver of transmission\" 10 . Studies testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals [7] [8] [9] , however, suggest that asymptomatic carriers can represent 50% or more of the cases. In many countries that mostly test individuals when they have symptoms, unreported infections are likely to include at least most of the asymptomatic individuals or those with mild symptoms. Such individuals can act as silent carriers for SARS-CoV-2 and have been suggested as a key factor promoting the rapid spread of the virus 11 , similar to what has been observed in other infectious diseases 12 . On the positive side, if recovery from infection leads to immunity, one could hope that untested positive individuals could significantly contribute to the build-up of herd immunity in the population 13, 14 . It is not clear to what extent this could be the case. The importance of silent carriers on interventions for mitigation and suppression 15 of the infection is not clear either.",

Hubei follows Germany in terms of testing, followed by Spain, Italy and the UK. Our prediction for Hubei is not far from the 65% reporting rate estimated by Li et al. 11 for China in the period considered here. The high testing rate predicted for Germany agrees with the known high testing capacity in this country 27 . Taking the confidence intervals into account, we estimate that for each infected individual tested in the UK, there could have been between 2 and 10 untested infected individuals. At the other end of the testing spectrum, we estimate that for each infected individual tested in Germany, between 0.2 and 2 individuals might have not been tested at the beginning of the epidemic. A higher testing rate for Germany is in qualitative agreement with estimates given elsewhere 22, 26 . Our estimates for the reporting rate, however, tend to be higher than those obtained by Jagodnik et al. 26 and the differences we found between countries are not as extreme as those given by Chicci et al. 22 Assuming that the testing rate remains constant during the course of epidemics and no control interventions are implemented, our model predicts that the number of tested and untested infected individuals would evolve in parallel in all the studied outbreaks which would last for around 12 weeks in all cases (see Figure 3 ). We see, however, that the epidemic in Germany would belong to a different class in the sense that the number of untested infected individuals remains smaller than the number of tested individuals during the whole epidemic. Italy, Spain and UK exhibit the opposite behaviour with more untested than tested individuals. For Hubei, we predict similar levels of untested and tested rates. Obviously, these predictions will not be fulfilled since control interventions are imposed in all these countries and testing strategies might change during the pandemic.",

This might be a combined effect of the fact that infected individuals in this country were relatively young at the beginning of the outbreak 28 and the high testing rate. On the one hand, the COVID-19 fatality rate is lower for the younger than for the elderly 29 . On the other hand, the higher the testing rate, the more individuals with mild symptoms will be included in the tested infected compartment of our model. The lower death rate of individuals with mild symptoms will lead to an effectively lower death rate for the whole set of infected individuals in this compartment. We note that the specific value of for a country does not fully determine the expected fraction of deaths in the country. Indeed, we found that the predicted fraction of deaths by the end of unmitigated epidemics is not too different for different countries (medians are as follows: 0.4% for Germany, 0.9% for Hubei, 0.5% for Italy, 0.8% for Spain and 0.3% for UK).",

The same is likely to occur in other countries. In fact, resurgence of the disease is predicted even for much longer lockdowns. This is due to the fact that an early lockdown delays the spread but does not lead to herd immunity. Assuming that recovered individuals are immune to SARS-CoV-2, herd immunity is only achieved when a proportion 1 \u2212 1/\u211b 0 of the susceptible population has been infected and died or recovered. Even if the number of untested individuals that may have recovered are taken into account, we estimate that, as of 09/04/2020, the the proportion of the susceptible population that has been exposed to the virus (i.e. the attack rate, see Methods) is 0.65% [90% CI: 0.46%-1.18%] for Germany, 0.5% [0.3%-1.0%] for Hubei, 4.6% [3.3%-7.2%] for Italy, 3.7% [2.0%-6.4%] for Spain and 4.4% [2.7%-6.9%] for the UK. These proportions are small compared to the 70-85% needed to ensure herd immunity for these epidemics. Our conclusion is in qualitative agreement with the results by Flaxman et al. 3 despite the fact that their estimates for the attack rate tend to be higher than ours. Our conclusions, however, disagree with Louren\u00e7o et al. 14 that predicted much higher attack rates that would be close to herd immunity. .

Interventions are parametrised by the fraction of tested (untested) infected individuals that are randomly selected to be isolated, ( ), and the rate at which they are isolated after testing/reporting. Isolation strategies leading to eradication of infection satisfy the condition \u211b 0 < 1, where \u211b 0 is the reproduction number for Model 2 (see Eq. (6) in Methods). Given the significant reporting delays we found, isolation has to be fast after testing positive. In particular, we found that isolation after an average time of \u22121 = 1 day could only lead to eradication in Germany; for other countries, \u211b 0 remains larger than 1 for any and . Following this, in Figure 6 we show results for a scenario in which individuals are isolated after an average time of \u22121 = 1/2 days. In this case, eradication is possible in all the studied countries if both and are large enough, i.e. if enough tested and untested cases are isolated. The estimated boundaries separating the eradication region (\u211b 0 < 1) from the epidemic region (\u211b 0 > 1) are different for different countries but differences are statistically less marked if confidence intervals are taken into account.",

The first, involves the existence of a significant proportion of cases that are not tested and may act as silent carriers of the infection. We found that the predicted percentage of untested infected individuals may represent 50% to 80% of the cases in Germany, Hubei, Italy, Spain and the UK. The specific percentage depends on the country and we found the lowest proportion of unreported cases in Germany. Based on studies in Iceland 9 and the Diamond Princess cruise 7 , we conclude that asymptomatic infected individuals are likely to be the main contribution to the untested cases in all analysed outbreaks but a fraction of cases with mild symptoms are also likely to be untested. Even when unreported cases are taken into account, we estimate that less than 8% of the population would have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by 09/04/2020 in the analysed outbreaks. In policy terms, our results demonstrate that the current suppression strategies being employed in Germany, Hubei, Italy, Spain and the UK will not facilitate sufficient levels of herd immunity in the population that would control and eventually eradicate the virus. This leaves the risk of re-emergence of the virus once suppression strategies are lifted, similar to second waves of infection observed in 1918 influenza epidemics 34 .

We made several simplifying assumptions in the models. In particular, spatial and age heterogeneities were ignored. However, it is known that there is both spatial heterogeneity within the populations 36 (e.g. cities and rural areas) as well as differences in both susceptibility and mortality across different age and vulnerability groups 29, 37 . Another limitation of our approach is that it assumes that the transition times between compartments are exponentially distributed. This memory-less assumption is usual for classical compartmental models 17 . For COVID-19, however, transitions between compartments are better described in terms of gamma distributions 3,29 and using models with memory would provide a more precise description of the dynamics 3, 17, 38 . In addition, our model is limited in terms of the specific ways to make interventions operational. For instance, reductions in transmission are treated at a generic level without specifying if they could be achieved by enhanced social distancing, school closure, etc. Accounting for such details would require using individual-based simulations 15 .",
