The pandemic has resulting in an overwhelming and unprecedented workload on healthcare systems across the world. Consequently, most governments are contemplating training medical students to cater to the increase demand. Understanding the knowledge, attitude and practices amongst undergraduate medical students could be the first step towards identifying areas of potential need for devising a structured training programme in preparedness for the coming times. A survey was thus designed for the same.",

The average time taken by reach individual to complete the survey was eight minutes. The respondents could change the answers before submission but not after it. All questions were mandatory. Internet Protocol address checks were done to avoid duplicated responses from a single respondent. Three professors and one undergraduate medical student reviewed the questions and confirmed them to be representative of the content validity of the survey. The survey underwent three rounds of cross-fill to check for errors in wording, grammar or syntax. Correct responses were obtained from the Centre of Disease Control [10] .",
