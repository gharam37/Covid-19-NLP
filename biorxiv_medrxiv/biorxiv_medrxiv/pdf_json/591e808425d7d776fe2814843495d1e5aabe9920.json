ARDS mortality is approximately 35-40% depending on the severity of the disorder [1] . The treatment of ARDS still relies on the management of the underlying disease and supportive care since pharmacological interventions targeting key pathophysiological determinants of ARDS are still not available [2] . The key pathophysiological event of ARDS is an uncontrolled inflammatory response resulting in injury of the endothelialalveolar barrier with increased pulmonary vascular leakage [1, 3] .",

CD73 is an enzyme controlling endothelial barrier function and leucocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation via the production of adenosine [5] [6] [7] , a highly antiinflammatory substance having cardioprotective, neuroprotective, vasodilatory and angiogenic properties [8] . A phase II trial showed that upregulation of CD73 via intravenous administration of recombinant human interferon is associated with a reduction in 28-day mortality in ARDS [9] . A following placebo-controlled phase III trial (INTEREST) showed that intravenous recombinant human interferon beta-1a did not improve outcome in patients with ARDS [10] . However, the study showed that use of corticosteroids at baseline was higher than 50% and post-hoc analyses revealed a statistically significant interaction between baseline corticosteroids and the treatment group [10] .",

To further confirm these findings, we isolated the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the pulmonary endothelial cells and analyzed them separately for IRF9 by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting (Fig 2d) .

Adenosine is one of the physiological regulators of endothelial cell permeability and accelerates alveolar fluid reabsorption and inhibits leukocyte recruitment [24] . Although a previous study has shown that steroids inhibit the effect of type I IFN signaling in asthmatic epithelium [13] , the use of corticosteroids was unexpectedly high (64.5% in placebo and 54.2% in the IFN beta-1a group) in the INTEREST study. Therefore, the present analyses focused on the possible interaction between steroids and IFN beta-1a in human pulmonary endothelium and CD73 expression, which a key enzyme for local adenosine production and vascular integrity. We found a significant increase in the risk of death for the baseline systemic glucocorticoid treatment and for glucocorticoid use overlapping with the IFN beta-1a treatment (Table 3) . Since type I IFNs (IFN beta and alpha) are endogenously produced and are of utmost importance to fight against infections (bacterial and viral) [4] , these observations may explain the fact that glucocorticoid use for patients with virus triggered ARDS is associated with an increased risk of death [16] . In line with these interpretations, others have shown that the use of recombinant human IFN beta inhibits SARS virus replication and has antiviral potential even after infection [25] .",

As there are more than 7300 type 1 interferon responsive genes (http://www.interferome.org/interferome/site/dbStat.jspx) the effects of glucocorticoids are extensive already when taken only their targeting of type 1 IFN signaling pathways into account. In addition, glucocorticoids inhibit the production and secretion of type I IFNs themselves [30] . We used hydrocortisone in ex vivo experiments as it is commonly used in clinical practice. Although glucocorticoids have different potencies, they all act via the glucocorticoid receptor and affect the same signaling pathways [31] , thus the obtained effects are expected to be generalized to all glucocorticoids used to treat ARDS patients.",

In addition, HIF-1a mediated transactivation of genes may also be impacted as glucocorticoids induce the phosphorylation of GRIP1 [33] , a normal interaction required for HIF-1a mediated gene transactivation. These earlier data together with our ex vivo results utilizing hydrocortisone together with IFN beta-1a demonstrate that glucocorticoids interfere with the production of CD73, since the gene encoding for CD73 contains response elements for interferons (ISRE) and hypoxia (HRE) [34, 35] .",
