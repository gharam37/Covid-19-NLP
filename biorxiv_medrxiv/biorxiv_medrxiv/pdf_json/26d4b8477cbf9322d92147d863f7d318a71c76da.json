We modeled the Covid-19 outbreak in Italian Regions vs. Lombardy to assess the epidemics progression and predict peaks of new daily infections and total cases by learning from the entire Chinese epidemiological dynamics. We trained an artificial neural network model, a modified autoencoder with Covid-19 Chinese data, to forecast epidemic curve of the different Italian regions, and use the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading and peaks. We have estimated the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) -which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection -both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period, and also by using a day by day assessment, based on single observations. Results. The expected peak of SEIR model for new daily cases was at the end of March at national level. The peak of overall positive cases is expected by April 11 th in Southern Italian Regions, a couple of days after that of Lombardy and Northern regions. According to our model, total confirmed cases in all Italy regions could reach 160,000 cases by April 30 th and stabilize at a plateau. Conclusions. Training neural networks on Chinese data and use the knowledge to forecast Italian spreading of Covid-19 has resulted in a good fit, measured with the mean average precision between official Italian data and the forecast.",

[7] About 53% of cases are males (median age: 62 years old). Detailed epidemiological figures are provided by the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) and tell us that men represent the majority of cases in people aged 0-9 and 50-79 (range 52-63%), while in the younger age groups 0-19, as well as between 80 and 89 years old, males and females are equally represented among people who tested positive for Covid-19. Women accounted for 70% of cases >90 years old and about 55% between 20 and 39 years of age, but men represented also the vast majority of deceased people in all the age groups up to 89 years old (range 57-79%). [7] Regional figures are available up to April 8 th and show that about 30% (n=28,545) of currently positive people still live in Lombardy (56% if considering the overall cases confirmed from the beginning of the epidemic), followed by Emilia Romagna (13.7% of currently positive people), Piedmont (11.5%), Veneto (n=10.7%), Tuscany (5.8%), Marche (3.7%), Lazio (n=3.6%), Liguria and Trentino Alto Adige (3.4%), Campania and Apulia (3%), Sicily (2%), Friuli Venezia Giulia and Abruzzo (1.5%), and less than 1% in Umbria, Sardinia, Calabria, Val d'Aosta, Basilicata, and Molise. [7] A total of 28,485 symptomatic people were hospitalized at the same date of April 8 th With the exception of Lazio (n=196), Campania (n=97) and Apulia (n=90), all the other regions of Central and Southern Italy, at the moment have less than 65 patients admitted to the ICUs of their regional healthcare systems.

Therefore, we applied a Modified Auto-Encoder (MAE) for a time-series forecast in order to predict the evolution of daily cases for each of the 21 regions of Italy. [15] The model was trained with the data from the Chinese regions, which provides complete data in the sense that they already went through the peak number of daily cases and managed to suppress the epidemic by social distancing measures. Although such measures implemented by the Chinese government may be impossible to implement in other countries or may not be as effective as it was in China, the data generated by their experience going through the epidemic can be used to derive data-oriented models to predict the epidemic dynamic behavior in other countries. The forecast of new daily cases has been used to correctly estimate the single peaks but also to obtain better spreading predictions from SEIR model. We modeled spreading of Covid-19 using Chinese data and used the model ",

This stu makes use of the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model [4] to predict t spreading of the pandemic in Italy. Our efforts could be helpfulin the adoption of all the possib preventive measures, and to study of the epidemics progression across Southern regions as opposed to t national trend. This metric can be biased by the optimal estimation of the basic reproductive number (pronounced R-nought). It must be said that R 0 is important if correlated with weather conditions and th reproductive index is reduced as the air temperature and relative humidity increase, [5] according to t formula: author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

            "text": "R 0 is an average value, but it can be also computed day by day to monitor the transmission of the infection. Being an average value, it can be skewed by super-spreader events. A super-spreader is an infected individual who infects an unexpectedly large number of people. In Italy this event can be also generated not necessarily by an individual, but from the perturbation of a susceptible population, as it happened in Apulia and Sicily with uncontrolled large group of people coming from outbreak areas. For a \"super spreader\" individual, such events are not necessarily a bad sign, because they can indicate that fewer people are perpetuating an epidemic. Super-spreaders may also be easier to identify and contain, since their symptoms are likely to be more severe. In short, R 0 is a moving target. Tracking every case and the transmission of a disease is extremely difficult, so the estimation of R 0 is a complex and challengingissue: estimates often change as new data becomes available. In [10] a review of 12 studies on the reproduction number for a time period covered from 1 January 2020 to 7 February 2020was analysed for Covid-19 from China and overseas. The work found that the R 0 estimates ranges from1.4 to 6.49 [12] [11], passing through [14] of 4.08 in mainland China. The review in [10] pointed out a mean of 3.28, a median of 2.79 and interquartile range (IQR) of 1.16, which is considerably higher than the WHO estimate at 1.95. Also in [18] the R 0 for 2019-nCov is reported in the range [1.4, 5.5] . These estimates of R 0 depend on the estimation method used as well as the validity of the underlying assumptions. In a beginning stage, due to a small amount of data and short time onset, these estimates can be biased, and in a longer period converges to the WHO estimate. The initial estimates result in a reproduction number for Covid-19 higher than SARS coronavirus, where this last it is reported to range between 2 and 5.",
