The solid stair line presents the model prediction over the entire course of the epidemic.In figure (1), the time course of the epidemic is shown 107 for the USA, Italy, Spain, and China cases. The number 108 of patients (P) over days is calculated using the optimized 109 model parameters as explained in the previous section. The 110 model was first validated against the data reported from China. 111 The model prediction agrees well with the data from the four 112 countries. The development of a number of cases as a function 113 of days relationship shows a sigomidal behavior. The steady-114 state prediction of these curves suggest that, in the US we 115 expect to have a total number of patients Pss =\u223c< 800K 116 cases. This number is lower in Italy (\u223c 180K) and Spain 117 (\u223c 20K). No surprise, the model predicted an exact number 118 for China, \u223c 85K. The higher number patients in the US case 119 of study can be explained by the steepness of the sigomidal 120 response, where the Hill coefficient was estimated to be about 121 np =\u223c 13.5 which is the highest among all countries in the 122 world so far. The model also predicted the day (Kp) that 123 marks when we expect to reach exactly half of the saturation 124 point of each country. In the US case, the results suggest a 125 saturation of the epidemic by the end of May or early June 126 2020. This forecasting date can be used to estimate the end 127 of the shutdown or lock-in-place orders. 128 Similarly, the number of deaths (D) over days is calculated 129 using the same model and is shown in figure (2) for the same 130 four countries. The model prediction agrees well with the 131 available reported death data. The number of deaths as a 132 function of days exhibits a sigomidal behavior. The steady-133 state of these curves suggest that, in the US we expect to 134 have a total number of deaths Dss =\u223c 50K. This number is 135 expected to be lower in Italy (\u223c 25K), Spain (\u223c 22K) and 136 China is about \u223c 3.5K. The higher number deaths in the 137 US are also explained by the steepness of the sigomidal death 138 response curve, i.e., nD =\u223c 17.12 which is the highest among 139 all the simulated countries. 140 In figure (3), the number of deaths per day is given for 141 the same countries.
