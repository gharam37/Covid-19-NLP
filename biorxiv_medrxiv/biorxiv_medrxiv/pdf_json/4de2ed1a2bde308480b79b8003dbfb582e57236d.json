There was a colossal 51 transmission of the virus within a matter of weeks in Wuhan, and people in the 52 resulting links of transmission spread infection by national and international travel 53 during the holidays of Chinese new year. 54 SARS-CoV-2 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics when 55 compared to SARS-CoV-1. SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in the upper 56 respiratory tract and seems to cause less abrupt onset of symptoms, comparable 57 to the conventional human coronaviruses that are a major reason of common 58 colds in the winter season. 2 Infected individuals, during the prodrome period, 59 produce a large quantity of virus in the upper respiratory tract, are mobile, and 60 carried on routine day-to-day activities, contributing to the spread of infection. 61 SARS-CoV-2 also has affinity for cells in the lower respiratory tract and can 62 replicate there also, causing radiological evidence of lesion in the lower 63 respiratory tract in patients who do not exhibit clinical pneumonia. 1 There appear 64 to be three key patterns of the clinical route of infection: mild illness with upper 65 All rights reserved.

            "text": "present, for the qualitative detection of the SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal 112 swabs, alveolar lavage fluid, sputum, and blood samples, reverse transcription-113 PCR (RT-PCR) kits are being rapidly developed. 17 Nevertheless, RT-PCR tests 114 require skilled personnel and well-equipped laboratories that restrict this 115 detection method at point-of-care centres and smaller clinics. The increasing 116 number of suspected cases surpasses the capacity of many hospitals, leaving 117 many patients untested thereby challenging the control of spread of the disease. 118 A rapid, point-of-care molecular diagnostics for the SARS-CoV-2 detection is the 119 urgent need of the hour to address the crisis. Therefore, in the present study we 120 have developed a simple closed-tube molecular diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 121 that can be carried out at point-of-care centres and small clinics by minimally 122 trained personnel without the need for sophisticated equipments. In the present 123 study, we report the development of a rapid and reliable molecular detection 124 method to identify the newly emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 by loop-125 mediated isothermal amplification assay.",

The role of faecal -oraltransmission is yet to be established in SARS-CoV-2 but was found to occur 74 A possible scenario based on the existing evidence now is that the newly 75 identified SARS-CoV-2, similar to the seasonal influenza virus, is causing mild and self-limiting disease in majority of people who are infected, with severe disease more possibly among aged people or those with comorbidities, such as diabetes, pulmonary disease, and other chronic conditions. Viruses of the family Coronaviridae have a single-strand, positive-sense RNA genome of 26 -32 kilo bases in length. 5 Coronaviruses have been reported in a number of avian hosts, 6, 7 as well as in a variety of mammals, including camels, bats, mice, dogs, and cats.
