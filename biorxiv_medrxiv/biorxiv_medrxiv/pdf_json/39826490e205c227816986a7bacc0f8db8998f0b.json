It was followed by a bigger wave mainly from local transmissions resulting in 651 cases. The following wave saw unexpectedly three digit number of daily cases following a mass gathering urged the government to choose a more stringent measure. A limited lock-down approach called Movement Control Order (MCO) was immediately initiated to the whole country as a way to suppress the epidemic trajectory. The lock-down causes a major socio-economic disruption thus the ability to forecast the infection dynamic is urgently required to assist the government on timely decisions. Limited testing capacity and limited epidemiological data complicate the understanding of the future infection dynamic of the COVID-19 epidemic.",

We used a combination of actual daily data and analysis of patterns and trends from previous cases in other countries to predict the projection of upcoming cases for Malaysia. The projection serves to support the needs for lockdown period and activity to mitigate the spread of coronavirus cases. Accurate prediction is very crucial to support right decision for upcoming lockdown period and activity. For instance, extended period for MCO can be decided based on increasing and descending trends of COVID-19 cases. This paper is organized in five sections. Section 2 reviews some prediction modelling concepts and their related works. Section 3 describes the three prediction methods (Curve Fitting Model, SIR Model and System Dynamics) used in this study and their experimental assumptions made. Finally, Section 4 presents results obtained by each of these prediction models and Section 5 concludes the paper.",

            "text": "Many models have been used to predict the outbreak pattern of COVID-19 epidemic. Several models used the normal distribution as a model of the COVID-19 epidemic and to forecast peak hospital load [13] . A curve-fitting tool to fit a nonlinear mixed effects model was developed based on available data. For instance, the cumulative rate is assumed to follow a parameterized Gaussian error function where the function is the Gaussian error function. Parameters such as death rate, the time since death rate exceeded a certain number was used as a location-specific inflection point and location-specific growth parameter, have been used. Other sigmoidal functional forms were also considered. Data was also fit to the log of the death rate in the available data, using an optimization framework. The logistic distribution is based on a continuous probability distribution which resembles the normal distribution in shape but has heavier tails. A generalized logistic growth model was used by [14] , together with the Richards growth model and a sub-epidemic wave model to generate COVID-19 10-day forecasts for Guangdong and Zhejiang. The generalized logistic growth model and the Richards model extend the simple logistic growth model with an additional scaling parameter. The sub-epidemic model accommodates complex epidemic trajectories by assembling the contribution of inferred overlapping sub-epidemics. The model was fit to the \"incidence\" curve and the best-fit solution for each model was estimated using nonlinear least squares fitting so that model parameters minimizes the sum of squared errors between the model and the data. A parametric bootstrap approach was used to generate uncertainty bounds around the best-fit solution assuming a Poisson error structure.",

            "text": "The SIR model is one of the simplest models to predict properties of how a disease spreads, for example total number of infected or the duration of an epidemic. The population is first divided into compartments, with the assumption that every individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics [15] . The model consists of three compartments: S for the number of susceptible, I for the number of infectious, and R for the number of recovered or deceased (or immune) individuals. This model is reasonably predictive for infectious diseases which are transmitted from human to human. During an epidemic, the number of susceptible individual falls rapidly as more of them are infected and thus enter the infectious and recovered compartments. Each member of the population typically progresses from susceptible to infectious to recovered. JP Morgan used a model based on SIR to estimate the COVID-19 epidemic curve in Malaysia [16] . The estimation is based on the potential size of the group that initially interacts with the infected group (i.e., group needs to get the virus test) to be around ~0.2% of the total population based on the total size of the test group in China's Hubei and South Korea, which is about 0.1 and 0.7% of the total population, respectively. The secondary infection rate (R0) was adopted based on infection parameters used in China (2) and South Korea (1.9) where a country would face a doubling of infection process in every 5-7 days in the early acceleration stage. Due to several containment measures and lower population density of Malaysia (96 people per sq. km of land area vs. Japan/ Korea: 347/ 212 according to World Bank), they set 1.7 as the initial setting of R0. Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team modified an individual-based simulation model for pandemic influenza planning by [17] to explore scenarios for COVID-19 in Great Britain. For their model, they assumed an incubation period of 5.1 days, infectiousness to occur from 12 hours prior to the onset of symptoms for those that are symptomatic and from 4.6 days after infection in those that are asymptomatic with an infectiousness profile over time that results in a 6.5-day mean generation time. They used R0=2.4 based on fits to the early growth-rate of the epidemic in Wuhan and symptomatic individuals as 50% more infectious than asymptomatic individuals. On recovery from infection, individuals are assumed to be immune to re-infection in the short term. In addition, Pueyo [18] uses the epidemic calculator provided by Goh [19] to predict the effect of control measures on spread of infection in the United States and how it will affect their healthcare services. Chen et al. proposed a time-delay dynamic system based on five compartments: external suspected people, infected people, confirmed people, isolated people, and cured people [20] . They also added external sources such as, spread rate, latent period, delay period, exposed people, and cured rate to describe the trend of COVID-19 outbreak.",

If variations occur in the data, such as dramatic shifts in test coverage, the forecast might not be accurate. To solve this problem, other methods such as machine learning can be used to analyze information from a multitude of sources and track over a hundred infectious diseases (Forbes, 2020). For instance, in December 2019, Blue Dot predicted the COVID19 outbreak using machine learning and sent out a warning to its customers to avoid Wuhan, ahead of both the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Blue Dot also predicted where other Asian city outbreaks could be by analyzing traveler itineraries and flight paths. However insufficient amount of available data when an epidemic just started is a big challenge in machine learning. In the past, three popular methods have been proposed, they include 1) augmenting the existing little data, 2) using a panel selection to pick the best forecasting model from several models, and 3) fine-tuning the parameters of an individual forecasting model for the highest possible accuracy. Fong et al. proposed a methodology based on data augmentation to the existing little data, panel selection to pick the best forecasting model from several models and fine-tuning the parameters of an individual forecasting model for the highest possible accuracy [21] . They constructed a polynomial neural network with corrective feedback model to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak with low prediction error, which is useful for predicting disease outbreak when the samples are small.",

Malaysia has made efforts to control the infection curve with school closures, bans on social gatherings, both inbound/ outbound travel restrictions and enforced the Movement Control Order effective from 18th March 2020 It is important that the government take actions to control the peak to ensure that the health facilities can cope with the need for hospitalization. The proportion of infected cases that required hospitalization and ICU admission were 20.7%-31.4% and 4.9-11.5%, respectively [16] . Malaysia's current critical care beds are estimated at 1,060.

The increase rate of total cases is around 125 cases per day. where C and d represents total cases and days respectively.

Considering a moderate initiative, enforcement, people reaction and behavioral towards Coronavirus pandemic in Malaysia, 28 days of recovery period is quite reasonable to be applied as a conservative approximation for Malaysia. This also supported by 14 days of incubation periods for respiratory recovery for coronavirus patients. The minimum control order (MCO) of 14 days is also being considered to support the assumption. Statistical method based on probability density function (PDF) is applied to fit and match the increasing rate, peak value, steady-state value, and declining rate of the active cases. For initial projection, consider the trend is similar to a symmetrical bell shape of a normal distribution pattern (also known as Gaussian distribution) to forecast the recovery curve of the active cases.

The unsymmetrical of the curves can be model using skewness effect to both sides of the distribution curve (i.e., before and after the peak value).

Therefore, 30% of the total Malaysian population are assumed to be susceptible to be infected. Using 30% population as susceptible, we produce the following model shown in Figure 16 ",

Our finding, if the susceptible population is reduced due to social distancing and MCO, the expected peak of cases could be flattened and it will peak at earlier date (around 10 days earlier than the peak of SIR model (MCO with 100% population) as shown in Figure 14) . The values of estimated parameters for these models are as shown in Table 2 . It is important to note that the parameters are very similar to the models generated based on 100% total Malaysian population.

Method 1 based on curve-fitting with probability density function estimated that the peak will be reached on 19 th April 2020 with an estimation of 5,637 infected persons. Method 2 based on SIR estimated between 630,000 to 800,000 persons will be infected at the peak of outbreak in between 20 th to 31 st May 2020 if MCO is in place. Method 3 based on Systems Dynamics estimated that 22,421 persons will be infected at the peak date around 17 th May 2020. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) was calculated using Eq. 4 and the accuracy reported in the table was calculated using Eq. 5 as reported in Section 3.4 above, based on actual data from 18 th March 2020 to 6 th April 2020. The models show different modeling have different estimation and vary in terms of difference from actual data produced by Malaysia Ministry of Health. Models to project the progress of COVID-19 in Malaysia is only as good as the data they are based upon. First, the data needs to be cleaned up so that it reflects the actual numbers. However, epidemiologists have expressed concerns that several factors are affecting the quality of the data. For instance, the number of infected persons per date must be accurate. This data is arguably not accurate when there is a backlog of 8,398 pending COVID-19 test results on April 5, 2020 in Malaysia [7] . As of April 5, a total of 51,937 people was tested, out of which 3,662 tested positive and 39,877 tested negatives. Besides a total of 3,662 confirmed coronavirus cases in Malaysia, the country also reported 61 deaths. Data such as actual dates of when COVID-19 tests are run and dates of when these test results come back is crucial to know the number of people infected on a certain date. Apart from backlog cases that were infected and tested some time ago, it is also uncertain on whether the figures reported each day have excluded data from repeated tests of patients currently under treatment.",

Based on the system dynamic model, it is likely that MCO1 has no effect in restricting the contact of an infected person because the actual total infected cases are higher than the projection with MCO.

Extensive and rapid contact tracing is needed to identify all exposed person and put under quarantine to stop them from infecting other susceptible persons. Proper surveillance method is needed to ensure compliance. If all these measures are not strengthened, MCO alone will not be sufficient even though it is executed in full force. Nevertheless, MCO is important to reduce massive contacts between peoples so that the healthcare system gained enough time to prepare. It is when all the basic control measures for COVID-19 is strongly grounded and functioning, reflected by down-turn epidemic curve, that's the moment we can safely lift up the MCO without the fear of recurring big waves of COVID-19 epidemic.",

Movement or restricted control order is crucial to mitigate the total number of people infected by COVID-19 and to ensure our health facilities can cope with the number at any given time. In this paper we generate forecasts using a Curve Fitting Model with Probability Density Function and Skewness Effect, the SIR model, and a system dynamic model to predict the trends of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia. We estimated that the peak in terms of the number of infected people will occur between middle of April 2020 to end of May 2020, with total infected numbers varying between 5,000 persons (based on existing number of infected persons) to 2.6 million (based on the total population of Malaysia regarded as people susceptible to the infection).

However, different models used different data, and they may not be accurate due to limited data but they can be used to provide more understanding of the pattern of spread. For instance, the SIR model basically give us an idea where based on the current data, how the outbreak would progress. We tried to measure for both periods before and after the implementation of the MCO. The peak result from the SIR model may not be absolutely accurate due to the limited data. However, the comparison of the modelled progression shows that implementation of the MCO where close contact has been minimized due to the social distancing can flatten the curve. If MCO 3 to be imposed, all measures must be taken to restrict the contact of an infected person as well as their contacts especially those who are under home surveillance and self-quarantine.
