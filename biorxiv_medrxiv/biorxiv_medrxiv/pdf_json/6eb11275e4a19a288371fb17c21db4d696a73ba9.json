The figures reported by BBC Persian for Iran, however, were much higher. The Covid-19 outbreak in Iran has been compounded by the ongoing decade-long US-led sanctions on Iran. A Lancet correspondence noted that \"all aspects of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment are directly and indirectly hampered, and the country (Iran) is falling short in combating the crisis. Lack of medical, pharmaceutical, and laboratory equipment such as protective gowns and necessary medication has been scaling up the burden of the epidemic and the number of casualties\" 7 . We provide the first empirical evidence on Iranian adults' level of distress and identify several predictors of their distress under the Covid-19 pandemic to enable early screening for targeting mental health services online.",

For instance, on March 27, Iranian media reported that about 300 people died due to methanol poisoning in a desperate hope that drinking alcohol kills the virus, even though the Islamic state of Iran forbids the sale of alcohol for drinking.

In the past week, 30.0%, 4.3% and 1.1% of the participants exercised on average 1, 2 and 3 hours per day respectively, 62.9% of them did not exercise in the past week, and the remaining 1.3% exercised 4 hours or more per day.

By working situations, 38.6% were working/studying from home, 26.6% were not working/studying due to the outbreak, 18.0% were not working/studying before and during the outbreak, and 16.9% still worked in an office. The participants reported their distress level in the past week using CPDI, which had a Cronbach's alpha of 0.91. The mean (SD) score of CPDI in the sample was 34.54 (14.92), higher than the CPDI of 23.65 (15.45) reported in China from January 31 to February 10, 2020 5 .
