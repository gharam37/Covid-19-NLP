We used a number of bioinformatics tools to computationally characterize ACE2 by determining its cell-specific expression, putative functions, and transcriptional regulation. The small intestine expressed higher levels of ACE2 than any other organ. The large intestine, kidney and testis showed moderate signals, whereas the signal was weak in the lung specimens. Single cell RNA-Seq data indicated positive signals along the respiratory tract in the key protective cell types including the goblet and ciliary epithelial cells, as well as in the endothelial cells and type I pneumocytes. Gene ontology analysis suggested that, besides its classical role in renin-angiotensin system, ACE2 may be functionally associated with angiogenesis/blood vessel morphogenesis. A novel tool for the prediction of transcription factor binding sites identified several putative sites for determined transcription factors within the ACE2 gene promoter. Our results also confirmed that age and gender play no significant role in the regulation of ACE2 mRNA expression in the lung.",

Therefore, it is of particular interest to correlate COVID-19 symptoms with the distribution pattern of ACE2. The first studies performed by northern blotting indicated that ACE2 is located in the human heart, kidney, and testis (2) . By immunohistochemistry, the expression of the ACE2 protein was identified in the human lung alveolar epithelial cells (type I and II pneumocytes), enterocytes of the small intestine, the brush border of the renal proximal tubules, and the endothelial cells of arteries and veins and arterial smooth muscle cells in several organs (25). It was proposed that this distribution pattern of ACE2 could explain the tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-1 for the lung, small intestine, and kidney (26). On the other hand, the symptoms of COVID-19, in contrast to SARS-CoV-1 infection, are not associated to the same extent with the gastrointestinal tract in spite of the high expression of ACE2 in the intestinal enterocytes (27). In COVID-19, diarrhea has been reported in just 3.8% of patients, in contrast to 40-70% in SARS-CoV-1 infection (21, 28) . A recent preprint report indicated diarrhea in 18.1% of 254 COVID-19 patients (29).",

They include dry cough, persistent fever, progressive dyspnea, and in some cases acute exacerbation of lung function with bilateral pneumonia (30). Major lung lesions include several pathological signs, such as diffuse alveolar damage, inflammatory exudation in the alveoli and interstitial tissue, hyperplasia of fibrous tissue, and eventually lung fibrosis (43) (44) (45) . It has been shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization technique that SARS-CoV-1 RNA locates to the alveolar pneumocytes and alveolar space (46, 47) . Considering all these facts, it is not surprising that most histopathological analyses have been focused on distal parts of the respiratory airways, while the regions other than the alveolus have been less systematically studied.

If SARS-coronaviruses predominantly attack these cells, locating along the airway segments including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles until the last segment that is the respiratory bronchioles, it would be obvious that physiological protective mechanisms are severely affected. Defective mucosal protection and inefficient removal of pathogens due to viral infection may contribute to onset of severe bilateral pneumonia that is common for SARS-diseases (51) . This pathogenic mechanism is supported by previous findings, showing that early disease is manifested as a bronchiolar disease with respiratory epithelial cell necrosis, loss of cilia, squamous cell metaplasia, and intrabronchiolar fibrin deposits When we initiated the present study, we hypothesized that understanding better the transcriptional regulation of the ACE2 gene might help to explain the peculiar distribution pattern of ACE2 in tissues. Since upregulation of ACE2 would reflect an increased number of SARS-coronavirus receptors on cell surfaces, it could possibly help us to understand the mechanisms why certain patients (males more than females, old more than young, smokers more than non-smokers) are more susceptible for the most detrimental effects of the COVID-19 infection. In our study, the signals for ACE2 mRNA in the lung specimens did not vary much in different age groups nor did they show significant differences between males and females, which is in line with the previous findings (48) .",

Later work by the same group has shown that our prediction of FOXA binding sites in the ACE2 promoter are also likely correct (54) . It is of interest that ACE2 might be regulated by oxygen status. Zhang and coworkers previously demonstrated that ACE2 mRNA and protein levels increased during the early stages of hypoxia and decreased to near-baseline levels at later stages after hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 accumulation (55) .

Prediction of transcription factor binding sites in the human ACE2 gene promoter regions of Ensembl transcripts ENST00000252519 and ENST00000427411 using TFBSfootprinter. A) Promoter region of the intestine specific ACE2 transcript. The results show putative binding sites for several transcription factors which have a strong correlation of expression with ACE2 in colon, kidney, and ileum. The predicted binding sites overlap regions of conservation in mammal species (Ensembl GERP), and cluster within 400 base pairs (bp) of the transcription start site. B) Promoter region of the lung specific ACE2 transcript. The predicted binding sites cluster within 200 bp of the TSS and overlap regions of conservation in mammal species, ATAC-Seq peaks (ENCODE), and TFBS metaclusters (GTRD).",

            "text": "To understand better the pathogenesis of COVID-19 we need to know where ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV, is located within the human respiratory tract and elsewhere. Overall, different studies including ours have convincingly shown that several organs, such as the small intestine, colon, kidney, and testis, express higher levels of ACE2 than the lung and other parts of the respiratory tract. The present results based on mouse tracheal dataset suggested that the ACE2 mRNA ispredominantly expressed in the goblet cells, ciliated epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and type 1 pneumocytes (AT1). The mouse dataset used in our study contained no secretory3 cells, which Lukassen and colleagues recently reported to express the highest levels of ACE2 mRNA along the human respiratory tract (48). Another study reported positive expression in the type II (AT2) pneumocytes (49), which is in line with the results of Lukassen et al. (48), but only a few cells appeared positive. A third study based on single cell expression data demonstrated the strongest positive signal in the lung AT2 cells, while other cells including AT1 cells, club cells, ciliated cells, and macrophages showed weaker expression (50). In spite of the obvious discrepancies between different datasets, that highlights the need for large numbers of thoroughly characterized cells for single cell RNA-Seq analyses, we can now make some conclusions of the expression of ACE2 mRNA in the respiratory tract. First, ACE2 is positively though weakly expressed in the AT2 cells of the lung and less so in the AT1 cells. Second, ACE2 also shows weak positive signal in several other cell types including the goblet cells, club cells, ciliated cells, and endothelial cells. Third, based on the findings of Lukassen et al. (48) secretory3 cells, a transient cell type of the bronchial tree, may express the highest levels of ACE2. These ACE2-positive cell types may represent the main host cells for the SARS-CoV-2 along the whole respiratory tract. The goblet cells, ciliated epithelial cells, and club cells are considered important cell types for the protection of airway mucosa. Lukassen and coworkers (48) described secretory3 cells as",

In fact, it has been suggested that early diffuse damage as a result of SARS-CoV-1 infection may actually initiate at the level of the respiratory bronchioles(52,53).Our findings confirm that the respiratory tract tissues have quite limited expression levels of ACE2 compared to several other tissues that show much more prominent signal. Because ACE2 is highly expressed in the intestine (27), as also confirmed by our bioinformatics study, it would be obvious to predict that both SARS-CoV-1 and -2 infections cause significant gastrointestinal pathology and symptoms including diarrhea. Interestingly, the patients with COVID-19 have reported less gastrointestinal symptoms than the SARS-CoV-1-infected patients(21, 28). The pathophysiological basis for this phenomenon is not understood at this point, and thus further investigations on this topic are warranted.",
