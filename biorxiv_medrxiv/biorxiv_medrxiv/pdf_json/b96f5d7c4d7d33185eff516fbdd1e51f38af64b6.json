            "text": "The ACE2 protein is highly expressed in cardiovascular and lung type II alveolar epithelial 54 cells [3, 7, 8] , where ACE2 is a primary modulator of the renin-angiotensin (RAS) system that 55 regulates blood flow, pressure and fluid homeostasis [9] . The ACE2 protein and the products 56 of the reactions it catalyses have also been implicated in immune responses and anti-57 inflammatory pathways [10] [11] [12] . 58 SARS-CoV infection reduces ACE2 gene expression and this is thought to contribute to severe 59 acute respiratory failure [4] by triggering an imbalance in the RAS system that causes a loss of 60 fluid homeostasis, induces inflammatory responses [10, 13, 14] , and results in severe acute 61 injury in heart and lung [3,15,16]. As mentioned above, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 62 utilize the ACE2 protein for cell entry. Poor prognoses in elderly SARS-CoV-2 patients (\u226565 63 years old) are frequently associated with a pre-existing reduction in ACE2 expression and 64 imbalance in ACE2-related host derived pathways [17, 18] . ACE2 is an X-linked gene whose 65 expression is regulated by chromatin structure. Brg1, a chromatin remodeler, and the FoxM1 66 transcription factor recognize the ACE2 promoter and reduce expression through a mechanism 67 NF-kB regulation and pyrimidine synthesis,  94 respectively. VSP13C, encoding a factor required for late stage endosome maturation, is also 95 controlled by a putative enhancer located in intron 11 of BMX, adjacent to ACE2. We propose 96 that ACE2 repression by SARS-CoV-2 trips a chromatin-based switch that coordinates the 97 activity of these regulatory elements and thus the genes they control. Collectively, these 98 changes inadvertently lead to the development of a pro-viral replication environment.

The VPS13 family are endoplasmic reticulum associated lipid transporters. 231 VPS13C is proposed to act as a lipid transporter at organelle contact sites between (i) the 232 endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and endolysosomes, and (ii) the ER and lipid droplets, where it 233 transfers lipids, potentially bulk lipid transfer, between organelles to maintain lipid 234 homeostasis and organelle functionality [49]. Increased VPS13C expression is predicted to 235 increase the extent of contact and lipid transfer between these organelles. This in turn virus's replication capacity and pathogenesis, as the ER plays both a physical and 237 functional central role in the virus's capacity to replicate and form new viral progeny. 238 Moreover, SARS-CoV extensively reorganizes the host cell's membranes infrastructure to 239 produce a reticulo-vesicular network of modified ER to coordinate its replication cycle [50]. 240 Alterations to ER-lipid droplet contacts mediated by VPS13C could support the virus's 241 required expansion and re-organization of ER membranes by altering lipid flow through the 242 ER [51]. Notably, cells infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a positive-strand RNA virus 243 like SARS-CoV-2, contain ER-derived membraneous structures that contain significantly high 244 levels of cholesterol, despite the ER of uninfected cells possessing relatively low cholesterol 245 levels [52]. Increased VPS13C-mediated ER-endolysosomal contact sites could increase the 246 capacity of endocytosed dietary cholesterol to be delivered to the ER and enhance the virus's 247 ability to replicate. Pharmacological impairment of endolysosomal cholesterol efflux reduced 248 HCV replication, [52] suggesting another possible therapeutic approach for investigation to 249 slow SARS-CoV-2 replication. ER stress, impacted by changes to VSP13C expression, may 250 also contribute to late infection stage NF-\u03baB activation (reviewed in [53]). 251 The significance of the putative enhancer for PHKA2, which encodes the phosphorylase kinase 252 regulatory subunit alpha 2, is unclear. Mutations in this gene have been linked to glycogen 253 storage disorders and glucose metabolism. Thus, linkages can be drawn to the increased 254 expression of CA5B, which impacts on gluconeogenesis. Notably, PHKA2 was downregulated 255 in plasma from individuals with hepatocellular-carcinoma caused by HCV infections [54]. 256 Theoretically, chromatin remodeling in response to SARS-COV-2 infection could down-257 regulate PHKA2 expression. However, there is a paucity of information linking this gene to 258 viral infections or the lung and this conclusion requires additional experimental support.",

Ideally, the Hi-C datasets should be derived from matched 276 tissues prior and post SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This control is complex, as illustrated by the 68 finding that ACE2 gene escapes X chromosome-inactivation and shows a heterogeneous sex 69 bias that is tissue dependent[20]. 70Chromatin structure in the nucleus involves non-random folding of DNA on different scales 71[21]. This folding and the resulting contacts that form are dynamic, and can be disrupted (e.g.72 by genetic variation) leading to altered enhancer-promoter interactions that result in changes 73 in gene expression [22]. Changing chromatin structure rewires interactions between regulatory 74 elements and the genes they control. Theoretically and practically, each component of this 75 change contributes to the observed pathogenesis [23,24], and can lead to developmental 76 Virus-induced chromatin changes at the ACE2 locus could induce expression changes in 78 additional genes regulated by elements located within this locus and thus may alter/modulate 79 host factors important for SARS-CoV-2 replication. How can you identify the elements within 80 a gene regulatory network like this? One approach to identify the networks that form between 81 regulatory elements and the genes they control is to use information on the physical interactions 82 that are captured occurring between the elements. Physical interactions between two sites can 83 be captured and identified using Hi-C [29,30]. We have used this insight to develop a 84 discovery-based pipeline (CoDeS3D; S1 Fig) [23]. Our approach uses genetic variation (e.g. 85 single nucleotide polymorphisms) to identify changes in gene expression and thus determine if 86 a region that physically contacts a gene contains a regulatory element. This enables the rapid 87 identification of the regulatory networks that form in cells and tissues (e.g. [23,31]). 88We hypothesized that ACE2 and its flanking region contained regulatory elements that 89 coordinate the expression of other genes, and that virus induced chromatin changes at ACE2 90 inadvertently modulate host factors that promote viral replication. Here we undertook an in-91 depth characterization of the regulatory control regions within ACE2 and their activity in lung 92 tissue.
