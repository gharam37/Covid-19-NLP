Furthermore, since the airway 80 epithelium acts as a sentinel for the entire respiratory system, its cellular composition, 81 along with its transcriptional and functional characteristics, are significantly shaped by 82 interaction with environmental stimuli. These stimuli may be inhaled (e.g., cigarette 83 smoke, allergens, microorganisms) or endogenous, such as when signaling molecules 84 are produced by airway immune cells present during different disease states. One such 85 disease state is allergic airway inflammation caused by type 2 (T2) cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, 86 IL-13), which is common in both children and adults and has been associated with the 87 development of both asthma and COPD in a subgroup of patients 11-13 . T2 cytokines are 88 known to greatly modify gene expression in the airway epithelium, both through 89 transcriptional changes within cells and epithelial remodeling in the form of mucus 90 metaplasia 11, 14, 15 . Microbial infection is another strong regulator of airway epithelial 91 expression. In particular, respiratory viruses can modulate the expression of thousands 92 of genes within epithelial cells, while also recruiting and activating an assortment of 93 immune cells [16][17][18] . Even asymptomatic nasal carriage of respiratory viruses, which is 94 especially common in childhood, has been shown to be associated with both genome-95 wide transcriptional re-programming and infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils in 96 the airway epithelium 19 , demonstrating how viral infection can drive pathology even 97 without overt signs of illness.",

The TMPRSS2 gene was contained within one 174 of a set of three highly correlated networks exhibiting strong enrichments for mucus 175 Supplementary Table 4 ).

To identify subjects with high and low T2 194 inflammation, we hierarchically clustered all subjects based on the expression of genes 195 in the canonical T2 network (saddle brown). This resulted in the identification of two 196 distinct groups we labeled as T2-high (n=364) and T2-low (n=331) (Supplementary 197 Figure 1a ).

We found that ACE2 expression was 1.7-fold higher in the 243 interferon-high vs. interferon-low group (Figure 4d ). In a previous study, we found that 244 children with nasal gene expression characteristic of the interferon network tended to be 245 infected with a respiratory virus, despite being asymptomatic 19 .

In line with this possibility we 424 observe more moderate levels of ACE2 expression in our bulk RNA-seq data on nasal 425 brushings. 426 427 Airway inflammation caused by type 2 cytokine production from infiltrating immune cells 428 plays a prominent role in the control of cellular composition, expression, and thus 429 biology of the airway epithelium 11, 13, 23, 27 . Moreover, while T2 airway inflammation is an 430 important driver of T2-high asthma and COPD disease endotypes, it is also associated 431 with atopy in the absence of lung disease, a very common phenotype in both children 432 and adults. In fact, among the children in this study, we find that 43% of non-asthmatics 433 were scored as T2-high based on expression profile, further substantiating the high 434 prevalence of T2 airway inflammation outside of those with lung disease. Our data 435 suggest that airway epithelial TMPRSS2 expression is highly upregulated by T2 436 inflammation, and specifically by IL-13. Both our network and single cell data show that 437 TMPRSS2 is most prominent in less developed \"early secretory\" cells as well as in more 438 mature mucus secretory cells. Based on our in vitro data, IL-13 upregulates TMPRSS2 439 across nearly all types of epithelial cells, but the core of this effect appears to be in the 440 induced metaplasia. In contrast to enhanced levels of TMPRSS2, T2 inflammation, 446 whether observed in vivo or induced with IL-13 stimulation, precipitated a dramatic 447 reduction in levels of epithelial ACE2, thus complicating expectations for how T2 448 inflammation might affect overall risk for a poor COVID-19 outcome. Germane to this 449 question, a recent study of 85 fatal COVID-19 subjects found that 81.2% of them 450 exhibited very low levels of blood eosinophil levels 4 . Blood eosinophil levels are a 451 strong, well-known predictor of airway T2 inflammation and were strongly correlated 452 with T2 status in our study as well 11, 23 . Together, these studies provisionally suggest 453 that T2 inflammation may predispose individuals to experience better COVID-19 454 outcomes through a decrease in airway levels of ACE2 that override any countervailing 455 effect from increased expression of TMPRSS2. However, both in vitro experiments 456 examining IL-13 effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection and empirical data on COVID-19 457 outcomes among T2-high and T2-low patients will certainly be needed to determine 458 whether this common airway inflammatory endotype ultimately protects against or 459 exacerbates COVID-19 illness. As mentioned above, we note that measurement of 460 blood eosinophil levels could be used as an informative and more accessible (albeit less 461 powerful) proxy for investigating the association between airway T2 inflammation and 462 outcomes of COVID-19. Moreover, given the higher frequency of T2 inflammation 463 among asthmatic subjects, this population should be monitored especially closely given The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.034454 doi: bioRxiv preprint In addition to a strong negative influence of T2 inflammation on ACE2 expression in the 468 airway, we found an equally strong positive influence of respiratory virus infections on 469 levels of this gene.

After filtering, 12,590,800 genetic variants were carried forward into the eQTL 690 analysis. For expression data filtering and preparation, we first ran Kallisto 43 (v0.43.0) to 691 generate transcript per million (TPM) values. We filtered out any genes that did not 692 reach both TPM > 0.1 and raw counts > 6 for at least 20% of our samples. After filtering, 693 17,039 genes were then TMM normalized using edgeR44  (v3.22.3). Finally, we applied 694 an inverse normal transformation into the TMM-normalized expression values to render 695 them suitable for eQTL analysis. To account for global population structure, we ran 696 the genotype data to create five admixture factors. We then 697 ran Probabilistic Estimation of Expression Residuals 46 (PEER, v1.3) to create 60 PEER 698 factors to utilize as covariates in the eQTL analysis along with admixture estimates, 699 gender, age, body-mass index (BMI), and asthma diagnosis status. To perform cis-700 eQTL analysis, we utilized a modified version of FastQTL 47 that was provided by the 701 GTEx project. Furthermore, we performed stepwise regression analysis to identify 702 independent eQTL variants using QTLTools 48 (v1.1). Allelic Fold Change (A FC ) of the 703 eQTL variant is computed using the aFC python script 49 . 704 705Virus identification and quantification from bulk RNA-Seq data 706To identify individuals with asymptomatic virus infection at the time of sample collection, 707 viral genomic sequences were recovered from bulk RNA-seq data using a modified 708 version of the Virus Finder 2.0 (VF2) pipeline 50 . A custom respiratory virus reference 709 database comprising >600k sequences was employed to improve specificity. Using 710 VF2, viral reads were garnered by removing human reads using Bowtie2 51 (default 711 settings) and selecting viral reads using BLAT 52 (minIdentity=80); contigs were 712 assembled using Trinity 53 ; short (<200 bp) or low complexity (DUST score < 0.07) 713 contigs and contigs matching the human genome at a BLAST 54 e-value <0.05 were 714 discarded; the remaining contigs were classified using BLAST (e-value <0.05); read 715 counts were obtained by read mapping using BLAT (minIdentity=98). Of the 468 distinct 716 viral reference sequences detected by VF2, 7 were identified as erroneous and 717 removed. The remaining 461 matches were manually assigned viral serotypes and the 718 results aggregated with R.",
