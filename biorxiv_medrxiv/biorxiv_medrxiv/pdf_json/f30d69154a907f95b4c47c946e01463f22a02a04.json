Several countries, specially those first hit by the disease, have adopted a standard progressive protocol, from containment to mitigation to supression [1] . As these strategies failed to deter the spread of the virus, government authorities introduced ever more stringent measures on their citizens' movements in an attempt to suppress or sharply reduce the propagation of the virus. More recently, countries have adopted drastic countermeasures at the very outset of the outbreak. For example, on March 24, 2020, India announced a threeweek total ban on people \"venturing out\" of their homes [2] , even though there were fewer than 500 confirmed cases and only nine people had died from COVID-19 in a country with a population of 1.3 billion people. One difficulty in deciding the best approach to counter the spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is that the virus propagation dynamics is not yet well understood.",

Such estimates are, of course, prone to high uncertainty: the less data available and the further in the future, the greater the uncertainty. Notwithstanding their inherent shortcomings, simple mathematical models provide valuable tools for quickly assessing the severity of an epidemics and help to guide the health and political authorities in defining or adjusting their national strategies to fight the disease [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] .",

As a general rule, the sooner an intervention is put in place the more effective it is expected to be. It is however difficult to model a priori how effective any given set of interventions will be. The effectiveness of interventions are often investigated through complex agent-based simulation models [11, 12] , which require a synthetic population and a host of parameters related to the human-to-human transmission, and as such they are very costly computationally [13] and heavily dependent on the choices of values for the various model parameters.",

We show that the RGM describes reasonably well the fatality curves of all selected countries analysed in this study. We also introduce a theoretical framework, within the context of the RGM model, to calculate the efficiency of interventions. Here an intervention strategy is modelled by assuming that its net result is to alter the parameters of the RGM after a given time t 0 , so that the full epidemics dynamics is then described in terms of two RGM models: one before and the other after the time t 0 , where certain 'matching conditions' are imposed at t 0 . In this way, we are able to derive an analytical formula for the efficiency of the corresponding intervention as a function of the adoption time t 0 . We show, in particular, that the intervention efficiency quickly decays past a critical adoption time, thus showing that time is really of essence in containing an outbreak.",

As many carriers of the virus are either asymptomatic or develop only mild symptoms, they will will not be detected unless they are tested. In other words, the number of confirmed cases for COVID-19 is a poor proxy for the total number of infections. Furthermore, the fraction of confirmed cases relative to the total number of infections depends heavily on the testing policy of each country, which makes it problematic to compare the evolution of confirmed cases among different countries. In contrast, the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 is a much more reliable measure of the advance of the epidemics and its severity. Of course, many other factors, such as age structure of a population and quality of care, may affect the fraction of deaths relative to the number of confirmed cases. Nevertheless, it is expected that overall the evolution of number of deaths bear a relation to the dynamics of the number of infections [19] . Under these circumstances and in the absence of reliable estimates for the number of infected cases for COVID-19, we decided here to seek an alternative approach and model directly the mortality curves, defined as the cumulative number of deaths as a function of time, rather than the number of confirmed cases, as is more usually done.",

In other words, the trend (i.e., the derivative) one sees at a given time t reflects in part the measures taken at some earlier time (or lack thereof). Thus, imposing continuity of the derivative of the epidemic curve at time t 0 in our 'intervention strategy' seeks to capture this delay effect. In our intervention model above, we assume that the net result of the action is to alter the parameters r and \u03b1 of the Richards model at time t 0 . Of course, the difficult part is to estimate how a particular set of intervention measures (e.g., contact tracing and quarantine of contacts, social distancing, school closures, etc) would influence these parameters. Such an analysis is however beyond the scope of the present paper. Note furthermore that, as discussed above, the time t 0 is not the actual time of adoption of the intervention but rather the time at which the corresponding measures have started to affect the epidemics dynamics, as reflected in the number of cases. Nevertheless we shall for simplicity refer to t 0 as the intervention 'adoption time.' As defined in (6), an intervention strategy adopted at time t 0 can be viewed as a map (r, K, \u03b1, t c ) \u2192 (r , K , \u03b1 , t c ) in the parameter space of the RGM, which results in the condition K /K < 1. Let us therefore define the intervention efficiency as the relative reduction in the total number of cases: \u03b7(t 0 ) = (K \u2212 K )/K, where it is assumed that \u03b7(t 0 ) > 0.

This indicates that the evolution of the number of deaths in the COVID-19 epidemic can be effectively described with a dynamical model such as the Richards model. In Fig. 1(b) we show the cumulative deaths for Italy together with the respective RGM fit. Here again the RGM seems to be able to provide a reasonably good fit to the data.

Here, however, care must be taken when estimating the model parameters from small time series, since it is well known that the Richards model [20, 21] and its variants [13] are susceptible to the problem of over fitting, owing to the redundancy of the parameters. This may lead, for example, to estimation of certain parameters that are outside of biologically or otherwise reasonable ranges [20] . For example, when applied to the number of infected cases in an epidemics the parameter \u03b1 should be constrained within the interval (0, 1). Here we apply the RGM instead to the number of deaths, but we assume that the same constraint should be observed. In other words, fits that return \u03b1 outside this interval are disregarded as not reliable. The unsuitability of the RGM is particularly serious when the available data does not encompass the inflection point t c [13] . As more data is accumulated, the model is expected to become more accurate. However, if strong measures are implemented towards mitigation or suppression, the dynamics of the epidemics is likely to change, so that different parameter models are required before and after the adoption of the countermeasures; see next section.",

Recall that the parameter r in the RGM corresponds to the growth rate at the early stage of the epidemics; hence an early intervention should, in our language, seek to reduce this parameter, i.e., r < r. We shall therefore refer to this type of intervention as 'mitigation'. Similarly, at later stages of the epidemics one should try to increase the parameter \u03b1, i.e., we want to have \u03b1 > \u03b1, so as to force the levelling off of the curve of cumulative cases as soon as possible after the intervention; this type of strategy will thus be said to be of the 'suppression' type. More specifically, in our model we can define two general sets of intervention strategies: i) mitigation, when we take \u03b1 = \u03b1 and r < r; and ii) suppression, meaning r = r and \u03b1 > \u03b1. (More generally, a mixed strategy would modify both r and \u03b1, but for our purposes here it is preferable to study separately the effects of these two parameters.)",

More specifically, in our intervention strategies we take r = 0.44 and \u03b1 = 0.21 for t < t 0 , as obtained from the fit showed in Fig. 1(b) , whereas for t > t 0 we suppose two possible scenarios: mitigation and suppression. In the first type of scenario, shown in Fig. 3(a) , we set \u03b1 = \u03b1 and consider two mitigation strategies: i) action 1 with r = 0.5 (blue) and ii) action 2 with r = 0.6 (red). In the second scenario shown in Fig. 3 (a), we consider instead r = r and implement two suppression strategies: i) action 1 with \u03b1 = 0.3 (red) and ii) action 2 with \u03b1 = 0.9 (blue). Of course, only intervention strategies with t 0 > T , where T denotes the 'present time' (i.e., the time of the last data point) would be of practical value in an ongoing epidemics. (For the Italian data, T = 40.) Nevertheless, for t 0 < T the efficiency curve is still of some interest, as it indicates the relative reduction in fatalities that would have resulted had the corresponding strategy been adopted at some earlier time t 0 in the past. In all cases shown in Fig. 3 , we see that there is a quick decrease in efficiency as the adoption time increases. This confirms the commonly held view that there is only a narrow window of opportunity, after the outbreak of an epidemic, during which effective countermeasures can be taken that could have a significant impact in the final outcome.",

Our modelling of the fatality curves is particularly relevant for the COVID-19 outbreak, because the actual number of infections remains largely unknown, so one is required to turn to proxy measures, such as mortality data, to gain a better understanding of the epidemics. The paper also shows how simple and soluble mathematical models can provide a rich theoretical framework in which to investigate some basic and deep aspects of epidemics dynamics. In particular, we have successfully applied the Richards growth model to describe the fatalities curves for four different countries, at different stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, namely China, Italy, Spain, Iran, and Germany. We also analysed the case of Brazil, which is in a much earlier stage of the outbreak, so here we resorted to a modified exponential growth model, also known as the generalized growth model. This model gave a good fit of the rising fatality curve of Brazil, from which we could estimate that as of this writing the time for doubling the number of fatalities from COVID-19 in Brazil is about 4 days.",
