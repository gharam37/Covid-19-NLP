Yet it remains unclear whether seasonal and geographic variations in climate can substantially alter the pandemic trajectory, given high susceptibility is a core driver. Here, we use a climate-dependent epidemic model to simulate the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic probing different scenarios of climate-dependence based on known coronavirus biology. We find that while variations in humidity may be important for endemic infections, during the pandemic stage of an emerging pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2 climate may drive only modest changes to pandemic size and duration. Our results suggest that, in the absence of effective control measures, significant cases in the coming months are likely to occur in more humid (warmer) climates, irrespective of the climate-dependence of transmission and that summer temperatures will not substantially limit pandemic growth.",

Sustained local transmission is present in multiple countries, in all continents, and the implications in terms of morbidity and mortality are expected to be severe [1, 2] . The role of seasonal and geographic climate variations in modulating the transmission of the virus has received increasing attention. Studies using a regression framework have found a role for temperature, relative humidity and specific humidity in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] , suggesting that cold, dry conditions increase the transmission of the virus. However, with limited data on the current epidemic, these early-stage results are inevitably inconclusive. Furthermore, the relative importance of climate drivers when compared to high population susceptibility during the pandemic stage of an emerging infection such as SARS-CoV-2, has not been fully characterized.",

Emerging pathogens, in contrast, have distinct dynamics driven by high population susceptibility. A key question is the extent to which seasonal and geographic climate variations are relevant in the pandemic phase of an emerging infection. Here we build on known features of coronaviruses and other directly-transmitted infections to probe this question. Although we do not yet know the climate sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 transmission directly, data exists on four other coronaviruses that currently circulate in human populations. Two of these coronaviruses, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, are of the same betacoronavirus genus as SARS-CoV-2 [17] .",

All other parameters are fixed, based on values from Kissler et al 2020 [17] .

Fig.1 shows average monthly specific humidity and normalized cases (between 0 and 1) for OC43 and HKU1 in the US. Cases of both diseases increase as specific humidity declines. For comparison, we show the relationship between specific humidity and SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China during the first 9 weeks of 2020. In contrast to the endemic coronaviruses, cases of COVID-19 shown an increase with humidity. As explored below, this does not mean that high humidity increases transmission, but that pandemics driven by novel pathogens may exhibit distinct patterns compared to endemic diseases [21] . We assume that to some extent transmission will decline with specific humidity, however, the extent of the decline is yet to be determined. We characterize the link between specific humidity and the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 using plausible estimates derived from the two endemic betacoronaviruses as well as influenza. Fig.2 shows different potential functional forms for the climatetransmission relationship. Changes to specific humidity modulate R 0 between a maximum wintertime value 3 .

Although our HKU1 scenarios presents a modest role for climate in terms of shifting the timing and intensity of the pandemic, a scenario with OC43 parameters is equally likely. In terms of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, our results imply that both tropical and temperate locations should prepare for severe outbreaks of the disease and that summertime temperatures will not effectively limit the spread the infection. However, this does not mean the climate is not important in the longer term. Endemic cycles of the disease will likely be tied to climate factors and seasonal peaks may vary with latitude (Fig.S3) . A more detailed understanding of climate drivers as well as immunity length will be crucial for understanding secondary outbreaks. Furthermore, weather and near-term climate forecasts could be helpful for predicting such outbreaks after the initial pandemic phase has passed. 7 .

The immunity length of SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be determined, however, some early stage research found that rhesus macaques could not be reinfected 30 days post-infection [23] . Studies using another endemic coronavirus, NL63, found that neutralizing antibody titers declined to zero 52 weeks after first infection [24] . Using the US betacoronavirus data, another modelling effort found an immunity length of 40 weeks [17] . Here, we assume 20 weeks in the lower bound on immunity length, and allow the model to fit a maximum immunity length of two years. Our fitted immunity lengths, L, are 62.5 and 66.25 weeks for OC43 and HKU1 respectively. Our fitted values for a are -32.5 and -227.5 for OC43 and HKU1 respectively. Visualization of the fitting process is shown in Fig. S1 and S2.",

For the northern hemisphere locations, we do not see any substantial difference in pandemic size across all three scenarios, despite very different climates in New York, London and Delhi. In the influenza and HKU1 scenarios, tropical locations experience a more sustained, lower intensity pandemic than the northern hemisphere. These scenarios represent a stronger dependence on climate than OC43, such that the lack of really dry conditions (low specific humidity) in tropical regions means these locations do not experience the high transmission rates of New York, London and Delhi. However, the outbreak in the tropical cities remains significant, and factors we do not explore here, such as population density, could further exacerbate the size of the epidemic.",
