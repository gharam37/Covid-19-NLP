Explicit analytical formulas as well as numerical results are presented to rapidly elucidate what-if questions on averting resurgence of the coronavirus epidemic after the first wave wanes. Implementation of related ideas would rely on a mix of several factors, including personal initiative and sophisticated technology for monitoring and testing. For robust decision making on the subject, detailed multidisciplinary studies remain indispensable.",

            "text": "In the absence of a vaccine, restrictions on social distancing have been used widely in recent efforts to avert an inordinately large number of fatalities from potentially uncontrolled spread of COVID-19. [1] [2] [3] Underlying these efforts are fundamental constraints emerging from the dynamics of infectious disease spreading, as captured in the most elementary form by the standard SIR model: [4] [5] [6] [7] The coronavirus basic reproductive ratio, 0 , naturally between 2 and 3 ( Figure 1 ) 8 should be brought close to 1 (or below) by social distancing measures, 8, 9 with correspondingly flattened curves of percent-infectious over time. [10] [11] [12] With the end of the first wave of the epidemic projected in a few weeks, questions arise about removal of social distancing measures. As desirable as the \"return to normal\" is, fundamental constraints remain that prevent complete removal of restriction measures until a vaccine is available for safe use. 13 Indeed, the total fraction of infected -therefore eventually immune -by the end of the first wave will be at single percentage points, 2 far below the 1 \u2212 1/ 0 \u2248 60% required to robustly avert resurgence of the epidemic. 7 Therefore, a number of strategies are considered, such as alternating imposition and removal of measures over time, 1 stratification by age, pre-existing conditions, location, or other risk-factors, 1,14 mass screening, contact tracing, testing of all individuals entering the country, and quarantine of people who test positive. 15 The purpose of this paper is to analyze the dynamics of simply placing restrictions on people infected by the virus after they have shown symptoms of the disease.

A distinction between the SPIR model structure and other fourcompartment structures, such as the classic SEIR, [4] [5] [6] [7] 18 is that individuals with coronavirus infection entering the P group can infect before symptoms appear. Therefore, it is practically formidable to monitor those infecting during the presymptomatic period, as this would require inordinately massive testing or widespread tracking of contacts to guide selective testing. On the other hand, monitoring individuals with symptoms is more reasonable, as symptoms are fairly characteristic of the infection and testing for confirmation of the infection can be highly targeted. 19 This type of interaction between the S, I, and P compartments is captured in the model structure shown in Figure 2 . This structure indicates dynamics by separately adjustable feedback from the P group, in addition to feedback from the I group typically considered. Consequently, the following equations capture the dynamics of a fixed-size population with measures restricting transmission of the virus between susceptible and symptomatic infectious individuals:",

To the extent that measures can be taken to effectively implement such restrictions, they could help effective containment of the epidemic, particularly if combined with ideas tailoring measures to account for risk stratification. As already pointed out, successful implementation would hinge on a mix of several factors, including personal initiative and sophisticated technology for monitoring and testing. The simple formulas and graphs presented here, based on widely available background, will hopefully help provide guidelines for rapidly addressing what-if questions in a transparent way. For robust decision making detailed multidisciplinary studies remain indispensable. 24 ",
