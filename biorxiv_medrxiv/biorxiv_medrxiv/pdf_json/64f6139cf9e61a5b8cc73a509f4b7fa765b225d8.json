The program is built in Simulink with a block diagram display. The mathematical model used in this program is the SIR and SEIRD models represented by a set of differential-algebraic equations. It can be easily modified to develop new models for the problem. The program uses the outbreaks of China and Italy as test models. The infection and recovery rate functions are treated as constant, variable, or a combination of the two. In addition, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is employed and proposed to train the model and predict its output. The program showed good matching between the simulated and the reported cases and it predicts the final size of the Italy outbreak to be in the range 230,000-330,000 cases as of July 2020.",

In the literature, several analytical approaches have been proposed to model the pandemic including Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model [6] [7] , Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model [1], Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model [8, 9] , and fractional-derivative SEIR [10] , and SEIRD [11] .

            "text": "It is advantageous to have an educational program that displays the mathematical model of the epidemic in a visualized block diagram instead of a coded script. One of the widely-used platforms for studying the dynamic behavior of a system is Simulink. It has been used by many academic researchers in different fields for simulating a system using time-domain simulations. A dynamic system, such as the COVID-19 epidemic, can be mathematically modeled by a set of differential equations (DEs) or a set of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) depending on the employed model. Simulink provides the user with useful mathematical tools including parameter estimation and system optimization which are needed in simulating a pandemic such as COVID-19. Simulink allows the user to enter and plot the confirmed cases of infection of the disease as an input to the system and then compute the system parameters (for instance, infection rate, recovery rate, etc.) so that the output of the simulation and the collected actual data are equals or very close to each other. This paper presents an open-source program for tracking, estimating, and simulating the coronavirus outbreak. Unlike the existing models, the mathematical model of the outbreak is represented and visualized as a block diagram in Simulink using SIR and SEIRD representation. The infection and recovery rate functions are treated as a constant, variable, or a combination of them. With the application of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), the outbreak of China and Italy are implemented in Simulink using both a standard mathematical model and ANFIS system. 1.1 SIR, SEIR, and SIRD models SIR model is a basic representation used widely to describe a disease spread, and it is the fundamental model for the other models such as SEIR and SIRD. SIR model consists of threecompartment levels: Susceptible, Infectious, and Removed. Any individual belongs to one of these groups. A brief description of these compartments is given below. Susceptible individuals are those people who have no immunity to the disease but they are not infectious. Since there is no vaccine yet developed for this disease, we can say that the entire community is exposed to get infected by this disease and hence, the \"Susceptible\" compartment can be represented by the entire population. An individual in the \"Susceptible\" level can move into the next level of the model (Infectious) through contact SimCOVID: An Open-Source Simulation Program for the COVID-19 Outbreak C 1 with an infectious person. By this single transmission, the number of susceptible\\infectious people reduces\\increases by one, respectively. The next group of people is for the infectious people who have the disease and can spread it to susceptible people. Infectious people can move to the \"Removed\" compartment by recovering from the disease. The removed compartment includes those who are no longer infectious and the ones who have dies from the disease (closed cases). The summation of these three compartments in the SIR model remains constant and equals the initial number of population. A basic SIR model is shown in Fig. 1 , where denotes the infection rate or the transmission rate or the force of infection, and denotes the recovery or removed rate. Generally speaking, these parameters ( , ) are not constant; they are functions of the size of infectious and recovery compartments. These are the parameters that we want to optimize and estimate so that the reported and simulated cases are approximately equals. To solve this set of differential equations, we need initial values for the three-state variables , , and namely (0) , (0) , and (0) . The initial value (0) is the community population impacted by the outbreak [6] , whereas, (0) is the number of confirmed cases that can be any value but not zero. We can set (0) to zero if the start times of the spread and simulation are equals. The transmission rate reduces monotonically with time [6] .",

The objective is to cover and better fit the concave-up and -down portions of the curve. In this study and for more reliable results, the cumulative reported cases graph is split into three periods at two critical points: (1) period-1 from time zero until 1, where stands for starting time, (2) period-2 from 1 to 2 and (3) period-3 from 2 until the rest of simulation time. The critical time points ( 1 and 2) were chosen empirically based on some observation notes about the given curve. It is also possible to let these values variables to be found by the program. The total period of time was chosen to be from the day when the first case of the disease was reported until the curve starts to flatten. Three step-blocks were used for the parameters ( , ). These quantities are unknown variables; we want to determine their values and the overall shape forms so that the output of our simulation and the collected data are equals. The parameter estimation tool in Simulink was employed to optimize the system and predict the infection and recovery rates. A reasonable set of initial values were selected for the parameters (positive values between 0-2 for the recovery gains and negative similar values for the exponential powers used for the infection function). Figure 3 shows a part of this simulation with the number of iterations, values of the parameters at each iteration, and the comparison between the collected and simulated data. We can observe a quite matching between the two curves after 100 iterations. It should be noted that the selection of initial values given to the optimization algorithm plays a significant role in the speed to reach the desired accuracy. Therefore, it is recommended to set reasonable values for these quantities to accelerate the simulation. An important indicator of a pandemic is the ratio between the infection and recovery rates, or namely, the reproduction ratio. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

We can see a reproductive ratio of more than one (a sign of pandemic) from the beginning of the outbreak until around the inflection point of the curve. The numerical results obtained from this simulation are plotted and shown in Fig. 5a for the China outbreak and Fig.5b -c for the Italy outbreak. The daily infectious state variable is plotted on the left y-axis whereas the cumulative infectious variable is plotted on the right y-axis. Note that the cumulative infectious is the sum of the daily infectious values which can be modeled in Simulink using an integrator. As mentioned in [6] , the sudden jump in the curve is due to the way the data was collected and the diagnosis techniques which is not interpreted by a natural variation of a pandemic. Therefore, the program tries to change the parameters so that the simulated cumulative cases are close to the actual recorded ones. There is a good matching between the two cumulative plots although the daily infectious plots show some mismatch at peak time. For the Italy outbreak, there is a quite matching between the simulated and the reported cases as there is no change in the calculation method. In addition, we need to estimate the final size of the epidemic. The program estimates the rest of the simulation and the results show that the total cases for Italy outbreak could reach 230,000-330,000 cases at the end of July 2020 with a \u00b110 error in the infection rate. This estimation is based on the given data from the beginning of the reported cases until the date April 09, 2020. For the China outbreak, it is enough to take data for simulation until the settling time of the curve which is around middle of March 2020. Fig. 5b -c show the daily infectious and cumulative infectious plots for the Italy outbreak with the estimated final range colored in grey [17] .",

Nonlinear least Square technique comes with either Levenberg-Marquardt or Trust-Region_reflective strategy. Pattern Search strategy involves Positive Basis NP1 and 2N, Genetic Algorithm, Latin Hypercube, and Nelder Mead techniques. Furthermore, the cost function can be selected as either Sum Squared or Absolute Error.

Using the same initial values used for the SIR model, the model gives similar results comparing to the standard model but with two new variables, the exposed and mortality cases.

In the Simulink model, we can represent all these control measures by a step function and simulate the system under these conditions. These controls affect the infection rate giving a decline in the beta function. On the other hand, developing a vaccine or involving any other ways to recover or slow down the disease (such as providing the hospitals with all the necessary ventilators) affect the recovery-rate parameter by increasing this value. As a result, the reproduction ratio reduces by any change in these two parameters. It is also easy in Simulink to see the impact of a delay in response on the curve. This can be achieved by adding a delay block to the infection function. However, more details about the model are needed for this problem.",

We can also build a machine-learning program to simulate the same system using the input and output data of the model. Simulink provides the user with an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) toolbox to generate if-then fuzzy rules automatically based on training the given data. References [18] present a detailed description of this technique in which the same methodology is employed in this paper. Using a basic SIR model built in Simulink with a variable infection rate and constant recovery rate, the model is trained using input-out data. The input could be the infection rate, recovery rate, or a combination of the two. The output could be the infectious output or its cumulative function. In this study, the beta function and its derivative are used as input variables to the ANFIS model whereas the infectious and cumulative infectious variables are chosen for the output in two different training processes. ANFIS allows us to use only one output for each block and for this reason, two separate processes are used to generate two ANFIS blocks for the two outputs. More outputs require more ANFIS blocks. Figure 7 shows a simple Simulink program used in this training. The recovery function is treated as constant as proposed in [6] whereas the infection rate is treated as variable [6] . With the parameters optimized, the ANFIS toolbox is used to generate seven fuzzy rules for each output. The membership function used in this training is the gaussian function. Figure  8a -c shows the training iterations, fuzzy rules, and the ANFIS outputs for the cumulative and infectious variables. Figure 9 shows the Simulink model for the ANFIS blocks used in this simulation. These if-then rules are used to simulate the case of China outbreak and the results are shown in Fig. 10a . whereas Fig. 10b shows the infections and recovery parameter values. Notably, the results show some good matching but it needs improvement. A more detailed and complicated beta function formula can be used to improve the accuracy of the results.",
