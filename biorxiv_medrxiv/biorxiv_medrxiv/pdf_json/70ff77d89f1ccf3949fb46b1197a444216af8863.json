There is no vaccine or antiviral available for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we report our discovery of inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ). Using the FRET-based enzymatic assay, several inhibitors including boceprevir, GC-376, calpain inhibitors II, XII, and MG-132 were identified to have potent activity with single-digit to submicromolar IC50 values in the enzymatic assay. The mechanism of action of the hits was further characterized using enzyme kinetic studies and thermal shift binding assays. Significantly, four compounds (boceprevir, GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII) inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in cell culture with EC50 values ranging from 0.49 to 3.37 \u00b5M. Notably, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII represent novel chemotypes that are distinct from known M pro inhibitors. Overall, the compounds identified herein provide promising starting points for the further development of SARS-CoV-2",

The mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is around 6.4% as of April 15, 2020, which is lower than that of SARS (~10%) and MERS (~34%). 2 However, current data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious and has a larger R0 value than SARS and MERS, 6 resulting in higher overall death tolls than SARS and MERS.

The SARS-CoV-2 viral genome encodes a number of structural proteins (e.g. capsid spike glycoprotein), non-structural proteins (e.g. 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL or main protease), papain-like protease, helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), and accessary proteins. Compounds that target anyone of these viral proteins might be potential antiviral drug candidates. In this study, we focus on the viral 3CL protease, also called the main protease (M pro ), and aim to develop potent M pro inhibitors as SAR-CoV-2 antivirals. The M pro plays an essential role in coronavirus replication : bioRxiv preprint by digesting the viral polyproteins at more than 11 sites, and it appears like a high profile target for antiviral drug discovery. 7-9 The M pro has an unique substrate preference for glutamine at the P1 site (Leu-Gln\uf024(Ser,Ala,Gly)), a feature that is absent in closely related host proteases, suggesting it is feasible to achieve high selectivity by targeting viral M pro . As such, we developed the Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based enzymatic assay for the SARS-CoV-2 M pro and applied it to screen a focused library of protease inhibitors. Here we report our findings of several hits targeting SARS-CoV-2 M pro and their mechanism of action.",

The M pro protein was purified with Ni-NTA column to high purity (Fig. 1A) .

Among this series of analogs, calpain inhibitor II (61) and XII (62) are the most potent We also included two well-known viral 3CL protease inhibitors GC-376 (64) and rupintrivir (65) in the secondary screening. GC-376 (64) is an investigational veterinary drug that is being developed for feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). 10,11 GC-376 (64) was designed to target the viral 3CL protease and had potent antiviral activity against multiple viruses including MERS, FIPV, and norovirus. 10, 12 Rupintrivir (65) was developed as a rhinovirus antiviral by targeting the viral 3CL protease, but it was discontinued in clinical trials due to side effects. 13 In our study, we found that GC-376 (64) was the most potent M pro inhibitor with an IC50 value of 0.03 \u00b5M. It shifted the melting curve of M pro by 18.30 o C upon binding. In contrast, rupintrivir (65) was not active against M pro (IC50 > 20 \u00b5M).

This suggests that there is a direct correlation between the enzymatic inhibition and protein binding: a more potent enzyme inhibitor also binds to the protein with higher affinity.

With the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, scientists and researchers around the globe are racing to find effective vaccines and antiviral drugs. 24 The viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir holds the greatest promise and it is currently being evaluated in several clinical trials. 25, 26 The HIV drug combination lopinavir and ritonavir recently failed in a clinical trial for COVID-19 with no significant therapeutic efficacy was observed. 27 To address this unmet medical need, we initiated a drug repurposing screening to identify potent inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2 M pro from a collection of FDA-approved protease inhibitors. The M pro has been shown to be a validated antiviral drug target for SARS and MERS. 28 As the SARS-CoV-2 M pro shares a high sequence similarity with SARS and to a less extent with MERS, we reasoned that inhibiting the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV-2 M pro will similarly prevent viral replication. 7, 9 Noticeable findings from our study include: 1) Boceprevir (28) All potent SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors contain reactive warheads such as \u03b1-ketoamide (boceprevir (28) , calpain inhibitor XII (62)) or aldehyde (MG-132 (43), calpain inhibitor II (61)) or aldehyde prodrug, the bisulfite (GC-376 (64)). This result suggests that reactive warheads might be essential for SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibition. The compounds identified in this study represent the most potent and selective hits reported so far, and are superior than recently reported SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors ebselen, N3, and 13b (Table 5 ). Aside from the above positive results, we also showed that ritonavir (9) and lopinavir (10) In summary, this study identified several potent SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors with potent enzymatic inhibition as well as potent cellular antiviral activity. Further development based on these hits might lead to clinically useful COVID-19 antivirals. They can be used either alone or in combination with polymerase inhibitors such as remdesivir as a means to achieve potential synergic antiviral effect as well as to suppress drug resistance.

Typical coupling condition was 5 equiv of amino acid, 5 equiv of HATU, and 10 equiv of DIEA in DMF for 5 minutes at 80 o C. For deprotection, 5% piperazine plus 0.1 M HOBt were used and the mixture was heated at 80 o C for 5 minutes. The peptide was cleaved from the resin using 95% TFA, 2.5% Tris, 2.5% H2O and the crude peptide was precipitated from ether after removal of TFA. The final peptide was purified by preparative HPLC.",

In this study, we could not accurately determine the k2 for the protease inhibitors: Calpain inhibitor II, MG132, Boceprevir, and Calpain inhibitor XII, due to the very slow k2 in these case: significant substrate depletion before the establishment of the equilibrium between EI and EI*.

The therapeutic potential of boceprevir (28) should be further evaluated in relevant animal models and human clinic trials. Since boceprevir (28) is a FDA-approved drug, the dose, toxicity, formulation, and pharmacokinetic properties are already known, which will greatly speed up the design of follow up studies; 2) GC-376 (64), an investigational veterinary drug, showed promising antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus (EC50 = 3.37 \u00b5M ).
