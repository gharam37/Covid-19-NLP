We cannot heavily rely on the hypothetical prevention governed by meteorological factors such as temperature based on current evidence. From an epidemiological perspective, a longer lockdown between 42-56 days is preferable. However, the lockdown comes at a tremendous price to social and economic health through a contagion process not dissimilar to that of the coronavirus itself.

Of these, 10,815 confirmed cases are from India (Figure 1) , the world's largest democracy with a population of 1.34 billion (compare China at 1.39 billion and USA at 325.7 million). 3 India has been vigilant and wise in instituting the right public health interventions at the right time including sealing the borders with travel ban/canceling almost all visas, closing schools and colleges in certain states and diligently following up with community inspection of suspected/exposed cases with respect to adherence of quarantine recommendations ( Table 1) . On March 24, India took the historic decision of a 21-day national lockdown starting March 25, when it had reported only 536 COVID-19 cases and 11 fatalities. In the subsequent days we have seen a steady growth in the number of new cases and fatalities, with growth rates slower than other affected countries but in 21 days, the curve has not yet \"turned the corner\" or showed a steady decline in the number of newly diagnosed cases (Figure 2 ).",

According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), only 130,792 subjects have been tested as of April 9. 4 When there is no approved vaccine or drug for treating COVID-19, entering phase 2 or phase 3 of escalation will have devastating consequences on both the already overstretched healthcare system of India, and India's large at-risk sub-populations (Supplementary Table 1 ). As seen for other countries like the US or Italy, COVID-19 enters gradually and then explodes suddenly. We provide a table listing other highly affected countries along with their first reported case, initial interventions, crude fatality rates, and active case counts in Supplementary Table 2 for reference.",

Recently, this standard SIR model was extended to incorporate time-varying transmission rates or timevarying quarantine protocols and is known as the eSIR model. 11 When using the eSIR model with time-varying disease transmission rate, it can depict a series of time-varying changes caused by either external variation like government-initiated macro isolation measures, community-level protective measures and environment changes, or internal variations like mutations and evolutions of the pathogen. The R package for implementing this general model for understanding disease dynamics is publicly available at https://github.com/lilywang1988/eSIR.",

Using the current time series data on the proportions of infected and the removed people, a Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation of this Bayesian model provides not only posterior estimation on parameters and prevalence of all the three compartments in the SIR model, but also predicted proportions of the infected and the removed people at future time point. The posterior mean estimates of the unobserved prevalence at both observed as well as future time points come along with 95% credible intervals (CI).

For the short-term forecast on April 30, we assumed lockdown is implemented until April 14 with either a 1-or a 2-week delay in people's adherence/compliance to lockdown restrictions. We compared these projections with two hypothetical scenarios: (A) no nonpharmaceutical intervention (i.e., a constant disease transmission rate over time since the first case was reported in India), (B) a moderate intervention with social distancing and travel bans only (i.e., a decreased transmission rate compared to no intervention). For the no intervention and the moderate intervention scenarios, we chose the transmission rate and the removal rate such that the means for the prior distribution of the basic reproductive number R0 (the expected number of cases generated by one infected person assuming that the whole population is susceptible) are 2.0 and 1.5 respectively [the change in R0 was created based on what we saw in Wuhan 16 ]. The value of 2.0 was estimated based on the early phase data in India. For the current scenario of lockdown, our chosen mean for R0 prior starts with 2.0 during the period of no intervention, drops to 1.5 during the period of moderate intervention, and further drops to 0.8 during the 21-day lockdown period, and moves back up to 1.5 after the lockdown ends as described in Figure 3 (assuming a gradual, moderate resumption of daily activities).",

We are reporting only the upper credible limit here and elsewhere since the lower credible limits are very close to 0 due to the large uncertainty in our predictions arising from many unknowns. We also believe that our point estimates are at best underestimates due to potential under-reporting of case-counts and our model not taking into account the population density, agesex and contact network structure of the whole nation.

When comparing a 21-day lockdown with a hypothetical lockdown of longer duration, we find that 28-, 42-, and 56-day lockdowns can approximately prevent 238 thousand (upper 95% CI 2.3 million), 622 thousand (upper 95% CI 4.3 million), 781 thousand (upper 95% CI 4.6 million) cases by June 15, respectively. A 28-day lockdown does not appear to have a significant impact on cumulative case counts when compared to a 21-day lockdown. However, purely from an epidemiologic perspective, there appears to be some evidence that suggests a 42-or 56-day lockdown would have a more meaningful impact on reducing cumulative COVID-19 case counts in India. We note that longer lockdown periods are accompanied by increasing costs to individuals -notably economicand must be considered. Our models suggest that some form of post-lockdown suppression (e.g., extension of social distancing measures, limits of gathering size, etc.) is necessary to observe longterm benefits of the lockdown period.",

In one example, we assumed that there are actually 10 times the number of reported cases to date to reflect potential underreporting of cases due to lack of testing. In another scenario, we assumed these cases occurred in metropolitan areas to reflect a potential intensification of case clustering. In yet a third scenario, we hypothesized that R0 prior starts with 2.5 instead of 2.0 (i.e., a single infected individual would infect 2.5 susceptible individuals, on average, instead of 2). These scenarios did not appreciably change our conclusions in broad qualitative terms, though the exact quantitative projections are quite sensitive to such choices. Across these scenarios, the projected total number of infected cases by the entire first phase of the pandemic varied between 2-15% of the population, again showing the significant variability in these numbers. The estimates we present here may appear conservative and are at best underestimates, and, in all cases, our confidence in these projections decreases markedly the farther into the future we try to forecast.

In the long-term, we need to have some measures of suppression in place after the lockdown is lifted to prevent a massive surge in the number of cases that can quickly overwhelm an already over-stretched Indian healthcare system resulting in increased fatalities. Specific vulnerable populations will be at higher risk of severity and fatality from COVID-19 infection: older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (e.g., high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer, diabetes, immunocompromised persons). 24,25 Supplementary Table 1 provides a description of the approximate number of individuals in these high-risk categories in India. Beyond the fragile population characterized by health and economic indicators, we have to remember that healthcare workers and first responders at the front line of this pandemic are amongst the most vulnerable. 16 It is important to note that a massive surge in the number of cases can quickly overwhelm an already over-stretched Indian healthcare system. The estimated capacity of hospital beds in India is 70 per 100,000, 26 which is an upper bound on treatment capacity. Given an average occupancy rate of 75%, only a quarter of these are available. 27 Moreover, critically ill COVID-19 patients (about 5-10% of those infected) will require ICU beds and ventilator support. India has only 35-58 thousand ICU beds with very high occupancy rates and at most 1 ventilator per 2 ICU beds. 28 From a purely public health perspective, this analysis shows the impact and necessity of lockdown and subsequent measures of suppression after lockdown is lifted. All the people in India, regardless of their vulnerability to COVID-19, need to adhere to the public health guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in India, and continue to be cautious in their post-lockdown activities to guarantee a long-term benefit of the national lockdown.",

COVID-19 hotspots in India are not uniformly spread across the country, and state-level forecasts 43 may be more meaningful for state-level policymaking. We are assuming that the implementation and effects of public health interventions and policies are the same everywhere in India by treating India as a homogeneous unit. Future opportunities for improving our model include incorporating contagion network, age-structure, estimating SEIR model, incorporating test imperfection, and estimating true fatality/death rates. Regardless of the caveats in our study, our analyses show the impact and necessity of lockdown and of suppressed activity post-lockdown in India.
