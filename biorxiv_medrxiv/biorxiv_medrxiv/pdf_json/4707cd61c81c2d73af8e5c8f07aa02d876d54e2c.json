In the absence of a cure or a vaccine and given the nature of the virus transmission, drastic measures need to be implemented to reduce contacts and \"flatten\" the epidemic curve. As quarantine and social distancing are enforced, it is important to understand the impact of early release or relaxation of such interventions on the affected population. We use a mathematical model which explicitly considers a NPI such as sheltering in place or social distancing, similar to what has been widely implemented in several countries around the world. We calculate the effect on the epidemic of removing intervention as a function of time. The use of drastic NPI strategies in China reportedly reduced the basic reproductive number, R 0 , to a value smaller than 1, strongly curbing the epidemic within a short period of time [2] . In other countries, the implementation of such policies has not been as strict [3] , with an optimistic reduction in transmission by about half. To complicate the containment of the disease, early reports of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections have emerged [4, 7] , with estimates of asymptomatic transmission of as much as 85% of all cases, and 55% per person. These predictions have been supported by recent studies [18] . The US CDC estimates the population of asymptomatic infections to 25% of all cases [5] .",

We compare the model and its predictions with the outcomes of a basic SEIR model (that fails to model asymptomatic individuals), which demonstrate that the basic model (SEIR) can not adequately predict the dynamics of Sars-CoV-2 (see Figure 16 ). For example, when the transmission from asymptomatic individuals differs from symptomatic ones, we show that applying a reproductive number that accounts for both groups leads to significant error in predicted clinical infectious cases by the simple SEIR model. Conversely, adjusting the SEIR model parameters to correctly account for the total reported cases forces significant error in R o and incorrect timing for the epidemic wave.

Current estimations of the disease basic reproduction number, R 0 , put a realistic value between 2 and 3 [3, 6]. In our analysis, we use a baseline value of R 0 = 2 (as a best case assumption). We also assume that implementations of control reduces transmission by 25% to 50%. The actual parameter values may differ and are still under investigations. However, the parameters we choose reflect a realistic scenario of transmission and are informative with regard to control strategies. Using these best case parameter, we then compute the additional cases that will occur as a function of the time when interventions are removed. The data suggests that decision to remove public health interventions can and should be informed by an analysis such as the one reported here. The fact that the epidemic curve is past its peak does not protect against a second wave so long as a large reservoir of unvaccinated susceptible population remains.",

Because of mild or no symptomatology, transmission from these asymptomatic carriers happens at a higher contact rate than symptomatic individuals. We parameterize these cases with the effective contact rate (transmission rate) \u03b2 2 , different from the transmission rate from symptomatic infectious, defined as \u03b2 1 .

Of course, while a delay in the peak is observed, which may buy the health care system time to respond, the reduction in the number of total infectious is marginal. When NPI is removed at the epidemic peak (figure 1(b)), a secondary peak is observed, showing an increase in total number of infected. Lastly, when control is released after the peak (at a late stage of epidemic shown in figure 1(c)), for t \u2248 0.5 years, we observe the emergence of a kink in the descending part of the curve, but not a full fledged resurgence of the disease.

We assume that testing captures only a part of the asymptomatic population, indicated as A 1 . Testing susceptible and recovered has no effect on the epidemic curve, but detecting asymptomatic cases requires significant random sampling. We further assume that widespread testing effectively removes A 1 asymptomatic individuals from the population transmitting the disease through self isolation or quarantine. We model this removed A 1 population fraction by assuming an increased recovery rate for this class (since isolation is akin to removal). A fraction A 2 is not tested and will be able to spread the virus upon release of NPI as before. It is informative to consider the case of testing both with and without social distancing. We imagine two scenarios: In the first scenario, as soon as the first confirmed case is reported, a fraction of the population is tested but no social distancing is implemented. This is reported in Figures 5 and 7. The cumulative incidence for this scenario is shown in Figures 6 and 8 for 25%",

Our simulations clearly show that, absent testing of a significant fraction of the population (both symptomatic and asymptomatic), early release of NPI will cause a resurgence of the epidemic. This suggests the fundamental role of widespread testing in any policy of NPI release. As suggested by recent publications [18] , when universal testing is administered, asymptomatic individuals are found to make up for a large majority of all identified cases. As such, widespread testing policies must target this population rather than only individuals with evidence of influenza-like or SARS-like symptoms.",

Adjusting their behavior to avoid those who are contagious leads to a dynamic network where the connections depend on the state of the population of individuals. That is, the network of contacts is one that is adaptive [11] . Although there does not exist a vaccine currently, when one will be introduced, it will initially be a limited resource. Continuing controls, such as those adaptive contacts in which people can avoid contagious individuals, can greatly help with the extinction of disease [12] , especially in the presence of limited vaccines. Combining large scale testing, continued social distancing, along with vaccine control increases the probability of being able to bring the COVID19 6 .
