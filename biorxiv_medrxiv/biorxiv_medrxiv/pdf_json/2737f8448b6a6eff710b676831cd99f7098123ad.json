In this paper, we described the epidemiological characteristics of the laboratory-confirmed patients with Covid-2019 in the Philippines as of April 3, 2020 and provided recommendations on how to limit the spread of the disease. Data from the DOH NCOV tracker and University of the Philippines' Covid-2019 tracker were extracted, from its initiation (January 30, 2020) until the most recent situation report (April 3, 2020). The total number of cases and deaths were stratified by sex, age, and region of the Philippines. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the demographic profile of the confirmed cases. Case fatality rate, in percent, was calculated by dividing the total number of deaths to the total number of confirmed cases. Results revealed that a total of 3,018 cases of Covid-2019 spread were confirmed across 17 regions in the Philippines. These cases occurred over the course of 73 days through person-to-person transmission, highlighting an extremely high infectivity rate. The 144 deaths accounted for, equate to 4.51 case fatality rate, seemingly lower compared to its predecessors, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but higher compared to that of United States of America, Germany, mainland China, and neighboring Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, and Thailand. Of the 3,018 confirmed cases, majority were male, elderly, and diagnosed in Metro Manila region. Case fatality rates were higher in male and highest among elderly and Filipinos in the Ilocos region. With the surge on the number of cases, precautionary measures should remain a responsibility, and protocols for prevention need to be set. Adherence to infection control guidelines such as but not limited to frequently handwashing for at least 20 seconds, observing coughing etiquette, wearing of masks, and social distancing should be maintained in order to contain the disease.",

            "text": "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-2019) is a source of great concern in the Philippines. It was first confirmed to have spread in the country on January 30, 2020 in Manila, Philippines. Involved first and second cases were married couples who had travel history in China, one of which was the first confirmed fatality of the disease in the country. The first case of local transmission was reported in an area in Northern Philippines from an elderly Filipino who was frequently observed in a Muslim prayer hall. He was the first confirmed death due to the local transmission of the disease in the country. 1 Until April 3, 2020, Covid-2019 has affected 3,018 individuals and caused 144 deaths in the Philippines, and quickly spread to over 17 regions nationwide. A total of 5,530 persons had been tested, while persons under investigation and under monitoring rose up to 1,323 and 6,321, respectively. Persons under investigation (PUIs) is a category for persons who have fever and/or cough with either a travel history in the past 14 days to areas with issued travel restrictions because of Covid-2019 and/or a history of disease exposure while persons under monitoring (PUMs) refers to individuals who have a travel history in the past 14 days to areas with issued travel restrictions because of Covid-2019 and/or a history of disease exposure. During a three-month duration of pandemic, the highest number of daily cases (538) was recorded on March 31, 2020. 1 Several health measures have been instigated to combat the disease outbreak. Few laboratories have opened to test for suspected cases. Among which are Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) which is located in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila and sub-national laboratories in Davao, Cebu and Northern Luzon, among others. Travel bans have been imposed to hotspot areas of the disease such as mainland China and South Korea. On March 9, Philippine President Rodrigo R. Duterte declared a public health emergency in the country after signing the Proclamation No. 922. On March 12, the Code Red Sub-Level 1 alert was raised to Code Red Sub-Level 2 alert to prevent further local transmission of the disease. As part of the concerted disease-mitigating efforts, the entire Luzon and some areas in the country have been placed in an enhanced community quarantine on March 16, after releasing a memorandum to suspend classes on March 12. In an attempt to authorize the President of the country 'to exercise powers necessary to carry out urgent measures to meet the current national emergency related to Covid-19', the President signed the 'Bayanihan to Heal as One Act' on March 25. Moreover, the Department of Health (DOH) of the country is accelerating its Covid-19 testing capacity, anticipating 120,500 kits from neighboring countries. 2 Infection control measures and supportive treatment were the current recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 3, 4 Up to the present moment, there are no known vaccines for Covid-2019. This prompted several scientists in the world to evaluate the effectiveness of previously used treatments for SARS such as lopinavir.",

This distribution could be attributed to the geographical nature and the population of Metro Manila. Presently, Metro Manila is the seat of the Philippine government, comprising of 16 cities. It is the second most populous and the most densely populated region of the Philippines, next to Calabarzon. Meanwhile, Ilocos area had the highest case fatality rate at 11.11%, followed by Bangsamoro at 10.00% and Central Luzon at 6.76%. Ilocos Region, occupying the north-western area of the Philippines, issued several directives to combat the daunting case fatality rate. Among which were the provisions for the preparation of health information forms, identification of quarantine areas, delineated rules for the business establishments, prohibition of the spreading of fake news, regulation of ports and borders, personal and public preventive measures, and prohibition of hoarding, reselling, and price spikes. 10 Despite the concerted efforts in battling the Covid-2019 pandemic, precautionary measures remain a responsibility, and protocols for prevention need to be set, regardless of the relatively favourable prognosis of this disease, when compared with SARS and MERS.
