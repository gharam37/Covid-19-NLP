The S-glycoprotein, which recognized as the key factor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell, contains two functional domains: an ACE2 receptor binding domain and a second domain necessary for fusion of the coronavirus and cell membranes. FURIN activity, exposes the binding and fusion domains, is essential for the zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it has been reported that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, FURIN enzyme and ACE2 receptor were expressed in airway epithelia, cardiac tissue, and enteric canals, which considered as the potential target organ of the virus.",

Previous findings indicated that the ACE2 plays an important role in cellular entry, thus ACE2-expressing cells may act as target cells and are susceptible to COVID-19 infection [2, 8, 9, 10,] . Besides, ACE2 receptor was proven to be expressed in 72 human tissues, and is abundantly present in the epithelia of the lung and small intestines [11] . Studies also found ACE2 expression in the epithelial layer of nasal and oral mucosa. However, this conclusion was based on the bulk RNA datasets.

Genomic characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) have revealed that FURIN enzyme could activate the specific site of its spike protein [13] . Meanwhile, Li H. et. al revealed that a putative FURIN-cleavage site reported recently in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the virus-cell fusion, which can explain the virus transmission features [14] . In addition, Ma Y and co-authors found that presence of FURIN cleavage site, which is absent in other coronavirus, during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause some distinct clinical symptoms from SARS-CoV infection [15] . Similar results were also reported in Li X.'s study from China [16] . Hence, the expression and distribution of ACE2 and FURIN in human body were the key factors for the coronavirus to invade host cells. Furthermore, online single-cell sequence datasets analysis unveiled that FURIN was expressed in coronavirus's potential target organs, such as lung, heart, nose, rectum, colon, intestine and ileum [14] . However, information on the expression and distribution of ACE2 and FURIN in oral cavity were limited.",

It captures cellular differences underlying tumor biology at a higher resolution than regular bulk RNA-seq and has revolutionized studies of cancer mechanisms and personalized medicine [ 20 ] . For better understanding the potential infection risk in oral cavity, we explored whether the ACE2 and FURIN were expressed and their expressing cells composition and proportion in different oral tissues based on the public scRNA-seq profiles from GEO public databases.

However, these studies were based on public databases and were not analyzed together, and further validation of protein levels was lacking. In the current study, we firstly characterized the ACE2 protein expression profiles in five different oral tissues through immunohistochemical staining experiment. Results indicated that ACE2 was mainly present in epithelial cells in all included tissues, especially in buccal mucosa, lip and tongue. Previous study discovered the similar result [21] . Overall, these results demonstrated that, compared with other oral sites, buccal mucosa, lip and tongue might be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.",

Other research teams have also identified this activation site, suggesting that it may enable the virus to spread effectively between humans [13] . It has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 could fuse with cell membrane and then entry into the target cells [ 27 , 28 ] . Researchers have found FURIN proteases in many tissues, including the lungs, liver, and small intestine [29] . However, limited reports were seen Previous analysis about the SARS-CoV-2 receptor in the sing cell level were based on the complete OSCC database named GS103322, which was significantly different from the genetic profiles of normal oral tissues [30] . In order to accurately analyzing the expression status of FURIN in the gene level, datasets from five OSCC patients, which were graded as 1 and T1N0 stage were selected originated from the online platform in the present research. The obtained single cell RNA-seq data were processed and analyzed with R software. As expected, FURIN were found abundantly enriched in oral mucosa cells, particularly in epithelial cells and the proportion of FURIN-positive cells was higher than that of ACE2-positive cells.",

For further validating the results in the gene level, FURIN immunohistochemistry was therefore performed on conventional sections for the first time to assess its expression in oral mucosa obtained from five different sites. It is noteworthy that moderate positive expression of FURIN protein were observed in tongue, giniva and lip, while weakly positive in the buccal and palatal tissues. As a result, we speculated that SARS-CoV-2 could fuse with the FURIN enzyme on the cell membrane the oral mucosal cells, then entry into the host cells. Alternatively, FURIN could be recognised as the potential drug target of suppressing the infection of new coronavirus.",

Large proportion of endopeptidases positive cells in the different oral sites provided opportunities for SARS-CoV-2 infection and rapid replication in the oral cavity [15] .
