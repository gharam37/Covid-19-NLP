The identification of these clusters allowed the health authorities to quarantine close contacts for effective intervention and provided an opportunity to study the characteristics of where and how these clusters occurred. The first COVID-2019 patient was identified in Wuhan in December 2019, and the largest number of confirmed Chinese cases occurred in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the provincial capital. 2 Since 20 January 2020, the local health authorities of cities outside Hubei have reported online the details of most identified cases of infections.",

Many described cases also included the individual trajectory and relationship with other confirmed cases, and quite often clusters had already been identified. We consulted the websites nationwide except for those of cities in Hubei province and collected all available data up to 11 February 2020. Data from a few major cities -Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhouwere not included in our analysis due to insufficient case descriptions.

We defined an outbreak as a cluster in which a common index patient is suspected, and we excluded tertiary and highergeneration infections in counting the number of cases involved. We also excluded outbreaks that involved only two cases to exclude possible spouse-to-spouse transmission and to reduce the workload due to the large number of clusters or outbreaks with two cases.

Our estimated home dominance of 79\u00b79% is close to the official estimate of 83% of the so-called household clusters among the nearly 1000 clusters (not outbreaks) defined by the China National Health Commission. 4 After Wuhan announced its city lockdown on 23 January, the warning message spread throughout the country. People in provinces outside Hubei also began to stay at home. Most Chinese families have one child, and some families may also include grandparents. The relatively low number of cases in these home outbreaks might be considered an advantage of compulsory home quarantine because transmission was limited to the small number of family members. Similar stay-athome policies have now been implemented elsewhere during the pandemic.",

This feature contrasts with the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic, during which 7 major super-spreading events in Hong Kong and Singapore alone were identified to involve as many as 329 cases, and super-spreading events dominated the epidemic. 6 The occurrence of many small outbreaks (in number of cases) in the COVID-19 pandemic suggests a different transmission pattern from that of the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic.

Most health authorities advised that the COVID-19 virus is transmitted mainly by close contact and via the fomite route (e.g., China NHC 7 and CDC 8 ). The China NHC also suggested that longrange aerosol transmission may occur when certain conditions are met, such as in crowded enclosures or spaces with poor ventilation. Frequent close contact occurs and high touch surfaces exist in buildings. 9-12 We do not have data on the hygiene conditions and human density of the infection venues of the 318 outbreaks studied here. The exact location of the infection venues and the necessary parameters such as the floor area or the number of occupants were not provided in the case reports. Instead, we reviewed the current design standards of thermal and ventilation conditions, occupant density and close contact behaviour in the various indoor environments discussed here (Table S3 ). The required ventilation rates vary significantly among homes, offices, trains, and buses. For example, the required ventilation rate is only 3\u00b79 L/s per person in shopping malls and 2\u00b78 L/s per person in public buses, whereas a ventilation rate of 8 to 10 L/s is required for good indoor air quality. 26 An international systematic review showed that a rate as high as 25 L/s per person may be needed. 13 Many existing buildings are crowded, poorly ventilated, and unhygienic. A comprehensive review of ventilation conditions in Chinese indoor environments by Ye et al. 14 showed that the CO2 concentration can reach 3,500 ppm in some buildings. The design and operation of buildings have also been under pressure to reduce energy use 15 and increase human productivity. Balancing the need for energy efficiency, indoor environment, and health in both urban planning and building design has not been easy. 16 The quality of indoor environments might be sacrificed by putting a greater focus on cost than on health.",

The world's first statutory housing policy, the Artisans and Labourers Dwellings Act 1875 21 was developed following 19 th century empirical evidence that crowding led to a high incidence of infectious disease. A recent systematic review by the World Health Organization also found an association between crowding and infection. 22 A Lancet editorial in 2018 declared '[t]he right to a healthy home'. 23 One WHO meeting also declared that 'everyone has the right to breathe healthy indoor air' 24 and that 'the provision of healthy indoor air should not compromise global or local ecological integrity, or the rights of future generations'. 25 We hope that in the post-pandemic future, mankind will reflect deeply on the need for a healthy indoor environment.

The mall was opened again on 5 March. (21), Tianjin Based on our collected data, 21 cases were involved. According to Wu et al. (2020) , 25 cases were involved. Six shop workers and nine customers in a shopping centre were infected, with onset dates between 20 January (a shop assistant) and 3 February (a customer). The shopping complex was built in 1981, with a 4,000 m 2 shopping area, mainly on the first and second floors. There were 213 workers including shop assistants. People were purchasing clothes and gifts before CNY, so the shop was very crowded with at least 10,000 visitors to the venue during the possible infectious periods. The outbreak mainly occurred on the first floor, where clothes, shoes, jewellery, and small appliances are sold. The building was closed on 26 January. All rights reserved.
