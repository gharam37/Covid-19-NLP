The first models mainly focused on the estimation of the basic reproduction number R 0 using dynamic mechanistic mathematical models ( [4, 5, 6, 7] ), but also simple exponential growth models (see e.g. [8, 9] ). Compartmental epidemiological models like SIR, SIRD, SEIR and SEIRD have been proposed to estimate other important epidemiological 40 parameters, such as the transmission rate and for forecasting purposes (see e.g. [7, 10] ). Other studies have used metapopulation models, which include data of human mobility between cities and/or regions to forecast the evolution of the outbreak in other regions/countries far from the original epicenter in China large percentage of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases experiencing the disease like the common cold or the flu (see e.g. [14] ), and (b) the uncertainty regarding the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak, the knowledge of which is crucial to assess the stage and dynamics of the epidemic, especially during the first growth period. 55 To cope with the above problems, we herein propose a SEIRD with two compartments, one modelling the total infected cases in the population and another modelling the confirmed cases. The proposed modelling approach is applied to Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, to estimate the scale of under-reporting of the number of actual cases in the total population, 60 the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak and for forecasting purposes. The above tasks were accomplished by the numerical solution of a mixed-integer optimization problem using the publicly available data of daily new cases for the period ",

The numerical optimization pro-210 cedure was repeated 48 times for each combination of initial guesses. For our computations, we kept the best fitting outcome for each combination of initial guesses. Next we fitted the resulting cumulative probability distributions of the optimal values using several functions including the Normal, Log-normal, Weibull, Beta, Gamma, Burr, Exponential and Birnbaum-Saunders distribu-215 tions and kept the one resulting in the maximum Log-likelihood (see in the Supporting Information for more details). For the computed parameters of the corresponding best distributions, we also provide the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Note, that the expected values of the resulting distributions do not correspond to optimal values, due to the approximation that is introduced 220 by the fitting procedure; however they correspond to expected/ most probable values around which an optimal solution is sought. Thus, for that purpose, we have used as initial guesses the mean values of the resulting distributions to the Levenberg-Marquard (implemented by the \"lsqnonlin\" function of matlab [23] ) to find the optimal solution around this \"representative point\" as well the 225 corresponding 95% confidence intervals.

Furthermore, our analysis revealed that the actual cumulative number of infected cases in the total population in the period until400 March 8 was around 15 times the cumulative number of confirmed infected cases.

For the DAY-ZERO, the best fit to the distribution of the optimal values was obtained by the Normal CDF:",
