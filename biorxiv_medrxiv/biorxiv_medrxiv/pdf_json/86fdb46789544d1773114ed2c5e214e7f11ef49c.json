The virus spread rapidly around the world, and in March of 2019 the disease was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. At the time of writing, 1.3 million people around the world have been infected and more than 70,000 people have died from the disease, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition to the public health crisis, the economic impact from the pandemic continues to worsen. Due to the novelty of the virus, no approved vaccines or treatments are available. There is therefore an urgent need for the development of new countermeasures.",

The virus was subsequently titrated and passaged once more on Vero cells, grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin solution. All experiments were conducted at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) approved biosafety level-three (BSL-3) laboratories and all personnel undergo routine medical surveillance. Compound pretreatment and infection Vero cells were pretreated, 1 mL per well, with DMEM media containing the indicated concentrations of either merimepodib or T-705 and incubated at 37\u00b0C for either 4 hours or overnight. The media was then removed and cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.05. Viral inoculum was premixed with compounds (0.1 mL/well). After 1 hour of incubation at 37\u00b0C, wells were washed 3 times with DMEM media and 1 mL of media containing the indicated compound doses was added back to each well. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C and samples collected at 0, 16, and 24 hours post-infection. Collected timepoint media was replaced with an equal amount of media containing compound. The SARS-CoV-2 titer was determined for each sample collected at 0, 16, and 24 hours post-infection via TCID50 in Vero cells. Briefly, collected supernatant was serially diluted six times (10-6) in DMEM media.",

At both 16 and 24 hours post-infection, during the exponential phase of the viral growth curve, 10 \u03bcM MMPD reduced viral titers by around 3 logs when cells were pretreated overnight (p-value = <0.0001). 4 hours of pretreatment with MMPD resulted in a nearly 2.5-log decrease in viral titers (p-value = 0.0004). The antiviral effect is dose-dependent, with lower doses of 5 and 3.3 \u03bcM of MMPD reducing viral titers by a more modest, but still significant degree. At 24 hours post-infection, 5 \u03bcM MMPD applied 4 hours before infection reduced viral titers by 1.5 logs (pvalue = 0.0004), while 3.3 \u03bcM added 4 hours before infection reduced viral titers by a little over 1 log (p-value = 0.001).",
