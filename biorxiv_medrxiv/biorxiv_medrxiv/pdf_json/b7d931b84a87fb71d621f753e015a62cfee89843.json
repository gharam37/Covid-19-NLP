To connect both patients to one ventilator we applied two simple straight polyoxymethylene adaptors of 22 mm (equivalent to 0.866 in) inner diameter ( Figure 1 ) to link the ventilator's inspiratory and expiratory out-and inlet to Y-pieces which on their part connected two respiratory tubing systems with the ventilator. Each of the tubing systems was connected to the patient model via an endotracheal tube of 7.0 mm inner diameter (Mallinckrodt, Hi-Contour, Covidien, Dublin, Ireland). In our experiments we investigated all possible combinations of respiratory system compliances of 30, 40, 50 and 60 ml/cmH2O. Every combination was investigated as follows: first, the respective compliance of each compartment was set independently. Then they were connected collectively to the ventilator. Pressure controlled ventilation was started with PEEP 14 cmH20, which is part of the treatment standard of SARS-COV-2 ARDS in our facility. Ventilation frequency was set to 18 breaths per minute and peak pressure was set to generate a tidal volume of 850 to 1000 ml, corresponding to a tidal volume of 5.7 to 6.7 ml/kg for a patient of 75 kg body weight.

For an additional measurement using external sensors pneumotachographs (Fleisch2, Dr Fenyves & Gut, Hechingen) were placed between the breathing circuits' outlets and the tracheal tube. The pressures inside the lung models were measured via piezoresistive pressure sensors (Transmittermodul Typ 4, SI-special instruments GmbH, N\u00f6rdlingen, Germany). After a measurement sequence of at least 8 complete breaths one patient model was disconnected from the ventilator via pinching off the tracheal tube of one patient using a surgical clamp of which the jaws were coated with a silicone tube to prevent from damaging the tracheal tube.

Furthermore, to prevent oxygen desaturation of the disconnected patient, it may be recommendable to perform the pinch of the tracheal tube at the end of inspiration, when pressure is high.
