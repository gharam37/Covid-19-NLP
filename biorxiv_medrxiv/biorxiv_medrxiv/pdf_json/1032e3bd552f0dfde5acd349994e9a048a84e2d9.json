We consider adaptation of CPAP systems typically used for sleep apnoea, together with a new Venturi-valve design which can be readily produced through 3D printing. Our aim in both cases was to support Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of \u226510cmH2O while achieving \u226540% FiO2. This supports a crucial part in the patient pathway for COVID-19 treatment, helping to provide early respiratory support prior to invasive ventilation options in the ICU.",

In CPAP mode, the system generates 3-20 cmH20 (0.3-2.0kPa) using an internal centrifugal fan to pressurise atmospheric air. This offers the possibility to entrain O2 either at the system's low pressure air inlet, or in the pressurised air-stream near the ventilation mask as shown in Figure 1 . We modified a standard Nippy 3+ system to allow entrainment of oxygen at the intake port and evaluated the efficacy of these two approaches.

The flow generator can be purely mechanical without moving parts; the Venturi effect occurring within a carefully designed valve allows a high pressure oxygen source to entrain and mix air into the breathing circuit. Whilst mechanically simple, these devices can be inefficient in their use of oxygen unless carefully designed. Venturi systems are commonly used in hospitals to provide controlled oxygen therapy without CPAP pressure, however a valve can be designed to cope with both the pressures and flows required for CPAP therapy [7] . While commercial Venturi systems exist, their availability has been limited due to supply-chain challenges during the pandemic. In this resource-limited context, 3D printing provides an ideal alternative means to produce Venturi systems in an agile and timely manner.",

Careful design of the valve is required to ensure the pressure requirements are met with previous computational and experimental studies used to guide the design [8] . The L-Vent design was achieved through iterative development in which candidate valves were evaluated for ease of 3D printing and clinical performance in a simple CPAP breathing circuit, as shown in Figure 2 .

The difference in performance can be attributed to the single-arm breathing circuit in which air-flow is reversed during the expiration phase and part of the air column is vented to atmosphere. This results in losses of oxygen when entraining at the air intake, but entrainment near the patient benefits from the pressurised air-column created between the patient and HEPA filter, which acts as a 'buffer' to preserve oxygen and avoid losses. Although this testing model precludes gas exchange, it is representative of the relative performance of these two configurations and suggests that relatively low flow-rates of oxygen can be used to obtain therapeutic FiO2 levels and that these can be readily altered by altering the oxygen flow-rate.",

We have shown that this can be achieved both through the repurposing of NIV ventilation systems and using a novel 3D-printed Venturi system with a standard PEEP-valve breathing circuit. These solutions bring different merits in clinical performance and efficiency, but provide resource-limited healthcare providers with flexible treatment pathways that can be rapidly deployed to reduce the burden on ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
