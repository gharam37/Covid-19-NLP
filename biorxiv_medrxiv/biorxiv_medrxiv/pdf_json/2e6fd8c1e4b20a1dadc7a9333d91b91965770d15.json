            "text": "Whether a pathogen entering a new host species results in a single infection or in onward 7 transmission, and potentially an outbreak, depends upon the progression of infection in the index 8 case. Although index infections are rarely observable in nature, experimental inoculations of 9 pathogens into novel host species have a long history in biomedical research. This provides a rich 10 and largely unexploited data source for meta-analyses to identify the host and pathogen 11 determinants of variability in infection outcomes. Here, we analysed the progressions of 514 12 experimental cross-species inoculations of rabies virus, a widespread zoonotic pathogen which in 13 nature exhibits both dead end infections and varying levels of sustained transmission in novel hosts. 14 Inoculations originating from bats rather than carnivores, and from warmer to cooler-bodied 15 species caused infections with shorter incubation periods that were associated with diminished 16 virus excretion. Inoculations between distantly related hosts tended to result in shorter clinical 17 disease periods, which will also impede transmission. All effects were modulated by infection dose 18 and together suggest that increased virulence as host species become more dissimilar is the limiting 19 factor preventing onward transmission. These results explain observed constraints on rabies virus 20 host shifts, allow us to evaluate the risk of novel reservoirs establishing, and give mechanistic 21 insights into why host shifts are less likely between genetically distant species. More generally, our 22 study highlights meta-analyses of experimental infections as a tractable approach to quantify the 23 complex interactions between virus, reservoir, and novel host that shape the outcome of cross-24 species transmission.",

            "text": "Emerging disease epidemics often result from a pathogen establishing transmission in a novel host 27 species. However, most cross-species transmissions fail to establish in the newly infected species 28 for reasons that remain poorly understood. Examining cross-species inoculations involving rabies, 29 a widespread viral zoonosis, we show that mismatches in virulence, which are predictable from 30 host and viral factors, make sustained transmission in the novel host less likely. In particular, 31 disease progression was accelerated and virus excretion decreased when the reservoir and novel 32 host were physiologically or genetically more dissimilar. These mechanistic insights help to 33 explain and predict host shift events and highlight meta-analyses of existing experimental 34 inoculation data as a powerful and generalisable approach for understanding the dynamics of index 35 infections in novel species. Features inherent to the virus lineage involved (virus effects), irrespective of the infected 91 host, likely due to adaptation of individual lineages to reservoir host species. For example, 92 incubation periods were shortened by both increased dose and by inoculation routes which were 125 closer to the brain, although the effect size estimate for inoculation distance included zero ( Figure  126 2A). More importantly, the duration of incubation periods was also influenced by features of the 127 virus as well as its interaction with the inoculated host. Specifically, significant differences in 128 incubation period duration were associated with reservoir type (bat vs. carnivore) and with body 129 temperature differences between source and inoculated hosts (Figure 2A ). Both effects depended 130 on viral dose. At low doses, viruses from bat reservoirs were associated with shorter incubation 131 periods compared to viruses from carnivores, though this effect diminished at higher doses ( Figure  132 2B). A similar effect was seen when the inoculated species was a known rabies reservoir ( Figure  133 2C) although the 95% highest posterior density interval (HPD) of this effect size included zero 134 ( Figure 2A ). The difference in typical body temperature between the virus reservoir and the 135 inoculated species had a more marked effect on incubation period durations ( Figure 2A ). The onset 136 of symptoms was delayed when the virus was inoculated into species with a warmer body 137 temperature than its reservoir (negative values in Figure 2D ), although this delay reduced with 138 higher doses. The opposite was also true -in hosts with lower body temperatures than the virus 139 reservoir, the incubation period tended to be shorter ( Figure 2D , Supplementary figure S 1). Models 140 fitting effects for inoculated and reservoir species body temperature separately allowed us to 141 explore this temperature effect further. Inoculated species with higher typical body temperatures 142 tended to have longer incubation periods (Supplementary figure S 2). However, viruses from 143 reservoirs with higher body temperatures were associated with shorter incubation periods, 144 suggesting that these viruses had adapted to counteract any losses in efficiency caused by the body 145 temperature of their reservoir host. Importantly, there was no correlation between phylogenetic 146 distance and body temperature difference among species (Supplementary figure S 3), indicating 147 that the observed temperature effects were not explainable by the level of taxonomic relatedness 148 among species. All fixed effects combined explained 19.2% of the variation in incubation period 149 durations (HPD: 2.8 -40.2%). 150",

Cross-species inoculations between 156 phylogenetically more distant species were associated with an increased sensitivity to high viral 157 doses, resulting in shorter clinical periods ( Figure 2E ). However, the overall effect size estimate 158 for this interaction included zero (Figure 2A ). Bat-associated viruses appeared to have shorter 159 clinical periods, and -as also observed for incubation periods -this effect depended on dose, but 160 here it was poorly estimated, with the HPD again including zero ( Figure 2A ).

The remaining residual correlation 176 is explained by differences in dose ( Figure 3C ), with higher doses leading to decreased salivary 177 gland titres ( Figure 3D ). The inoculation of species with a lower body temperature than the 178 reservoir also tended to reduce the virus titre in the salivary glands, although the size of this effect 179 could not be estimated precisely enough to make it distinct from zero (positive body temperature 180 differences, Figure 3D & E). A clearer effect was observed for the interaction of reservoir status 181 and dose: at low doses, known rabies reservoir species produced higher virus titres in the salivary 182 glands than non-reservoirs ( Figure 3G ). At very high doses, however, we detected no difference in 183 salivary gland titres, possibly because animals succumb too fast for any differences to develop. 184 .

Viruses such 38 as West Nile virus, rabies virus and Lassa virus cause tens of thousands of human infections 39 annually through transmission from animal reservoirs (Chancey et al., 2015; Hampson et al., 2015; 40 The potential for sustained onward transmission of rabies virus is likely to depend on the incubation 68 period (from bite to the appearance of clinical signs) and the duration of clinical signs prior to death 69 (here, the clinical period) of infected hosts. Longer incubation periods are associated with greater 70 distribution of virus through the central nervous system (Fekadu et al., 1982), spread to a wider 71 range of tissues (Davis et al., 2013), and higher virus titres in the salivary glands, all of which 72 should facilitate onward transmission (Baer and Bales, 1967). Conversely, faster progression of 73 infection has been associated with lower virus excretion, and in extreme cases animals die before 74 the virus reaches the salivary glands, making transmission highly unlikely (Baer and Bales, 1967; 75 Charlton et al., 1987; Davis et al., 2013; Fekadu et al., 1982). Further, the clinical period of rabies 76 coincides with the period of greatest infectivity, when excretion of virus in the saliva often 77 coincides with clinical signs such as aggression which promote transmission (Hanlon, 2013). 78 Testing for shifts in incubation and clinical period durations, and in the amount of virus excreted, 79 allows us to examine what constrains onward transmission of rabies in index hosts following cross-80 species transmission. 81 Based on previous work on rabies virus and in other host-pathogen systems, several mechanisms 82 can be hypothesised to influence infection dynamics and thus the outcome of crossexposed host species (host effects) influencing the outcome of cross-species 85 transmissions, irrespective of the infecting virus. For example, larger-bodied species may 86 be more resistant to infection and thus require either higher infectious doses or a longer 87 period of virus replication before symptoms become apparent. More generally, 88 evolutionarily conserved similarities in host physiology mean that groups of related taxa 89 might have similar susceptibility or clinical outcomes of infection (Longdon et al., 2011). 90 2.",

As a result, most bat species have lower body temperatures than most carnivore species, but 249 the distributions of body temperatures across bat and carnivore species still overlap (Supplementary 250 figure S 3B). The finding that incubation period duration is influenced by body temperature is 251 in vitro experiments showing that temperature can affect the infectivity of rabies 252 virus, possibly by altering the rate of cell-to-cell spread (Morimoto et al., 1996). However, the 253 specific mechanisms that could shorten incubation periods in a novel host environment which is 254 colder than the host environment to which the virus is adapted, remain to be identified. 255 Crucially, we found clear evidence for virus adaptation to host body temperature (Supplementary 256 figure S 2), consistent with infection progression being matched to each host species. Given this 257 host adaptation and relatively poor correspondence between body temperature differences and 258 phylogenetic distance, the observed temperature effect may help explain rabies virus host shifts 259 across large phylogenetic distances. For example, despite host shifts from bats into carnivores 260 being generally very rare, rabies virus has shifted repeatedly from big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus, 261 36 \u00b0C) to striped skunks, (Mephitis mephitis, 36.45 \u00b0C; Kuzmin et al., 2012; Tacutu et al., 2013). 262 More generally, our results suggest that transmissions to species with warmer typical body 263 temperatures than the current reservoir are more likely to become established, since this would be 264 expected to result in longer incubation periods and higher virus excretion. This might explain 265 observations suggesting sustained transmission of rabies virus lineages associated with common 266 vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus, 35 \u00b0C) in sympatric frugivorous bats (Artibeus lituratus; 37.3 267 \u00b0C; Kobayashi et al., 2007; Obreg\u00f3n-Morales et al., 2017; Tacutu et al., 2013). 268 The observation that low doses of viruses from bat reservoirs resulted in shorter incubation periods 269 relative to those from carnivores (Figure 2A & B) suggests increased infectivity and/or faster 270 within-host spread in bat-adapted rabies viruses. Since our data were limited to viruses from two 271 bat reservoirs -with 82% of these associated with one species, Tadarida brasiliensis (Figure 1) -272 it remains unclear whether this is a general feature of bat-associated rabies viruses. But, similar 273 results have been observed in humans, where both incubation and clinical periods were shorter 274 when the virus originated from bats rather than carnivores (Begeman et al., 2018). This bat-275 associated effect may be the result of body temperature differences -at 35 and 36 \u00b0C, the two bat 276 reservoirs included had cooler body temperatures than almost all inoculated species 277 (Supplementaryfigure 3). Alternatively, since bats are considerably smaller than known carnivore 278 reservoirs and likely transfer much smaller volumes of saliva during transmission, bat-associated 279 rabies viruses may be adapted to transmit at lower doses. Although it may be expected that smaller 280 animals require less virus to become infected and that body mass would modulate subsequent 281",

            "text": "the incubation period, the appearance of clinical signs of disease typically coincides 284 with viral excretion and transmission. The duration of clinical signs is therefore crucial in 285 determining whether an index host can transmit to conspecifics. Notably in the case of rabies virus, 286 the clinical period coincides with the onset of signs such as aggression that facilitate onward spread 287 through biting. It is also relatively short and invariably ends in death of the infected host, 288 terminating transmission opportunities(Hanlon, 2013). Since many animals in our dataset were 289 euthanised at some point after symptoms appeared (meaning the duration of their clinical period 290 was right-censored) it was difficult to estimate effect sizes for the clinical period with enough 291 precision to clearly distinguish them from zero (Figure 2A). However, there was some evidence 292 that increased phylogenetic distances between virus reservoirs and inoculated species reduced the 293 duration of clinical periods. Such increased virulence would mean that onward transmission 294 becomes increasingly unlikely following cross-species transmission between more distant 295 relatives. This is consistent with previous work showing that the number of successful rabies virus 296 host shifts among North American bats decreases with phylogenetic distance(Streicker et al.,  297   2010). This effect of phylogenetic distance on virulence and infectious period also provides further 298 evidence that rabies virus adapts to specific reservoir species by altering disease progression. 299Because rabies virus is generally transmitted via bite, the amount of virus excreted in the salivary 300 glands will affect the probability of transmission from the index case. Further, the overall strong 301 effects of dose we observed suggest that the amount of virus transferred to secondary cases will be 302aprimary determinant of disease progression in secondary cases and hence further transmission in 303 the new host population. Several authors have noted a positive correlation between the length of 304 rabies virus incubation periods and subsequent virus excretion levels (Baer and Bales, 1967; Davis 305 et al., 2013; Fekadu et al., 1982). Our results confirm this correlation across a wide range of host 306 species combinations, and show that it can be partially explained by inoculation doses, with higher 307 doses leading to both shorter incubation periods and decreased virus excretion. The remaining 308 correlation is explained by clustering of disease progression kinetics on the inoculated species 309 phylogeny, with related species having similar incubation periods and excreting similar amounts 310 of virus (Figure 3A-C). After removing these sources of correlation, non-reservoirs tended to have 311 lower virus titres in their salivary glands than established rabies virus reservoirs (Figure 3D & F)explain why the virus remains restricted to a relatively small number of reservoir hosts 313 despite frequent spillovers to other species (Mollentze et al., 2014). Our results also provide 314 tentative evidence of shorter incubation periods in non-reservoirs (Figure 2A). The exact 315 mechanisms underlying these differences between known rabies virus reservoirs and other species 316 remain unexplained, but are likely to be evolutionarily conserved, given the phylogenetic clustering 317 in excretion levels apparent in our analysis. 318 Many of our results point to adaptation of the rate of disease progression to match individual host 319 species. Studies of rabies virus host shifts have thus far failed to find sites in the virus genome 320 which consistently change during host adaptation (Kuzmin et al., 2012; Streicker et al., 2012; 321 Troupin et al., 2016). This has led to the suggestion that host adaptation can be achieved through 322 numerous sets of molecular changes (Streicker et al., 2012), which would indeed be the case if the 323 requirement is to balance disease progression to the point where onward transmission becomes 324 likely. In some host-pathogen systems, such adaptation is explained by a trade-off between 325 selection for faster growth to maximize viral load and thereby infectiousness, and selection for 326 reduced host damage (virulence) to maximize transmission opportunities (de Roode et al., 2008; 327 Fraser et al., 2007). In contrast, we observed a positive correlation between salivary gland titres 328 and incubation period duration, implying that slower host damage leads to greater infectiousness. 329 This, in turn, suggests a trade-off between faster replication and/or spread (speeding up disease 330 progression) and the ability to reach the salivary glands via functioning neural pathways. Such a 331 trade-off is supported by the observation that the correlation between incubation period duration 332 and salivary gland virus titre was modulated in part by dose (Figure 3C), with higher amounts of 333 virus reducing both. 334The experimental data analysed here offer a unique view on index infection dynamics following 335 cross-species transmission. By revealing the complex links between dose, physiological 336 differences between hosts, disease progression and virus excretion, our analyses bring us closer to 337 being able to model and predict the process of disease emergence and host shifts. The large dataset 338 of controlled infections further enabled us to generate disease progression parameter distributions 339 for all observed combinations of within and cross-species transmissions which can be directly 340 applied in future efforts to model rabies transmission dynamics (supplemental dataset S1). Of note 341 -many effects observed here were eventually overcome by high doses(Figure 2B-D &Figure 3F; 342 the median dose for experiments was 40,000 mouse LD50s), and future infection studies should 343",

Our results show that meta-analyses of cross-species infection 356 experiments provide a tractable means of investigating this process. Expanding such analyses to 357 other viruses may allow us to identify general rules which predict the outcome of cross-species 358transmissions. More work is needed to understand the host features that affect the probability of 359 infection upon exposure, the within-host mechanisms driving virulence, and the epidemiological 360 consequences of differences in disease progression and virus excretion. Our findings illustrate how 361 understanding these mechanisms will be key to predicting which cross-species exposures are most 362 likely to lead to future host shifts of rabies virus, and of zoonotic diseases more broadly. 363Methods 364Literature search and data collection 365 A search for published rabies virus infection studies was performed as described in supplementary 366 document S1. Searching across the PubMed and Web of Science databases yielded 2279 records 367 on 16 January 2015. These records were reviewed according to the criteria listed in table 1 to select 368 studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis. 369From each study, we recorded individual-level data on the species inoculated, the dose, inoculation 370 route, and the reservoir host species of the virus used. Response variables, when available, included 371 the observed incubation and clinical period durations, and the titre of virus present in the salivary 372 times (i.e. studies only reported ranges for groups of animals), and right-censored 374 observations (i.e. deaths unrelated to rabies before the conclusion of the study or euthanasia of 375 survivors at the end of each study). Because animals are generally euthanised once symptoms 376 appeared, the majority of data on the duration of clinical periods were right-censored, with exact 377 durations reported in only a small number of studies, generally performed before euthanasia 378 became common practice in animal experiments. 379Taxonomic classifications were updated to matchWilson and Reeder (2005), by matching the 380 scientific and common names given in each publication against the Integrated Taxonomic 381Information System database 1 . Data from our meta-analysis were supplemented with species-level 382 data from the PanTHERIA database, along with body-temperature data from the AnAge database 383(Jones et al., 2009; Tacutu et al., 2013). Because not all records were resolved to sub-species level, 384 and external data sources only contained data at the species level, information on the specific 385 subspecies involved was ignored in the analyses described here. This resulted in two pairs of 386 subspecies being clustered together, while two domesticated species were analysed using species-387 level data for their wild ancestor (Supplementary table S 1). Further data cleaning and validation 388 steps are described in supplementary document S1. 389 Accelerated failure time model 390 The durations of incubation and clinical periods were modelled using independent generalized 391 linear mixed models on the censored event times, in this context more frequently termed 392 accelerated failure time models. These models perform a regression on the waiting time to some 393 specific event (e.g. the appearance of clinical signs, signifying the end of the incubation period), 394 with coefficients acting to increase or decrease the time to the event. We assumed a log-normal 395 distribution for the event times . 396 Thus, the duration of the incubation period of each individual of species (the inoculated species), 397 inoculated with a virus from species (the source or reservoir species) log( ), while ),+,,,-and 1 are the mean and standard deviation of a normal 401 distribution, respectively. Coefficients are represented by ) , with ) 8 representing a vector of data 402 on potential explanatory variables. Finally, ( , ) and ( , , ) respectively represent 403 phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic random effects for the source species (the virus reservoir, 404 and ), inoculated species ( and ), and experiment ( ). 405 Phylogenetic random effects were drawn from a multivariate normal distribution taking the vector of zeros (of length or , equal to the number of source or inoculated species, 408 respectively), and M 5 and P 5 are variance parameters. M and P represent correlation matrixes 409 for all source and inoculated species, respectively. These matrixes were calculated from a 410 composite time-scaled phylogeny generated by timetree.org (Kumar et al., 2017) assuming a 411 Brownian model of trait evolution using version 3.5 of the APE package in R (Hadfield and 412 Nakagawa, 2010; Paradis et al., 2004). These random effects adjust for potential correlation in the 413 response variables due to relatedness. Similar results were obtained when using the mammalian 414 supertree of Bininda-Emonds et al. (2007), but this supertree had a slightly lower resolution than 415 the timetree.org phylogeny. 416 The non-phylogenetic random effects took the measure the variance between source and inoculated species not 419 captured by the Brownian model (Longdon et al., 2011), while V 5 measures the variance between 420 experiments. A similar model was used for the duration of clinical periods, except that data were 421 pooled across virus reservoirs by removing the random effects for reservoir species and reservoir 422 phylogeny ( and above). This was necessary because the clinical period data involved viruses 423 censoring, the vector of event times, , was treated as a latent variable. When 426 only the range of incubation or clinical period durations was given for a specific group of animals, 427 data was treated as interval censored, i.e. ),+,,,-\u2208 Y ),+,,,-, ),+,,,-\\, where and represent the 428 lower and upper boundaries of observed event times (supplementary document S1). When an 429 animal left the dataset without experiencing an event (e.g. when it was euthanised), the time of 430 censoring was recorded as a lower boundary, reflecting our knowledge that the event of interest 431 had not yet occurred by this point, but could have occurred at any time after this. In this case 432 ),+,,,-\u2208 Y ),+,,,-, \u221e2. 433 In this context, exact observations can be recorded simply by setting ),+,,,-= ),+,,,-. 434 Multi-response models 435 In an independent model, the amount of virus detected in salivary glands post mortem was modelled 436 jointly with incubation period durations, to allow estimation of the amount of residual correlation 437 between incubation period duration and the amount of virus in the salivary glands. Several authors 438 have noted a link between these measures (Baer and Bales, 1967; Davis et al., 2013; Fekadu et al., 439 1982), but it remains unexplained. 440This regression was similar to the model above, except that the normal distribution on 441 log(observations) was replaced with a multivariate normal distribution. Thus, in the full model, the 442 observed value of response variable for individual of species in experiment was 1 represents the incubation period (i.e. aef = log ( )) and = 2 is the virus titre in 446 the salivary glands. Virus titre was thus also modelled as log-normal, i.e. ae5 = log(1 + ), 447where represents the observed titres, which may be 0 if no virus was detected in the salivary 448 glands). a is a vector of coefficients unique to each response variable, while q a,, and o a,, are 449 random effects for inoculated species phylogeny and experiment, respectively. 450 residual variance in response variable 1 (incubation period durations), and 453 l,aef,ae5 is the residual covariance between incubation period durations and salivary gland titres. 454From this, the Pearson correlation between incubation periods and salivary gland titres can differences between the reservoir and the inoculated species were included to 459 assess the influence of previous virus adaptation on the outcome of infection in heterologous host 460 species. These included the phylogenetic distance between the reservoir and the inoculated species, 461 measured as patristic distances along the same composite time-scaled phylogeny generated by 462 timetree.org used above. As above, similar results were obtained when using the mammalian 463 supertree of Bininda-Emonds et al.(2007). We also included the difference in typical body 464 temperatures between the reservoir and inoculated species, as an example of a physiological 465 difference which does not appear to follow phylogenetic constraints (Clarke and Rothery, 2008), 466 because temperature is known to affect rabies virus infectivity in vitro(Morimoto et al., 1996). 467Finally, a binary variable distinguishing viruses derived from bat and carnivore reservoirs was 468 included, because differences in the clinical presentation of bat-and carnivore-associated rabies 469 virus infection in humans have been noted(Begeman et al., 2018). 470Features of the inoculated host species where accommodated primarily through random effects for 471 species and inoculated species phylogeny. However, we also included a measure of the typical 472 body mass of the inoculated species, since larger species may be proportionally more resistant to 473 the effects of a given dose of virus. Because only some species maintain rabies virus transmission 474 endemically, for reasons that are not well understood, a binary variable distinguishing known 475 reservoirs of rabies virus from other inoculated species was also included. 476",

Such proportional scaling means this variable is independent of 489 the differing body sizes of the inoculated species. Finally, because larger doses may compensate 490 for any decreases in infectivity caused by features of the inoculated species and/or physiological 491 differences between the inoculated species and the reservoir to which the virus was adapted, we 492 included interactions between dose and all host and virus effects above.493 Model fitting 494 Models were fit using version 2.25 of the MCMCglmm package in R version 3.5.1 (Hadfield, 2010; 495 R Core Team, 2018). All coefficients and the residual variance parameter received the default prior 496 distributions used by MCMCglmm, while parameter-expanded priors were used for the variance 497 parameters of all random effects (Gelman, 2006).
