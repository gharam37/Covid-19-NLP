A recent influx of 105 imported cases from Asia, Europe and North America into Singapore has triggered travel bans and 106 restrictions for travelers and citizens (9). 107 108 The reproduction number is a key threshold quantity to assess the transmission potential of an 109 emerging disease such as 27) . It quantifies the average number of secondary cases 110 generated per case. If the reproduction number is below 1.0, infections occur in isolated clusters 111 as self-limited chains of transmission, and persistence of the disease would require continued 112 undetected importations. On the other hand, reproduction numbers above 1.0 indicate sustained 113 community transmission (16, 27) . Using epidemiological data and mathematical modeling tools, 114 we are monitoring the effective reproduction number, Rt, of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 115 Singapore in real-time, and here we report the evolution of Rt by March 17, 2020. Specifically, we 116 characterize the growth profile and the effective reproduction number during the first transmission 117 wave from the daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset 118 after adjusting for reporting delays, and we also derive an estimate of the overall reproduction 119 number based on the characteristics of the clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore. .

Estimates of Rt>1 indicate 257 sustained transmission; whereas, Rt <1 implies that the outbreak is slowing down and the incidence 258 trend is declining. Hence, maintaining Rt <1 is required to bring an outbreak under control. Using 259 the reporting delay adjusted incidence curve, we estimate the most recent estimate of Rt for 260 COVID-19 in Singapore by characterizing the early transmission phase using a phenomenological 261 growth model as described in previous publications (40-42). Specifically, we first characterize 262 daily incidence of local cases for the first transmission wave (January 21-February 14, 2020) using 263 the generalized logistic growth model (GLM) after adjusting for imported cases. This model 264 characterizes the growth profile via three parameters: the growth rate (r), the scaling of the growth 265 parameter (p) and the final epidemic size (K). The GLM can reproduce a range of early growth 266 dynamics, including constant growth (p=0), sub-exponential or polynomial growth (0<p<1), and 267 exponential growth (p=1) (43).

Simultaneous inference of 285 heterogeneity and the reproduction number has been shown to improve the reliability of confidence 286 intervals for the reproduction number(50). In the branching process analysis, the number of 287 transmissions caused by each new infection is modeled as a negative binomial distribution. This 288 is parameterized by the effective reproduction number, R, and the dispersion parameter, k. The 289 reproduction number provides the average number of secondary cases per index case, and the 290 dispersion parameter varies inversely with the heterogeneity of the infectious disease. In this 291 parameterization, a lower dispersion parameter indicates higher transmission heterogeneity. 292 293 Branching process theory provides an analytic representation of the size distribution of cluster 294 sizes as a function of R, k and the number of primary infections in a cluster (as represented in 295 equation of 6 of the supplement of",

            "text": "first small wave of transmission comprising the first 25 epidemic days, the delay-adjusted 349 local incidence curve displays sub-exponential growth dynamics with the scaling of growth 350 parameter p at 0.7 (95% CI: 0.4, 1.0), the intrinsic growth rate r estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.3, 1.1) 351 and parameter K estimating the wave size estimated at 95 (95%CI: 56, 230). Because of the sub-352 exponential growth dynamics, the effective reproduction number followed a declining trend with 353 the latest estimate at 0.7 (95% CI: 0.3, 1.0) when = 0.15 (Figure 8). This estimate was not 354 sensitive to changes in parameter . 355 356 Based on the entire distribution of cluster sizes, we jointly estimated the overall reproduction 357 number R and the dispersion parameter k as of March 17, 2020. Fitting the negative binomial 358 distribution to the cluster data in the empirical distributions of the realizations during the early 359 stages of the outbreak in Singapore, the reproduction number is estimated at 0.61 (95% CI: 0.39, 360 1.02) after adjusting for the truncation of the time series leading to the possibility that some 361 infected cases might still cause new infections after March 17, 2020. The dispersion parameter occurred in Singapore while our most recent estimate of the effective reproduction number 368 is below the epidemic threshold of 1.0 whereas the overall reproduction number derived from the 369 distribution of cluster sizes just barely crosses 1.0 (Rt = 0.61 (95% CI: 0.39, 1.02). Temporary 370 sustained transmission in the beginning of the epidemic can be partly attributed to multiple case 371 importations and initiation of local transmission in the region. While large-scale local transmission 372 has not been reported in Singapore, the fact that asymptomatic and subclinical cases are now well 373 documented for COVID-19 (53) suggests that our estimates could be underestimated (54). On the 374 other hand, it is not clear if asymptomatic or subclinical cases are as infectious as symptomatic 375 cases. Indeed, we have reported that multiple local cases have yet to be traced to existing 376 transmission chains. Additional data collected during the course of the outbreak will help obtain 377 an improved picture of the transmission dynamics (55). These findings emphasize the need to 378 strengthen public health interventions including active case contact tracing activities in countries 379 with emerging transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (56). It is worth noting that imported cases have 380 minor contribution to secondary cases in Singapore, with most of the imported cases dating back 381 to the early phase of the epidemic and between March 10-17, 2020. However, there are examples 382 such as the Grant Hayatt Singapore cluster and the Yong Thai Hang cluster that were linked to 383imported sources, and the original sources had left Singapore before these local clusters estimates for Singapore are substantially lower than mean estimates reported for the 387 COVID-19 epidemic in other parts of the world (58-66). This indicates that containment efforts 388 have a significant impact in Singapore",

            "text": "study on the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea reported substantial potential for 399 superspreading transmission despite a subcritical Rt (69). The lower estimate of the dispersion 400 parameter in our study also indicate significant transmission heterogeneity in Singapore. Super-401 spreading events of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV associated with nosocomial outbreaks are well 402 documented and driven largely by substantial diagnostic delays (16, 37). Although the average 403 delay from onset of symptoms to diagnosis for COVID-19 patients in Singapore is at 6.4 days and 404 no super-spreading events has been observed yet, the dispersion parameter, k<1, indicates the 405 probability of observing large clusters and the potential for super-spreading such as the SAFRA 406 Jurong cluster (49, 69). Therefore, public health measures enacted by public health authorities in 407 Singapore that advise the public to avoid mass gatherings and confined places are crucial to prevent 408 disease amplification events. However, the presence of asymptomatic cases in the community 409 represent an ongoing threat (70, 71) although it is not currently known if subclinical cases are less 410 infectious. This highlights the need for rapid testing of suspected cases to quickly isolate those that 411 test positive for the novel coronavirus. To achieve this goal, public health authorities in Singapore 412 are reactivating 900 general practitioner clinics (72). While new clusters emerge in Singapore, 413 some clusters including the Yong Thai Hang cluster, Seletar Aerospace cluster, Wizlearn 414 Technologies and the Grand Hayatt cluster have stabilized (no recent additional cases in most 415 clusters). The \"Grace Assembly of God and the Life Church and Missions\" cluster and the 416 \"SAFRA Jurong\" cluster continue to be consolidated (57, 73). 417 418 Beyond Singapore, COVID-19 cases are now being reported in 204 countries including 419",

The cluster started during The Life Church and Missions service event in Paya Lebar 162 on January 19, 2020. This event was apparently seeded by two visitors from Wuhan China who 163 infected a couple with SARS-CoV-2 at the church. The infected couple likely passed the infection 164 to another case during a Lunar New Year's celebration on January 25, 2020. This case had 165 subsequently infected Grace Assembly of God church staff at the Tanglin branch, generating 166 secondary cases by the time he was reported on February 14, 2020. Two branches of the Grace 167 Assembly of God church at Tanglin and Bukit Batok have been included in this cluster (28, 31). 168 This church serves an average of 4800 people in attendance over the weekend. While the church 169 has momentarily closed, field investigations have not led to conclusive evidence regarding super-170 spreading transmission (32).
