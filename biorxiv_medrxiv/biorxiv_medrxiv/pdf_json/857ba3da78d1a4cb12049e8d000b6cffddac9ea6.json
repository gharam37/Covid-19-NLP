Based on structures of antibodies targeting HCV envelope glycoprotein E2, we designed immunogens to modulate the structure and dynamics of E2 and favor induction of bNAbs in the context of a vaccine. These designs include a point mutation in a key conserved antigenic site to stabilize its conformation, as well as redesigns of an immunogenic region to add a new N-glycosylation site and mask it from antibody binding.",

Designs were tested in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating alteration of the E2 antigenic profile in several cases, and one design led to improvement of cross-neutralization of heterologous viruses.

Chronic HCV infection can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, the leading cause of liver cancer, and in the United States HCV was found to surpass HIV and 59 other infectious conditions as a cause of death (2) . While the development of directacting antivirals has improved treatment options considerably, several factors impede the effective use of antiviral treatment such as the high cost of antivirals, viral resistance, occurrence of reinfections after treatment cessation, and lack of awareness of infection in many individuals since HCV infection is considered a silent epidemic. Therefore, development of an effective preventative vaccine for HCV is necessary to reduce the burden of infection and transmission, and for global elimination of HCV (3) .",

This was also clearly demonstrated during clinical trials of a monoclonal antibody, HCV1, which in spite of its targeting a conserved epitope on the viral envelope, failed to eliminate the virus, as viral variants with epitope mutations emerged under immune pressure and dominated the rebounding viral populations in all treated individuals (10, 11) .",

The HC84.26.WH.5DL is an affinity matured clone of the parental HC84.26 antibody with improved affinity and neutralization breadth over the parental antibody (31). The binding site of CD81 has been mapped to E2 residues in antigenic domains B, D, and E (35), thus CD81 binding provides additional assessment of antigenicity of that E2 supersite (6) . Binding experiments with this panel showed nanomolar binding affinities to wildtype sE2, which were largely maintained for sE2 designs. A 10-fold increase in binding affinity of sE2 design H445P for domain D HMAb HC84.26.WH.5DL was observed, showing that this design, located within antigenic domain D, not only maintained affinity, but improved engagement in that case; a steady-state binding fit for that interaction is shown in Figure 3A . However, this effect was not observed for combinations of designs including H445P, suggesting possible interplay between designed sites. As expected, domain A hyperglycosylation designs Y632NS, \u0394HVR1-Y632NS, and Triple (\u0394HVR1-H445P-Y632NS) showed loss of binding (>5-fold for each) to antigenic domain A HMAb CBH-4G (Y632NS-CBH-4G binding measurement is shown in Figure 3B ), though we did not observe disruption of binding to CBH-4D. Additionally, design \u0394HVR1-Y632NS showed moderate (6-fold) loss of CD81 binding, which was not the case for other designs. As domain A HMAbs have distinct, albeit similar, binding determinants on E2 (28), differential effects on domain A antibody binding by Y632NS variants reflect likely differences in HMAb docking footprints on E2. Measurements of glycan occupancy at residue 632 using mass spectroscopy showed partial levels of glycosylation at that site for Y632NS and combinations (Table 4) , which may be responsible for incomplete binding ablation to the tested antigenic domain A HMAbs. As alanine substitution at Y632 was previously found to disrupt binding of domain A antibodies (28), it is possible that the Y632N amino acid substitution in the Y632NS author/funder.

Sera were obtained at Day 56 (two weeks after the final boost) and tested for binding to H77C sE2 and key conserved epitopes (AS412/Domain E, AS434/Domain D) ( Figure   4 ).

In this study, we tested the E2 \u0394HVR1 mutant with residues 384-407 removed, which retains residues 408-661 of E2; this is a more conservative truncation than previously tested \u0394HVR1 mutants, in order to retain residue 408 which is binding determinant for the HC33.4 HMAb and others (28, 34).

Although HVR1 is an immunogenic epitope, its removal from recombinant E2 glycoprotein does not appear to increase homologous or heterologous nAb titers, with the latter suggesting that the level of antibodies targeting conserved nAb epitopes did not increase upon HVR1 removal.

Interestingly, a residue adjacent to the site of this design appears to be functionally important, with the Q444R substitution restoring viral infectivity in the context of an HCVpp with a domain E \"glycan shift\" substitution, N417S (8) . The design strategy of utilizing proline residue substitutions to stabilize conformations of viral glycoproteins has been successful for HIV Env (47), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F (48), MERS coronavirus spike (49) , and recently, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spike (50) .

Through the efforts of isolating bNAbs to distinct regions on E2 from multiple HCV infected individuals, non-neutralizing antibodies to domain A are consistently identified (personal communication, S. Foung). This strategy has been successfully employed for other glycoprotein immunogens, including for HIV Env SOSIP trimers, where the immunogenic V3 loop was masked with designed N-glycans (30). Surprisingly, some of the designs in this study exhibited an impact on recognition by antibodies targeting antigenic domain D on the front layer of E2, suggesting a possible interplay between the front and back layers of E2, as proposed previously based on global alanine scanning mutagenesis (35). As observed by Ringe et al. in the context of HIV Env (30), the designed E2 N-glycan variant tested for immunogencity in this study (Y632NS) did not show improvements in nAb elicitation.",

For recombinant HCV E1E2 expression, the H77C E1E2 glycoprotein coding region (GenBank accession number AF011751) was synthesized with a modified tPA signal peptide (57) at the N-terminus and cloned into the vector pcDNA3.1+ at the cloning sites of KpnI/NotI (GenScript). Expi293 cells (Thermo Fisher) were used to express the E1E2 glycoprotein complex. In brief, the Expi293 cells were grown in Expi293 medium (ThermoFisher) at 37\u00b0C, 125 rpm, 8% CO2 and 80% humidity in Erlenmeyer sterile polycarbonate flasks (VWR). The day before the transfection, 2.0 \u00d7 10 6 viable cells/ml was seeded in a flask and the manufacturer's protocol (A14524, ThermoFisher) was followed for transfection performance. After 72 hours post-transfection, the cell pellets were harvested by centrifuging cells at 3,000 x g for 5 min and the cell pellet were then stored at -80 \u00b0C for further processing. Recombinant E1E2 was extracted from cell membranes using 1% NP-9 and purified via sequential Fractogel EMD TMAE (Millipore), Fractogel EMD SO3 -(Millipore).HC84.26 immunoaffinity, and Galanthus Nivalis Lectin (GNL, Vector Laboratories) affinity chromatography.

CD81-LEL was expressed through transiently transfection in Expi293F cells (ThermoFisher) and purified from supernatant with a Gravity Flow Strep-Tactin Superflow high capacity column (IBA Lifesciences).
