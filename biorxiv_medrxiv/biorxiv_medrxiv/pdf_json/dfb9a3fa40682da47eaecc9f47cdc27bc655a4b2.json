Oxygenation of 2.5-5 L of blood/minute is realistic. Benefit/risk analysis appears favorable if a patient requires respiratory support but cannot be supported because of lack of ventilators or unavailability of a required ECMO system. Conclusion: Ad-hoc assembly of veno-venous ECMOs using Impella pumps is feasible and results in stable blood flow across gas exchange modules. However, such off-label use of the devices calls for specific ethical and regulatory considerations prior to their use as last resort in patients for whom no other treatment modalities are available.",

Figure 1 shows the concept, the used parts, assembly process and the results of such lean ad-hoc ECMO systems. Prototype systems were built as a first simplified closed loop with an embedded Impella CP pump only, as a second closed loop setup incorporating a venous suction cannula, a venous return cannula, an oxygenator and in-line Impella pump driven by a standard Impella AIC console (Abiomed, Danvers MA, U.S.A), and a third system additionally containing a second gas exchange module flushed with nitrogen to simulate oxygen extraction in patients. Abiomed Impella CP and Impella 5.0 pumps, and a standard ECMO oxygenator (Hilite 7000, Stolberg, Germany) were used. Key steps are the coaxial introduction of the Impella pump into the tube through a Y tube connector, prevention of recirculation of the pumped blood around the Impella pump head by suited obstruction/constriction of the outer tube, suited tube diameter stepups/stepdowns to minimize flow resistance at pump inlet/outlet and the use of large enough venous drainage cannulas (17-29F; 24-31F dual lumen cannulas) and sufficiently large (17-22F) jugular venous return cannulas.

Flows and pressures were determined using the sensors built into the Impella catheters/consoles and using external pressure sensors. Oxygenators were tested visually for clots formation and pressure gradients were determined over time. In the setup using two sequential gas exchange modules (the first flushed with N2 for partial deoxygenation) and the second with O2 for oxygenation, gas exchange over time was followed by blood gas analysis. Figure 2a shows predicted, pressure-gradient dependent pump performance of the Impella pumps used, based on available Impella performance charts and shows observed system flow performance in our CP-based systems. Figure 2b shows expected pressure drops across typical cannulas according to publicly available data 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 and gives the measured pressure drops across the used oxygenator type when driven at various flows using standard ECMO consoles in patients with a hematocrit of approximately 30%, based on own historical observations.

Flows were at least as high as predicted by combining pump performance and component pressure drop charts. The combination of pump performance chart, cannula pressure drop chart and experimental observations indicates that when using large enough cannuals, the \"sweet spot\" for Impella CP based systems is between 2.8 and 3.5 L/min, while for Impella 5.0, it is between 3.5 and 4.5 L/min.",

A patient benefit is improbable if the probability of outcome is anyway very good or very bad, or if standard ventilators and conventional ECMO devices are available that should be used preferentially.

D,E: pieces and assembly of Impella 5.0-based ad-hoc ECMO system. F: closed-loop setup for pump testing, was run for 48 hours and showed stable performance. G: venous access cannulas; the 25F and 22F cannula were used in F. F: closed loop system including Impella pump, venous drainage and return cannulas, oxigenator module; to simulate oxygen extraction by a patient, an additional gas exchange module (flused with N2) is added. 48 hourtesting of this setup with reconstituted blood showed stable flows, and stable gas exchange.

Dotted black line/Oxi: observed pressure drops across gas exchange module Hilite 7000LT in patients with ECMO. Dashed lines: estimated pressure drops in venous drainage cannulas(55-65 cm length). Red: Maquet 29F; violet: Edwards QuickDraw 25F, Medtronic Biomedicus 25F; Green: Maquet Avalon 31 F bicaval (drainage lumen); orange: Medos Novaport dual lumen Twin24F (drainage lumen). Solid lines, underlined labels: estimated pressure drops in venous return cannulas (15-23cm length). Blue: Maquet 19F. green: Edwards 22F Red: Maquet/Getinge 23F cannula, yellow: 17F cannula.",
