The titers of NAbs in all patients were low 203 (ID50: < 200) before day 10 post-disease onset and then increased at day 10 to 15 post-204 disease onset, remaining stable thereafter (Figure 2A).

            "text": "the COVID-19 global pandemic highlights the urgent need to develop 276 effective treatments or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection. NAbs have been 277 considered as an effective drug to treat or prevent virus infection. Here we evaluated 278 the level of NAbs in recovered patients of COVID-19 by using a PsVs neutralization 279 assay, which has been extensively used for the evaluation of NAbs for many highly 280 pathogenic viruses, including Ebola, 13 highly pathogenic influenza virus, 14,15 SARS-281 CoV, 16 and MERS-CoV. 17 The PsVs neutralization assay was also used for the 282 evaluation of NAbs for SARS-CoV-2 in some recent reports, 11,18,19 generating 283 consistent results compared with traditional plaque reduction neutralization assay. 18 284 We found that most COVID-19 patients developed SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs at the 285 convalescent phase of infection. The titers of NAbs reached their peak at 10 to 15 days 286 after disease onset and remained stable thereafter in patients. Antibodies targeting on 287 different domains of S protein, including S1, RBD and S2, may all contribute to the 288 neutralization. 289 Conserved epitopes may exist between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV since they share 290 77.2% identical amino acids in their spike proteins. 2 Few reports have demonstrated 291 that SARS-CoV-specific monoclonal NAbs could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 PsV 292 infection, 3,11,18 Even though plasma from COVID-19 patients showed cross-binding to 293 SARS-Cov, they did not neutralize SARS-CoV, indicating that the antigenicity of 294 SARS-CoV-2 is different from that of SARS-CoV. Evidence deduced from this study 295 only suggested that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeted the conserved epitopes of 296 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 may not be easily elicited during the infection of 297 COVID-19, making this a potential line of advanced study.",

The elderly patients in this cohort also had higher blood CRP 314 level and lower lymphocyte counts at the time of admission, indicating the induction of 315 stronger innate immune response than younger patients. High level of NAbs may be a 316 result of strong immune response in these elderly patients. Whether the high level of 317 NAbs protect these patients from progression into severe and critical conditions is 318 worthy of comprehensive evaluation. Further study of the immunological 319 characteristics of COVID-19 patients may reveal key determinants in the generation of 320 NAbs and effective cell-mediated immune responses, which is important for the 321 development of an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus. 322 This study is preliminary and has several limitations. First, viral RNA was not 323 detectable in patients' blood. Owing to the lack of respiratory specimens, information 324 about the kinetics of viral loads was not available. Second, patients in severe and critical 325 condition were excluded from the study because they received passive antibody 326 treatment before sample collection. Thus, we were not able to directly evaluate the 327 effect of NAbs on virus clearance or disease progression of COVID-19 patients in this 328 study. A further comprehensive study should be made to address the question. 329 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about NAbs drawn from the plasma 330 of a COVID-19 recovered patient cohort, potentially providing useful information for 331 passive antibody therapy and vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 virus. The 332 highly variable levels of NAbs in the patients of COVID-19 indicated that convalescent 333 plasma and serum from recovered donors should be titrated before use in passive 334",
