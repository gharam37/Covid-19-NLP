            "text": "We leveraged the largely untapped resource of electronic health record data to address critical clinical and epidemiological questions about Coronavirus Disease 2019 . To do this, we formed an international consortium (4CE) of 96 hospitals across 5 countries (www.covidclinical.net). Contributors utilized the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) or Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) platforms to map to a common data model. The group focused on comorbidities and temporal changes in key laboratory test values. Harmonized data were analyzed locally and converted to a shared aggregate form for rapid analysis and visualization of regional differences and global commonalities. Data covered 27,584 COVID-19 cases with 187,802 laboratory tests. Case counts and laboratory trajectories were concordant with existing literature. Laboratory tests at the time of diagnosis showed hospital-level differences equivalent to country-level variation across the consortium partners. Despite the limitations of decentralized data generation, we established a framework to capture the trajectory of COVID-19 disease in patients and their response to interventions.",

The virulence and transmissibility of responsible virus (SARS-CoV-2) is striking. Crucially, there remains a paucity of relevant clinical information to drive response at the clinical and population levels. Even in an information technology-dominated era, fundamental measurements to guide public health decision-making remain unclear. Knowledge still lags on incidence, prevalence, case-fatality rates, and clinical predictors of disease severity and outcomes. While some of the knowledge gaps relate to the need for further laboratory testing, data that should be widely available in electronic health records have not yet been effectively shared across clinical sites, with public health agencies, or with policy makers. At the time of this writing, more than three months after the earliest reports of the disease in China, only 5.8% of US cases reported to the CDC have clinical details included. 1 Even before therapeutic trials are implemented, frontline clinicians are not yet benefitting from knowledge as basic as understanding the differences in the clinical course between male and female patients. 2 Through case studies and series, we have learned that COVID-19 can have multi-organ involvement. A growing literature has identified key markers of cardiac, 3 immune, 4 coagulation, 5 muscle, 5,6 hepatic, 7 and renal 8 injury and dysfunction, including extensive evidence of myocarditis and cardiac injury associated with severe disease. Laboratory perturbations in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin 9 have been described. However, data from larger cohorts, linked to outcomes, remain unavailable.",

Most 4CE sites with i2b2 used database scripts to directly query their i2b2 repository to calculate counts needed for data files. Institutions without i2b2 used their own clinical data warehouse solutions and querying tools to create the files. In some cases, a hybrid method was used that leveraged different data warehouse platforms to fill in i2b2 gaps.

Age distribution was different across countries and consistent with previously identified patterns.

Drop off in tests performed could be a result of death, length of stay, or change in frequency of data collection by the clinical team. From the maximum number of laboratory tests consistently checked on the first day after diagnosis, there was a rapid tapering in frequency of laboratory tests checked. These changes were particularly pronounced in Italy and France. We identified the number of days until the number of tests checked were 20% of their initial maximum value. Values for laboratory study for each day are presented on https://covidclinical.net. Results varied for each laboratory value and site. There was no obvious country level pattern. Given that several of these tests, such as creatinine, were commonly checked nearly every day in ill patients, the implication was that patients were censored from the laboratory results because of discharge or death or changing practice pattern. Thus, for the purposes of this paper, we focused on trends in creatinine. We normalized the number of tests performed by day to the total performed on day 1. We then looked at the day when the number of tests performed was 20% of the maximum number performed for each site. For creatinine, for example, a drop-off in testing occurred between day 7 and 15 across institutions. Most patients who survived were likely discharged within this time frame or managed with much less monitoring. Further results can be found online.",

Limitations also include heavy right censoring where patient absence can be due to death or discharge, variations in ICD annotations for conditions existing prior to the COVID-19-related admission, delays in updating billing codes or in uploading EHR data to the local analytic data repository. Furthermore, potentially confounding interactions between comorbidities, chronic diseases and their treatments and lifestyle or exposures were not taken into consideration. Again, because of these limitations we were careful to avoid making more than basic and descriptive conclusions. Over the coming weeks, we will work to quantify these biases and adjust for them, if we can. This will include adding data types as well as disaggregating the data to the patient level if and when permitted by IRBs.
