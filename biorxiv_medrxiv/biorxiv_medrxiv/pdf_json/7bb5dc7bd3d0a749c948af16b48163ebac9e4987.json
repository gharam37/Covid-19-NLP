            "text": "Isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests (iNAT), such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), are good alternatives to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplification assays, especially for point-of-care and low resource use, in part because they can be carried out with relatively simple instrumentation. However, iNATs can generate spurious amplicons, especially in the absence of target sequences, resulting in false positive results. This is especially true if signals are based on non-sequence-specific probes, such as intercalating dyes or pH changes. In addition, pathogens often prove to be moving, evolving targets, and can accumulate mutations that will lead to inefficient primer binding and thus false negative results. Internally redundant assays targeting different regions of the target sequence can help to reduce such false negatives. Here we describe rapid conversion of three previously described SARS-CoV-2 LAMP assays that relied on non-sequence-specific readout into assays that can be visually read using sequencespecific fluorogenic oligonucleotide strand exchange (OSD) probes. We evaluate one-pot operation of both individual and multiplex LAMP-OSD assays and demonstrate detection of SARS-CoV-2 virions in crude human saliva. : bioRxiv preprint",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) uses the strand-displacing Bst DNA polymerase and 4 primers (FIP, BIP, F3, and B3) that bind to 6 target regions (B3, B2, B1, F1c, F2c and F3c) to generate 10 9 to 10 10 copies of DNA or RNA targets, typically within 1 to 2 h (Figure 1 ). 1 In greater detail, F2 in FIP (F1c-F2) and B2 in BIP (B1c-B2) initiate amplification. F1c and B1c self-prime subsequent amplification. F3 and B3-initiated DNA synthesis displaces FIP and BIP-initiated strands. 3\u2032-ends of the resulting single-stranded, dumbbell-shaped amplicons are extended to hairpins by Bst polymerase. FIP and BIP hybridize to the single-stranded loops and initiate DNA synthesis that opens the hairpin to form concatameric amplicons containing self-priming 3\u2032-end hairpins. The ensuing continuous amplification generates double-stranded concatameric amplicons with self-priming hairpins and single-stranded loops. 1 LAMP can rival PCR for sensitivity without thermocycling, 2 and additional stem and loop primers can accelerate amplification, with some LAMP assays being complete within 10 min. 3, 4 However, since LAMP is commonly read using non-specific methods (such as, Mg 2+ precipitation, intercalating dyes or labeled primers) that cannot distinguish spurious amplicons that frequently arise from continuous amplification, its utility can be limited. We have previously overcome these drawbacks using oligonucleotide strand exchange (OSD) probes, based in part on advances in strand exchange DNA computation (Figure 1) . Strand exchange occurs when two partially or fully complementary strands hybridize to each other by displacing pre-hybridized strand(s) ( Figure  1B) . Strand exchange usually initiates by basepairing at single-stranded 'toeholds' and progresses to form additional basepairs via branch migration, allowing the rational design of complex algorithms and programmable nanostructures [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . The hemiduplex oligonucleotide probes contain a so-called 'toehold' that allows sequence-specific interaction with a target molecule, and have opposed fluor and quencher moieties. In the presence of a complementary target, the OSD probes can undergo strand exchange and separation, leading to an easily read fluorescent signal. 10 In essence the OSD probes are functional equivalents of TaqMan probes and have been shown to accurately report single or multiplex LAMP amplicons from few tens of targets without interference from non-specific amplicons or inhibitors. 10, 11 Of equal import, the programmability of OSD probes allows their adaptation to many different assay formats, including to off-the-shelf devices such as glucometers and pregnancy test strips. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Figure 1. LAMP-OSD schematic. 'c' denotes complementary sequences. F and Q on the OSD denote fluorophore and quencher, respectively. OSD and subsequent strand exchange intermediates are denoted by numbered domains, which represent short (usually <12 nt) sequences in an otherwise continuous oligonucleotide.

We have shown that higher order molecular information processing is also possible, such as integration of signals from multiple amplicons 17 . Overall, the use of sequence-specific probes allow construction of strand exchange computation circuits that act as 'matter computers', 5-8 something that is not generally possible within the context of a PCR reaction (which would of necessity melt the computational devices). disruption to standard assay practice. To that end, here we demonstrate the conversion of three recently pre-published LAMP primer sets described for detection of SARS-CoV-2, but that used non-specific readout methods ( Table 1) . The LAMP-OSD versions of these assays maintain the simplicity of visual yes/no readout, while endowing the assays with the inherent accuracy of probe-based signal transduction.

The three primer sets target different regions in the ORF1AB and N genes of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Fluorogenic OSD probes were designed for each of these primer sets using previously described principles and the Nucleic acid circuit design software NUPACK available freely at http://www.nupack.org/. 10, 19 Briefly, the target derived loop regions between the F1c and F2 primer binding sites were chosen as OSD binding regions for each of the three LAMP primer sets. The long OSD strand was designed to be complementary to this loop region. Single stranded 11-12 nucleotides long toehold regions were designated on one end of this long strand while a complementary short OSD strand was designed to hybridize to the remaining portion of the long strand. The long strand was labeled with a fluorescein moiety at the terminus not acting as the toehold. The short strand was labeled with a quencher and all free 3'-OH ends were blocked with inverted dT to prevent extension by DNA polymerase. Amplicon accumulation was measured by adding OSD probes. First, Tholoth, Lamb, and NB OSD probes were prepared by annealing 1 \u00b5M of the fluorophore-labeled OSD strand with 2 \u00b5M, 3 \u00b5M, and 5 \u00b5M, respectively of the quencher-labeled strand in 1X Isothermal buffer. Annealing was performed by denaturing the oligonucleotide mix at 95 \u00b0C for 1 min followed by slow cooling at the rate of 0.1 \u00b0C/s to 25 \u00b0C. Excess annealed probes were stored at -20 \u00b0C. Annealed Tholoth, Lamb, and NB OSD probes were added to their respective LAMP reactions at a final concentration of 100 nM, 100 nM, and 20 nM, respectively of the fluorophore-bearing strand. Multiplex LAMP-OSD assays comprising both Tholoth and NB primers and probes were set up using the same conditions as above except, the total LAMP primer amounts were made up of equimolar amounts of Tholoth and NB primers.",

Overnight 3 ml cultures of these transformed bacteria were grown in 2X YT broth containing 100 \u00b5g/mL ampicillin. Subsequently, sub-cultures were initiated at 1:200 dilution using 50 mL Superior Broth TM (Athena Environmental Sciences, Inc., Baltimore, MD, USA) containing 100 \u00b5g/ml ampicillin. These cultures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C and constant 225 rpm agitation till they reached the log phase of growth (A600 = 0.4 to 0.7). Protein production was initiated by adding 20ng/ml anhydrotetracycline (aTC) followed by 3 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C with 225 rpm agitation.

We found that 9 of the 11 sets showed significant no-template amplification in over 10% of the replicates in less than an hour of incubation at 65 \u00b0C (data not shown). These results are consistent with other published results that rely on colorimetric LAMP reactions, rather than on probe-based detection. 21 In fact, for many published assays, color changes must be read within a narrow window of time in order to minimize spurious conclusions, a consideration that does not scale well for diagnostic screening, especially at point-of-care or as an early part of a clinical diagnostics pipeline. To suppress potential false positive readout, we chose to develop OSD probes for three of the LAMP primer sets, termed herein as NB, Lamb, and Tholoth ( Table 1) . These primer sets target three different regions of the viral genome, the N gene, the NSP3 coding region of ORF1AB, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase coding region of ORF1AB. Of the three primer sets, the NB assay had the lowest propensity for spurious signal when analyzed by non-specific colorimetric readout (data not shown). To create LAMP-OSD versions of these assays, we designed OSD probes that were complementary to one of the loop sequences in each of the three LAMP amplicons. Subsequently, Tholoth, Lamb, and NB LAMP-OSD assays were setup individually by mixing separate reaction components as indicated in the Methods section. Each individual assay contained its specific OSD probes along with both inner primers FIP and BIP and both outer primers F3 and B3. In addition, each assay also received the backward loop (LB) primer that bound to the amplicon loop between B1c and B2 sites that was not recognized by the respective OSD probe. The forward loop (LF) primer that overlapped the Tholoth and NB OSD binding region was excluded. The LF primer was also initially excluded in Lamb LAMP-OSD assay even though the amplicon loop that bound this loop primer was long enough to accommodate a nonoverlapping OSD reporter; this was done to fairly compare the amplification kinetics of all three assays in a 5-primer format. In later versions of the assay with the Lamb primers, all 6 primers were included (designated as \"6 primer Lamb\" in Figures 3, 6, and 7) . Figure 2 , in response to target templates, all three LAMP-OSD assays generated strong OSD signal that could be measured both in real-time and observed visually at endpoint without interference from noise. We then tested the three LAMP-OSD assays using SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA as templates.",

We chose to multiplex the NB and the Tholoth assays because they target different viral genes: the N gene and the ORF1AB gene, respectively. We first tested the ability of both primer sets to amplify their respective synthetic targets (in vitro RNA transcripts of N gene and ORF1AB gBlock DNA templates) in a multiplex assay format by assembling LAMP-OSD reactions containing equimolar amounts of both Tholoth and NB LAMP primer sets with either only one or both OSD probes.",

Moreover, these samples are relatively difficult to self-collect. In contrast, saliva can be non-invasively collected simply by spitting in a sterile collection vessel and it can be done just as easily in a clinic as well as at home. Moreover, studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can be consistently detected in patient saliva with median viral loads of 3.3 \u00d7 10 6 copies/mL. 25 We tested the direct sample analysis ability of individual and multiplex LAMP-OSD assays by seeding them with 3 \u00b5L of human saliva spiked with SARS-CoV-2 virions. As control, duplicate LAMP-OSD reactions were seeded with virions suspended in 3 \u00b5L of TE buffer.

We suggest that while LAMP-OSD may not have the same sensitivity as 'gold standard' RT-qPCR assays, that the versatility of LAMP-OSD, especially for resource poor settings with limited infrastructure, might prove useful for screening for positives, which could then be followed up with more limited or difficult to execute RT-qPCR tests.",
