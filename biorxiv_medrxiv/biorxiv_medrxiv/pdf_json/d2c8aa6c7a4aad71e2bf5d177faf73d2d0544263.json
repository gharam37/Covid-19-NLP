            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a pandemic and continues to spread around the globe at an unprecedented rate. To date, no effective therapeutic is available to fight its associated disease, COVID-19. Our discovery of a novel insertion of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding motif at S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site (681-686 (PRRARS)) and two other GAG-binding-like motifs within SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (SGP) led us to hypothesize that host cell surface GAGs might be involved in host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Using a surface plasmon resonance direct binding assay, we found that both monomeric and trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike more tightly bind to immobilized heparin (KD = 40 pM and 73 pM, respectively) than the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV SGPs (500 nM and 1 nM, respectively). In competitive binding studies, the IC50 of heparin, tri-sulfated non-anticoagulant heparan sulfate, and non-anticoagulant low molecular weight heparin against SARS-CoV-2 SGP binding to immobilized heparin were 0.056 \u03bcM, 0.12 \u03bcM, and 26.4 \u03bcM, respectively. Finally, unbiased computational ligand docking indicates that heparan sulfate interacts with the GAGbinding motif at the S1/S2 site on each monomer interface in the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP, and at another site (453-459 (YRLFRKS)) when the receptor-binding domain is in an open conformation. Our study augments our knowledge in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and advances carbohydrate-based COVID-19 therapeutic development. author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic Betacoronavirus transmitted through person-person contact through airborne and fecal-oral routes, and has caused over 693,000 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and 33,000 associated deaths worldwide [2] [3] [4] [5] . While there is limited understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, extensive studies have been performed on how its closely related cousins, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus), invade host cell. Upon initially contacting the surface of a host cell, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV exploit host cell proteases to prime their surface spike glycoproteins (SGPs) for fusion activation, which is achieved by receptor binding, low pH, or both [6, 7] . The receptor binding domain (RBD) resides within subunit 1 (S1) while subunit 2 (S2) facilitates viral-host cell membrane fusion [6] . Activated SGP undergoes a conformational change followed by an initiated fusion reaction with the host cell membrane [6] . Endocytosed virions are further processed by the endosomal protease cathepsin L in the late endosome [7, 8] . Both MERS-Cov and SARS-CoV require proteolytic cleavage at their S2' site, but not at their S1-S2 junction, for successful membrane fusion and host cell entry [6, 7] . Additionally, receptors involved in fusion activation of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV include heparan sulfate (HS) and angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), respectively [9] [10] [11] .",

For example, an FDA approved anticoagulant heparin (HP) is a secretory GAG released from granules of mast cells during infection [15, 16] . Some GAG binding proteins can be identified by amino acid sequences known as Cardin-Weintraub motifs corresponding to 'XBBXBX' and 'XBBBXXBX', where X is a hydropathic residue and B is a basic residue, such as arginine and lysine, responsible for interacting with the sulfate groups present in GAGs [17, 18] . Examination of the SARS-CoV-2 SGP sequence revealed that the GAG-binding motif resides within S1-S2 proteolytic cleavage motif (furin cleavage motif BBXBB) that is not present in SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV SGPs (Fig 1, S2 Fig, S3 Fig) [19] .

Sensorgrams of CoV SGP-HP interactions are shown in Fig 2. The sensorgrams were fit globally to obtain association rate constant (ka), dissociation rate constant (kd) and equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) ( Table 1) using the BiaEvaluation software and assuming a 1:1 Langmuir model. SARS-CoV-2 and MERS CoV SGP exhibited a markedly low dissociation rate constant (kd ~ 10 -7 1/s) suggesting excellent binding strength. The HP binding properties of monomeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP was comparable to that of the trimeric form (KD of monomer and trimer were 40 pM and 73 pM, respectively).

One reason for SARS-CoV-2 SGP monomer and trimer extremely high affinity to immobilized heparin is the high density of surface bound ligands might promote polyvalent interactions. The difference of binding kinetics and affinity of CoV SGPs to HP may also be due in part to the difference in protein sequence of the Cov SGPs.

The SGP contains three putative GAG-binding motifs with the following sequences: 453-459 (YRLFRKS), 681-686 (PRRARS), and 810-816 (SKPSKRS), which we define as sites 1, 2, and 3, respectively (Fig 1, S2 Fig, S3 Fig) . An HS hexasaccharide fragment (GlcA(2S)-GlcNS(6S)) binds site 2 in each monomer chain in the trimeric SGP ( Fig 5C, S3 Fig) . The docking results also indicates that HS may bind to site 1 when the apex of the S1 monomer is in an open conformation, as this allows basic residues to be more accessible to ligand binding. The site 1 residues are less accessible for GAG binding when the domain is in a closed conformation (Fig 5D) . The electrostatic potential surface representation of the trimeric SGP confirms that the GAG-binding poses generally prefer regions of positive charge, as expected, and illustrates that basic residues within site 3 are not exposed for binding to HS on any of the chains (Fig 5A) . Finally, our blind docking analysis reveals that a longer HS polymer may span an inter-domain channel that contains site 2.",

SPR studies demonstrate that both monomeric and trimeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP bind HP with remarkably high affinity and it prefers long, heavily sulfated (TriS rich) structures. Additionally, we reported low IC50 of HP and derivatives against HP and SARS-CoV-2 SGP interactions suggesting therapeutic potential of HP as COVID-19 competitive inhibitors. Lastly, unbiased computational ligand docking indicated that a TriS HS oligosaccharide preferably interacts with GAG-binding motifs at the S1/S2 junction and within receptor binding domain and hinted at mechanism of binding. This study adds to our current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and serves a foundation for designing glycoconjugate vaccines and therapeutics to successfully contain and eliminate COVID-19.

SPR competition assay was also used to test the binding preference of SARS-CoV-2 SGP for various GAGs (S1 Fig), including various chondroitin sulfates, dermatan and keratan sulfates, and the results are shown in S5 Fig. Weak or no inhibitory activities were observed for all GAGs tested, suggesting that the binding of SARS-CoV-2 SGP protein to GAGs appears to be HP specific and greatly influenced by the level of sulfation within the GAG.SPR solution competition dose response analysis of HP, Tri-sulfated HS and NACHSolution competition dose response analysis between surface immobilized HP and various soluble glycans (HP, non-anticoagulant trisulfated (TriS) HS, and non-anticoagulant low molecular weight HP (NACH)) was performed to calculate their IC50 values(Figs 4A-4E). SARS-CoV-2 SGP protein (50 nM) samples were pre-mixed with different concentrations of glycans before injection into the HP chip. The sensorgrams(Figs 4A, 4C and 4E)show that once the active binding sites on SARS-CoV-2 SGP were occupied by glycans in solution, the binding of SARS-CoV-2 SGP to the surface-immobilized HP decreased resulting in a reduction of signal in a author/funder.
