In Japan, excluding cruise ships, 349 cases including asymptomatic cases were confirmed, from which six patients died. However, most have been diagnosed as mild cases as of March 6, 2020 [2] . The epidemiological linkage of transmission was probably untraceable already in Japan as of February 18, 2020, as it was in Wuhan. At that time, cluster identification was necessary, but rapid testing was unavailable. Therefore, physicians have been unable to diagnose potential patients especially if they have mild symptoms. Therefore, syndromic surveillance is expected to be as useful as traditional surveillance based on diagnosis by physicians. The present study examines Prescription Surveillance (PS) for detection of some clusters of emerging infectious febrile disease with respiratory symptom including unknown febrile disease with respiratory symptoms [3, 4] as syndromic surveillance.",

For influenza, 2,000 internal medicine care facilities have been added. The sentinel reports are regarded as reliable information because they are based on physicians' diagnoses. Nevertheless, these reports are published weekly after a ten-day delay following diagnosis. For that reason, NOSSID probably cannot detect infectious diseases early.

The probability of aberration for the drug was defined as one minus the probabilities of the numbers of patients prescribed a certain type of drug in PS compared with the number predicted by the model. The probability of a cluster with emerging diseases is the product of the probability of aberration in drugs corresponding to symptoms of the emerging diseases. For example, for COVID-19, because we presume that its typical symptoms are high fever and respiratory symptoms, we can presume that the probability of clusters with unknown febrile disease with respiratory symptoms is the product of the probabilities of aberrations in AP and MIC. This analysis, conducted prospectively in 2020, uses data from October 1, 2010 through 2019 by prefecture and by age class. Age classes were defined as 14 and younger, 15-65, and 65 years and older.

As of the end of September in 2019, ORCA was used at 17,174 medical facilities. ORCA collected information from about 4218 medical facilities as of the end of September, 2019. As inferred from its 100 thousand medical facilities in total, its participation rate was about 4%. Actually, its precision was confirmed for influenza, which was very similar in PS at the nationwide. However precision for other diseases might be insufficient. Even so, because it has other information that is not included in PS, integration of ORCA surveillance and/or (N)SASSy might contribute to improvement of detection of COVID-19 or other emerging infectious diseases.",
