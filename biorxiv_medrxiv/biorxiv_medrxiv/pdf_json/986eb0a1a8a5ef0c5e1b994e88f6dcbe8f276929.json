COVID-19 is characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea and myalgia 2 , but in some patients the infection results in moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for a period of several weeks. COVID-19 patients may present with lymphopenia 2,3 , but the disease has also been associated with immune hyperresponsiveness referred to as 'cytokine storm' 4 . A transient increase in co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR by T-cells, a phenotype of CD8 + Tcell activation in response to viral infection, was observed concomitantly 5 . This increase in both CD4 + and CD8 + CD38 + HLA-DR + T-cells preceded resolution of clinical symptoms in a non-severe, recovered, COVID-19 patient 6 .",

We provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells appear in blood of ARDS patients in the first two weeks post onset of symptoms, and their frequency increases over time. The phenotype of the antigen-specific cellular immune response is balanced; SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + T-cells in blood were typically central memory, CD8 + T-cells typically had a more effector phenotype. It is tempting to speculate that the CD8 + cytotoxic T-cells are predominantly responsible for the production of IFNg, whereas virus-specific CD4 + T-cells could be responsible for the production of typical Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Elevated levels of IL-6 in patient plasma have previously been correlated to respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients 11 . Here, we could not detect increased specific production of IL-6 in PBMC stimulated with peptide pools, suggesting that virus-specific T-cells are not to blame for the production of IL-6 and the concomitant 'cytokine storm', but that these are predominantly mediated by innate immune cells.",

Specific activation of CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells was measured via cell surface expression of CD69 and CD137; phenotyping of memory subsets was based on surface expression of CD45RA and CCR7 (Supplementary Figure 1a-j). Stimulation of PBMC with MP_S and MP_CD4_R led to detection and activation of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 + T-cells (0.89% in COVID-19 vs 0.03% in HC, p=0.0005 for MP_S and 0.49% in COVID-19 vs 0.02% in HC, p=0.0033 for MP_CD4_R, Figure 1d). Overall, the MP_S peptide pool induced stronger responses than the MP_CD4_R peptide pool, indicating that the S surface glycoprotein is a strong inducer of CD4 + T-cell responses. Phenotyping of CD4 + CD69 + CD137 + activated Tcells identified the majority of these SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells as central memory T-cells based on CD45RA and CCR7 expression (T CM ). T CM express homing receptors required for extravasation and migration to secondary lymphoid tissues, but also have high proliferative capacity with low dependence on co-stimulation 8,9 . SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T-cells were activated by both the MP_S and MP_CD8 peptide pools (0.97% in COVID-19 vs 0.03% in HC, p=0.0002 for MP_S and 0.26% in COVID-19 vs 0.02% in HC, p=0.0002 for MP_CD8, Figure 1e), confirming that the S surface glycoprotein also induces CD8 + T-cell responses.

Within the CD4 and CD8 subsets, memory subsets were gated as CD45RA + CCR7 + (naive, T n ), CD45RA -, CCR7 + (central memory, T CM ), CD45RA -CCR7 -(effector memory, T EM ) or CD45RA + CCR7 -(terminally differentiated effectors, T EMRA ). T-cells specifically activated by SARS-CoV-2 were identified by upregulation of CD69 and CD137. An average of 500,000 cells was always acquired, the gating strategy is schematically represented in (Supplementary Figure 1A-J).
