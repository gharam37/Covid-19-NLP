Among the standard models for COVID-19 global pandemic prediction, simple epidemiological and statistical models have received more attention by authorities, and they are popular in the media. Due to a high level of uncertainty and lack of essential data, standard models have shown low accuracy for long-term prediction. Although the literature includes several attempts to address this issue, the essential generalization and robustness abilities of existing models needs to be improved. This paper presents a comparative analysis of machine learning and soft computing models to predict the COVID-19 outbreak. Among a wide range of machine learning models investigated, two models showed promising results (i.e., multi-layered perceptron, MLP, and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system, ANFIS). Based on the results reported here, and due to the highly complex nature of the COVID-19 outbreak and variation in its behavior from nation-to-nation, this study suggests machine learning as an effective tool to model the outbreak.

Governments and other legislative bodies rely on insights from prediction models to suggest new policies and to assess the effectiveness of the enforced policies [1] . The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID -19) has been reported to infect more than 2 million people, with more than 132,000 confirmed deaths worldwide. The recent global COVID-19 pandemic has exhibited a nonlinear and complex nature [2] . In addition, the outbreak has differences with other recent outbreaks, which brings into question the ability of standard models to deliver accurate results [3] . Besides the numerous known and unknown variables involved in the spread, the complexity of population-wide behavior in various geopolitical areas and differences in containment strategies had dramatically increased model uncertainty [4] . Consequently, standard epidemiological models face new challenges to deliver more reliable results. To overcome this challenge, many novel models have emerged which introduce several assumptions to modeling (e.g., adding social distancing in the form of curfews, quarantines, etc.) [5] [6] [7] .",

The modeling strategy is formed around the assumption of transmitting the infectious disease through contacts, considering three different classes of well-mixed populations; susceptible to infection (class S), infected (class I), and the removed population (class R is devoted to those who have recovered, developed immunity, been isolated or passed away). It is further assumed that the class I transmits the infection to class S where the number of probable transmissions is proportional to the total number of contacts [9] [10] [11] . The number of individuals in the class S progresses as a time-series, often computed using a basic differential equation as follows:",

            "text": "The outbreaks of a wide range of infectious diseases have been modeled using Eq. 4. However, for the COVID-19 outbreak prediction, due to the strict measures enforced by authorities, the susceptibility to infection has been manipulated dramatically. For example, in China, Italy, France, Hungary and Spain the SIR model cannot present promising results, as individuals committed voluntarily to quarantine and limited their social interaction. However, for countries where containment measures were delayed (e.g., United States) the model has shown relative accuracy [12] . Figure. 1 shows the inaccuracy of conventional models applied to the outbreak in Italy by comparing the actual number of confirmed infections and epidemiological model predictions 1 . The SEIR models through considering the significant incubation period during which individuals have been infected showed progress in improving the model accuracy for Varicella and Zika outbreak [13, 14] . SEIR models assume that the incubation period is a random variable and similarly to the SIR model, there would be a disease-free-equilibrium [15, 16] . It is worth mentioning that SEIR model will not work well where the parameters are non-stationary through time [17] . A key cause of non-stationarity is where the social mixing (which determines the contact network) changes through time. Social mixing determines the reproductive number 0 which is the number of susceptible individuals that an infected person will infect. Where 0 is less than 1 the epidemic will die out. Where it is greater than 1 it will spread. 0 for COVID-19 prior to lockdown was estimated as a massive 4 presenting a pandemic. It is expected that lockdown measures should bring 0 down to less than 1. the KEY reason why SEIR models are difficult to fit for COVID-19 is non-stationarity of mixing, caused by nudging (step-by-step) intervention measures.",

Often to acquire information on class R, several novel models included data from social media or call data records (CDR), which showed promising results [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . However, observation of the behavior of COVID-19 in several countries demonstrates a high degree of uncertainty and complexity [26] . Thus, for epidemiological models to be able to deliver reliable results, they must be adapted to the local situation with an insight into susceptibility to infection [27] . This imposes a huge limit on the generalization ability and robustness of conventional models. Advancing accurate models with a great generalization ability to be scalable to model both the regional and global pandemic is, thus, essential [28] .",

Table 1 represents notable ML methods used for outbreak prediction. These ML methods are limited to the basic methods of random forest, neural networks, Bayesian networks, Na\u00efve Bayes, genetic programming and classification and regression tree (CART). Although ML has long been established as a standard tool for modeling natural disasters and weather forecasting [44, 45] , its application in modeling outbreak is still in the early stages. More sophisticated ML methods (e.g., hybrids, ensembles) are yet to be explored. Consequently, the contribution of this paper is to explore the application of ML for modeling the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper aims to investigate the generalization ability of the proposed ML models and the accuracy of the proposed models for different lead-times. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

Figure 2 presents the total case number (cumulative statistic) for the considered countries. Currently, to contain the outbreak, the governments have implemented various measures to reduce transmission through inhibiting people's movements and social activities. Although for advancing the epidemiological models information on changes in social distancing is essential, for modeling with machine learning no assumption is required. As can be seen in Figure 2 , the growth rate in China is greater than that for Italy, Iran, Germany and the USA in the early weeks of the disease. The next step is to find the best model for the estimation of the time-series data. Logistic, Linear, Logarithmic, Quadratic, Cubic, Compound, Power and exponential equations ( Table 2 ) are employed to develop the desired model. A, B, C, \u00b5, and L are parameters (constants) that characterize the above-mentioned functions. These constants need to be estimated to develop an accurate estimation model. One of the goals of this study was to model time-series data based on the logistic microbial growth model. For this purpose, the modified equation of logistic regression was used to estimate and predict the prevalence (i.e., I/Population at a given time point) of disease as a function of time. Estimation of the parameters was performed using evolutionary algorithms like GA, particle swarm optimizer, and the grey wolf optimizer. These algorithms are discussed in the following.",

GA maintains vital information stored in these chromosome data structures by applying \"Recombination Operators\" to chromosome-like data structures [50] [51] [52] [53] . In many cases, GAs are employed as \"Function Optimizer\" algorithms, which are algorithms used to optimize \"Objective Functions.\" Of course, the range of applications that use the GA to solve problems is very wide [52, 54] . The implementation of the GA usually begins with the production of a population of chromosomes generated randomly and bound up and down by the variables of the problem. In the next step, the generated data structures (chromosomes) are evaluated, and chromosomes that can better display the optimal solution of the problem are more likely to be used to produce new chromosomes. The degree of \"goodness\" of an answer is usually measured by the population of the current candidate's answers [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . The main algorithm of a GA process is demonstrated in Figure 3 . In the present study, GA [59] was employed for estimation of the parameters of Eq. 6 to 13. The population number was selected to be 300 and the maximum generation (as iteration number) was determined to be 500 according to different trial and error processes to reduce the cost function value.

The algorithm was inspired by the mass movement of birds looking for food. A group of birds accidentally looked for food in a space. There is only one piece of food in the search space. Each solution in PSO is called a particle, which is equivalent to a bird in the bird's mass movement algorithm. Each particle has a value that is calculated by a competency function which increases as the particle in the search space approaches the target (food in the bird's movement model). Each particle also has a velocity that guides the motion of the particle. Each particle continues to move in the problem space by tracking the optimal particles in the current state [60] [61] [62] . The PSO method is rooted in Reynolds' work, which is an early simulation of the social behavior of birds. The mass of particles in nature represents collective intelligence. Consider the collective movement of fish in water or birds during migration. All members move in perfect harmony with each other, hunt together if they are to be hunted, and escape from the clutches of a predator by moving another prey if they are to be preyed upon [63] [64] [65] . Particle properties in this algorithm include [65-67]:",

This algorithm operates according to possible rules, not definite rules. Therefore, PSO is a random optimization algorithm that can search for unspecified and complex areas. This makes PSO more flexible and durable than conventional methods. PSO deals with nondifferential target functions because the PSO uses the information result (performance index or target function to guide the search in the problem area). The quality of the proposed route response does not depend on the initial population. Starting from anywhere in the search space, the algorithm ultimately converges on the optimal answer. PSO has great flexibility to control the balance between the local and overall search space. This unique PSO property overcomes the problem of improper convergence and increases the search capacity. All of these features make PSO different from the GA and other innovative algorithms [61, 65, 67] .",

In general, there are four categories of wolves among the herd of grey wolves, alpha, beta, delta and omega. Alpha wolves are at the top of the herd's leadership pyramid, and the rest of the wolves take orders from the alpha group and follow them (usually there is only one wolf as an alpha wolf in each herd). Beta wolves are in the lower tier, but their superiority over Delta and omega wolves allows them to provide advice and help to alpha wolves. Beta wolves are responsible for regulating and orienting the herd based on alpha movement. Delta wolves, which are next in line for the power pyramid in the wolf herd, are usually made up of guards, elderly population, caregivers of damaged wolves, and so on. Omega wolves are also the weakest in the power hierarchy [70] . Eq. 15 to 18 are used to model the hunting tool:",

Let X t be a time-series vector, in which xt is the outbreak at time point t and T is the set of all equidistant time points. To train ML methods effectively, we defined two scenarios, listed in Table 3 . As can be seen in Table 3 , scenario 1 employs data for three weeks to predict the outbreak on day t and scenario 2 employs outbreak data for five days to predict the outbreak for day t. Both of these scenarios were employed for fitting the ML methods. In the present research, two frequently used ML methods, the multi-layered perceptron (MLP) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) are employed for the prediction of the outbreak in the five countries.",

The key element of this idea is the new structure of the information processing system [76] [77] [78] . The system is made up of several highly interconnected processing elements called neurons that work together to solve a problem [78, 79] . ANNs, like humans, learn by example. The neural network is set up during a learning process to perform specific tasks, such as identifying patterns and categorizing information. In biological systems, learning is regulated by the synaptic connections between nerves. This method is also used in neural networks [80] . By processing experimental data, ANNs transfer knowledge or a law behind the data to the network structure, which is called learning. Basically, learning ability is the most important feature of such a smart system. A learning system is more flexible and easier to plan, so it can better respond to new issues and changes in processes [81] .",

This approach was developed in the early 1990s. Since this system integrates the concepts of neural networks and fuzzy logic, it can take advantage of both capabilities in a unified framework. This technique is one of the most frequently used and robust hybrid ML techniques. It is consistent with a set of fuzzy if-then rules that can be learned to approximate nonlinear functions [87, 88] . Hence, ANFIS was proposed as a universal estimator. An important element of fuzzy systems is the fuzzy partition of the input space [89, 90] . For input k, the fuzzy rules in the input space make a k faces fuzzy cube. Achieving a flexible partition for nonlinear inversion is non-trivial. The idea of this model is to build a neural network whose outputs are a degree of the input that belongs to each class [91] [92] [93] . The membership functions (MFs) of this model can be nonlinear, multidimensional and, thus, different to conventional fuzzy systems [94] [95] [96] . In ANFIS, neural networks are used to increase the efficiency of fuzzy systems. The method used to design neural networks is to employ fuzzy systems or fuzzy-based structures. This model is a kind of division and conquest method. Instead of using one neural network for all the input and output data, several networks are created in this model: \u2022",

According to Tables 5 to 12 , GWO provided the highest accuracy (smallest RMSE and largest correlation coefficient) and smallest processing time compared to PSO and GA for fitting the logistic, linear, logarithmic, quadratic, cubic, power, compound, and exponential-based equations for all five countries. It can be suggested that GWO is a sustainable optimizer due to its acceptable processing time compared with PSO and GA. Therefore, GWO was selected as the best optimizer by providing the highest accuracy values compared with PSO and GA. In general, it can be claimed that GWO, by suggesting the best parameter values for the functions presented in Table 2 , increases outbreak prediction accuracy for COVID-19 in comparison with PSO and GA.

The logistic model outperformed other methods and showed promising results on training for 30 days. Extrapolation of the prediction beyond the original observation range of 30-days should not be expected to be realistic considering the new statistics. The fitted models generally showed low accuracy and also weak generalization ability for the five countries. Although the prediction for China was promising, the model was insufficient for extrapolation, as expected. In turn, the logistic GWO outperformed the PSO and GA and the computational cost for GWO was reported as satisfactory. Consequently, for further assessment of the ML models, the logistic model fitted with GWO was used for comparative analysis.",

Scenario 1 considered four data samples from the progress of the infection from previous days, as reported in table 3. The sampling for data processing was done weekly for scenario 1. However, scenario 2 was devoted to daily sampling for all previous consecutive days. Providing these two scenarios expanded the scope of this study. Training and test results for the two machine learning models (MLP and ANFIS) were considered for the two scenarios. A detailed investigation was also carried out to explore the most suitable number of neurons. For the MLP, the performances of using 8, 12 and 16 neurons were analyzed throughout the study. For the ANFIS, the membership function (MF) types of Tri, Trap, and Gauss were analyzed throughout the study. The five counties of Italy, China, Iran, Germany, and USA were considered. The performance of both ML models for these countries varied amongst the two different scenarios. Given the observed results, it is not possible to select the most suitable scenario. Therefore, both daily and weekly sampling can be used in machine learning modeling. Comparison between analytical and machine learning models using the deviation from the target value (figures 17 to 21) indicated that the MLP in both scenarios delivered the most accurate results. Extrapolation for long-term prediction of up to 150 days using the ML models was tested. The actual prediction of MLP and ANFIS for the five countries was reported which showed the progression of the outbreak.",

Advancement of accurate prediction models for the outbreak is essential to provide insights into the spread and consequences of this infectious disease. Due to the high level of uncertainty and lack of crucial data, standard epidemiological models have shown low accuracy for long-term prediction. This paper presents a comparative analysis of ML and soft computing models to predict the COVID-19 outbreak. The results of two ML models (MLP and ANFIS) reported a high generalization ability for long-term prediction. With respect to the results reported in this paper and due to the highly complex nature of the COVID-19 outbreak and differences from nation-to-nation, this study suggests ML as an effective tool to model the outbreak.",
