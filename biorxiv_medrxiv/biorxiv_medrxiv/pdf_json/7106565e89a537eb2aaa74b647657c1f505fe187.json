One major hurdle in controlling the spreading of this disease is the inefficiency and shortage of medical tests. There have been increasing efforts on developing deep learning methods to diagnose COVID-19 based on CT scans. However, these works are difficult to reproduce and adopt since the CT data used in their studies are not publicly available. Besides, these works require a large number of CTs to train accurate diagnosis models, which are difficult to obtain. In this paper, we aim to address these two problems. We build a publicly-available dataset containing hundreds of CT scans positive for COVID-19 and develop sample-efficient deep learning methods that can achieve high diagnosis accuracy of COVID-19 from CT scans even when the number of training CT images are limited. Specifically, we propose an Self-Trans approach, which synergistically integrates contrastive self-supervised learning with transfer learning to learn powerful and unbiased feature representations for reducing the risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed Self-Trans approach compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. Our approach achieves an F1 of 0.85 and an AUC of 0.94 in diagnosing COVID-19 from CT scans, even though the number of training CTs is just a few hundred.",

One major hurdle in controlling the spreading of this disease is the inefficiency and shortage of tests. The current tests are mostly based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). It takes 4-6 hours to obtain results, which is a long time compared with the rapid spreading rate of COVID-19. Besides inefficiency, RT-PCR test kits are in huge shortage. As a result, many infected cases cannot be timely identified and continue to infect others unconsciously.",

            "text": "To mitigate the inefficiency and shortage of existing tests for COVID-19, many efforts have been devoted to searching for alternative testing methods. Several studies [1] have shown that computed tomography (CT) scans manifest clear radiological findings of COVID-19 patients and are promising in serving as a more efficient and accessible testing manner due to the wide availability of CT devices that can generate results at a fast speed. Further, to alleviate the burden of medical professionals in reading CT scans, several works [2] have developed deep learning methods that can automatically interpret CT images and predict whether the CTs are positive for COVID-19. While these works have shown promising results, they have two limitations. First, the CT scan datasets used in these works are not sharable to the public due to privacy concerns. Consequently, their results cannot be reproduced and the trained models cannot be used in other hospitals. Besides, the lack of opensourced annotated COVID-19 CT dataset greatly hinders the research and development of more advanced AI methods for more accurate CT-based testing of COVID-19. Second, these works require a large collection of CTs during model training to achieve performance that meets the clinical standard. Such a requirement is stringent in practice and may not be met by many hospitals, especially under the circumstances that medical professionals are highly occupied by taking care of COVID-19 patients and are unlikely to have time to collect and annotate a large number of COVID-19 CT scans.",

We first collect the COVID19-CT dataset, which contains 349 CT images with clinical findings of 216 COVID-19 patient cases. The images are collected from medRxiv and bioRxiv papers about COVID-19. CTs containing COVID-19 abnormalities are selected by reading the figure captions in the papers. We manually remove artifacts in the original images, such as texts, numbers, arrows, etc. Figure 1 shows some examples of the COVID-19 CT scans. To our best knowledge, it is the largest COVID-19 CT dataset to date. And all the images are open to the public for research purpose. Given this dataset, we develop deep learning (DL) methods to perform CT-based diagnosis of COVID-19. Though largest among its kind, COVID19-CT is still limited in image number. DL models are data-hungry, which have high risk of overfitting when trained on smallsized dataset. To address this problem, we develop sampleefficient methods to train highly-performant DL model in spite of data deficiency. Specifically, we investigate two paradigms of learning approaches for mitigating data deficiency: transfer learning and self-supervised learning.",

One commonly used strategy is to learn a powerful visual feature extraction deep network by pretraining this network on large datasets in the source tasks and then adapt this pretrained network to the target task by finetuning the network weights on the smallsized dataset in the target task. While effective in general, transfer learning may be suboptimal due to the fact that the source data may have a large discrepancy with the target data in terms of visual appearance of images and class labels, which causes the feature extraction network biased to the source data and generalizes less well on the target data. We design different transferring strategies and perform a comprehensive study in the dimensions of source-target domain difference and neural architectures to investigate the effects of transfer learning for COVID-19 diagnosis and provide insightful findings.",

In self-supervised learning (SSL), we construct auxiliary tasks on CT images where the supervised labels in these tasks are solely from the images themselves without using any human annotations. Then we adjust the network weights by solving these auxiliary tasks. In these auxiliary tasks, the input images are in the same domain as the data in the target task and no human-annotated labels are used. Therefore, the bias to source images and their class labels can be effectively reduced.",

This idea has been successfully applied to visual recognition [21] as well as language comprehension [22] . In the medical domain, transfer learning has also been widely used in medical image classification and recognition tasks, such as tumor classification [23] , retinal diseases diagnosis [24] , pneumonia detection [25] , and skin lesion and cancer classification [26] , [27] . A recent study in [28] explores the properties of transfer learning for medical imaging tasks and finds that the standard large networks pretrained on ImageNet are often over-parameterized and may not be the optimal solution for medical image diagnosis. In this paper, we continue to investigate different strategies of transfer learning and integrate contrastive self-supervised learning into the transfer learning process to learn powerful and unbiased feature representations for reducing the risk of overfitting.",

It creates auxiliary tasks solely using the input data and forces deep networks to learn highly-effective latent features by solving these auxiliary tasks. Various strategies have been proposed to construct auxiliary tasks, based on temporal correspondence [29] , [30] , cross-modal consistency [31] , etc. Examples of auxiliary tasks include rotation prediction [32] , image inpainting [33] , automatic colorization [34] , context prediction [35] , etc. Some recent works study self-supervised representation learning based on instance discrimination [36] with contrastive learning. Oord et al. propose contrastive predictive coding (CPC) to extract useful representations from high-dimensional data [37] . Bachman et al. propose a selfsupervised representation learning approach based on maximizing mutual information between features extracted from multiple views of a shared context [38] . Most recently, Chen et al. present a simple framework for contrastive learning (SimCLR) [39] with larger batch sizes and extensive data augmentation [40] , which achieves results that are comparable with supervised learning. Momentum Contrast (MoCo) [41] , [42] expands the idea of contrastive learning with an additional dictionary and a momentum encoder.

To address this problem, we systematically investigate different transfer learning strategies and propose a new approach called Self-Trans, which synergistically integrates unsupervised in-domain selfsupervised learning with supervised out-of-domain transfer learning to learn effective and unbiased visual feature representations that are robust to overfitting.

A commonly used approach [45] is to pretrain a deep neural network -which is used for feature extraction -on large datasets in the source tasks by fitting the humanannotated labels therein, then fine-tune this pretrained network on the target task. In our case, we can take a classic neural architecture such as ResNet [46] and its weights pretrained on large-scale image classification datasets such as ImageNet, then fine-tune it on the COVID19-CT dataset, with the goal of transferring the images and classes labels in ImageNet into our task for mitigate the deficiency of COVID-19 CTs. When applying this strategy, we should keep several caveats in mind. First, the image data in source tasks have a large domain discrepancy with COVID-19 CTs. For example, the ImageNet images mostly belong to categories in the general domain, such as cat, dog, chair, etc. whereas the images in our task are CTs. The visual appearance, size, resolution of ImageNet images are quite different from chest CTs. As a result, the visual representations learned on ImageNet may not be able to represent CT images well, which casts doubts on the transferability from other sources of images to COVID-19",

Self-supervised learning (SSL) [36] , [39] , [41] , [42] is a learning paradigm which aims to capture the intrinsic patterns and properties of input data (e.g., CT images) without using human-provided labels. The basic idea of SSL is to construct some auxiliary tasks solely based on the data itself without using human-annotated labels and force the network to learn meaningful representations by performing the auxiliary tasks well. Typical selfsupervised learning approaches generally involve two aspects: constructing auxiliary tasks and defining loss functions. The auxiliary tasks are designed to encourage the model to learn meaningful representations of input data without utilizing human annotations. The loss functions are defined to measure the difference between a model's prediction and a fixed target, the similarities of sample pairs in a representation space (e.g., contrastive loss), or the difference between probability distributions (e.g., adversarial loss). In this work, we design the auxiliary tasks based on the contrastive loss [41] , [42] , [51] to provide self-supervision for the transfer learning process. To be specific, the auxiliary task is to judge whether two images created via random data augmentation are augments of the same original image. We build a large and consistent dictionary on-the-fly based on the contrastive loss to fulfill this auxiliary task. To fully explore the structure and information of the CT images, we apply Self-Trans on both external large-scale lung CT datasets and our collected COVID19-CT dataset. 1) Contrastive learning for self-supervision: Given an original image in the dataset, contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) [51] performs data augmentation of this image and obtains two augmented images: x q and x k , where the first one is referred to as query and the second one as key. Two networks f q (\u00b7; \u03b8 q ) and f k (\u00b7; \u03b8 k ), referred to as the query encoder and the key encoder and parameterized by weights \u03b8 q and \u03b8 k , are used to obtain latent representations -q = f q (x q ; \u03b8 q ) and k = f k (x k ; \u03b8 k ) -of the query and key images respectively. A query and a key belonging to the same image are labeled as a positive pair. A query and a key belonging to different images are labeled as a negative pair. The auxiliary task is: given a (query, key) pair, judging whether it is positive or negative.",

This method is straightforward but incredibly expensive in terms of computational resources. Another option is to store the representations of historical keys in a negative key dictionary D k = {k i }, called memory bank [36] . At each iteration, a mini-batch of keys are sampled from the memory bank instead of using f k . The current mini-batch of queries are updated to the memory bank for replacement.

This demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning, which leverages large-scale images and their class labels in source tasks to help with the learning of the target task. In certain cases, the benefits of transfer learning are highly significant. For example, for VGG16, when trained with random initialization, it performs the poorest. Transfer learning helps it to improve accuracy by 10% (absolute improvement), F1 by 8% (absolute), and AUC by 8% (absolute), exceeding the performance of networks (e.g., ResNet) that have more sophisticated architectures designed for preventing overfitting, even when these networks are pretrained as well.",

This is probably because a small-sized network is more robust to overfitting, therefore it has a smaller need of using transfer learning for combating overfitting. On the contrary, for large-sized neural architectures such as VGG-16, initialization with pretrained weights makes a huge difference. The reason is that large-sized networks are more prone to overfitting, especially considering that our dataset is fairly small. Under such circumstances, transfer learning has a better chance to play its value. Table IV shows the performance of the DenseNet-169 backbone with weights (1) randomly initialized, (2) pretrained on ImageNet, (3) pretrained on LMN, and (4) pretrained first on ImageNet, then on LMN. From this table, we make the following observations. First, transfer learning on either ImageNet or LMN improves performance, which further demonstrates the efficacy of transfer learning. Second, the performance of the network pretrained on ImageNet has no significant difference with that pretrained on LMN (the former has slightly better accuracy but worse F1). The two datasets have both advantages and disadvantages. ImageNet has more images and more classes than LMN, which enables learning more powerful and generalizable feature representations. The downside of ImageNet is that its images have a large domain discrepancy with the CTs in COVID19-CT whereas the images in LMN are all CTs. The advantages and disadvantages of these two datasets make them similar in providing transfer learning values. Pretraining first on ImageNet then on LMN achieves better performance than just pretraining on ImageNet. This shows that using data with complementary properties (e.g., size, domain similarity) can generate a synergistic effect in transfer learning.",

After CSSL training, we fine-tune the weights on both the CTs and the class labels by optimizing the classification loss. 1) Self-supervised baselines: To address the effectiveness of self-supervision, we also establish a baseline model with self-supervised auxiliary task.

Table VI shows the results in different ablation study settings, conducted on ResNet-50 and DenseNet-169 backbones. From this table, we observe the following. First, Method 2 which performs SSL on top of transfer learning works much better than Method 1 which performs SSL without using transfer learning. This demonstrates that it is more effective to apply SSL on pretrained weights instead of from scratch. Second, Method 2 which performs SSL on COVID19-CT (without using labels) largely outperforms Method 3 which performs SSL on LUNA. This implies that it is more effective to apply SSL directly on the data in the target task than on external data. Third, comparing Method 3 and Self-Trans, it is further confirmed that performing SSL directly on the data of the target task achieves better performance (by Self-Trans). Forth, Method 4 with an SSL auxiliary task beats the vanilla transfer learning counterpart, but do not surpass the SSL model with contrastive learning in Method 2 and Self-Trans. Such experimental results not only illustrate the effectiveness of SSL, but also provide concrete evidence that CSSL has stronger feature representation learning capabilities than traditional SSL methods.

            "text": "Another thing that we are interested in investigating is: given the weights of the feature extractor learned by SSL, when finetuning the overall classification network on the COVID19-CT images and labels, should we just fine-tune the final classifier layer or fine-tune the weights of the feature extractor as well? Table VII shows the results on two backbones: ResNet-50 and DenseNet-169, where \"frozen\" denotes that the weights of the feature extractor are not fine-tuned during the finetuning process and \"unfrozen\" denotes that these weights are fine-tuned together with those in the final classification layer. As can be seen, fine-tuning feature extraction weights yields much better performance. This is because using class labels to fine-tune these weights can make the extracted features more discriminative and hence more effective in distinguishing COVID-19 CTs from Non-COVID-19 CTs. Figure 5 shows the Grad-CAM [58] visualizations for DenseNet-169 trained from baseline methods and our proposed Self-Trans. By comparing Column (3) with Column (5), we notice that the DenseNet-169 model trained with random initialization erroneously focuses on some image edges and corners that are not related to COVID-19. In contrast, transfer learning methods generally lead to more accurate diseaserelated visual localization. By comparing Column (5) with Column (7), we can see that our proposed Self-Trans method can have even better localization of the disease region than the ImageNet pretrained method.",

To facilitate the open research in this area, we build COVID19-CT, a dataset containing 349 CT scans positive for COVID-19. To our best knowledge, it is the largest COVID19-CT dataset that is publicly available to date. Though the largest, it still incurs a high risk of overfitting for data-hungry deep learning models. To reduce this risk, we develop data efficient methods that are able to mitigate data deficiency. We propose Self-Trans, a self-supervised transfer learning approach that learns expressive and unbiased visual feature representations that are robust to overfitting. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063941 doi: medRxiv preprint",

For example, the images in ImageNet are mostly in the natural image domain while the images in COVID-19 diagnosis tasks are from the medical domain. Second, in transfer learning, pretraining is conducted by fitting the class labels in the source domain and these classes are largely different from those in the target task. For example, the classes in ImageNet are mostly about non-medical concepts such as dog, cat, desk, etc. while the labels in our target task are COVID and Non-COVID.",
