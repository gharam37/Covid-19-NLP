            "text": "ABSTRACT 23 In social species where offspring are reared together in communal burrows or similar 24 structures, young animals typically do not engage in between-group contact during their 25 developmenta behavioural trait we call 'offspring with restricted between-group contact' 26 (ORC). The impact of this trait on the persistence of contagious pathogens that generate 27 lifelong immunity in their hosts is currently unclear. We hypothesize that in populations with 28 ORC, the formation, in groups, of a 'protective barrier' of only recovered adults, prevents the 29 transmission of this type of pathogens to the new susceptible hosts (i.e. young animals), 30 thereby increasing the probability of epidemic fade-out. We implement a spatially implicit 31 individual-based Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model for a large range of host and 32 pathogen traits and show that the epidemic fade-out probability is consistently higher in 33 populations with ORC, especially when disease spread is fast (high basic reproduction 34 number R0). We also show that ORC can counteract the cost of group-living in terms of 35 disease risk to a greater extent than variation in other traits. We discuss our findings in INTRODUCTION 42 Pathogens of infectious diseases that spread through direct contact or physical proximity can 43 imperil species that live in dense populations or large social groups, including humans, 44 livestock or wildlife (Altizer et al. 2003 . 53 A social network can further be characterized by its modularity, that is, its degree of division 54 into modules such as social groups (e.g. clans, prides or troops) or subgroups (e.g. age classes 55 in the case of eusocial insects, Stroeymeyt et al. 2018 , also see Griffin and Nunn 2012, Sah et 56 al. 2017). Generally, a social network is considered to be highly modular, or to have a high 57 'community structure' (White et al. 2017 ) when individuals within one module are more 58 connected to each other than they are to individuals in other modules (Newman 2006 ). It has 59 been hypothesized that a highly modular social network can generally reduce disease risk in 60 group-living animals (Griffin and Nunn 2012, Nunn et al. 2015 ). Yet this view has been 61 recently challenged by a study which found that the beneficial effects of modularity on 62 disease fade-out are restricted to extreme cases of exceptionally high modularity, which are 63 rarely observed in natural systems (Sah et al. 2017) . 64 Here we investigate how highly modular social networks characterized by age-dependent networks where young animals have no contact with members of other groups, and term this 67 life history trait 'offspring with restricted between-group contact' (ORC). 68 In contrast to most ungulate species for instance, in which precocial young follow their 69 mother shortly after birth (Lent 1974) , several group-living species rear their offspring in 70 communal burrows, nurseries, cr\u00e8ches or family groups within group territories or home 71 ranges for extended periods of time, during which time young rarely if ever contact 72 individuals of other groups. This includes for instance spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta 73 (Kruuk 1972), African lions Panthera leo (Schaller 1972) or European rabbits Oryctolagus 74 cuniculus (Daly 1981). 75 Restricting contact of young animals with individuals of other groups may specifically limit 76 the persistence of pathogens that induce lifelong immunity following infection. Such Here we used an individual-based model to investigate for the first time this second 96 mechanism and test the prediction that the probability of epidemic fade-out increases in 97 populations (i.e. networks) of social species with an ORC trait. For this purpose, we 98 developed an SIR model to describe pathogen transmission and host population dynamics. In 99 order to assess how consistently the probability of epidemic fade-out increased due to ORC, 100 we systematically varied parameters likely to influence pathogen transmission dynamics: (1) 101 host birth rate, (2) host death rate (which occurs independently of infection), (3) contact rates 102 between members of different groups, (4) infection rate at contact, (5) individual infection 103 length, (6) virulence (i.e. the increase in host death rate due to infection), and (7) whether 104 transmission is frequency or density-dependent. For each specific combination of parameters, 105 we investigated two scenarios. First, we set up a baseline scenario in which rates of between-106 group contact were identical for individuals of all ages. Second, we investigated an ORC 107 scenario in which individuals below a given age-threshold could not contact members of 108 other groups, i.e. their rates of between-group contact were set to zero. This is simulating the 109 legal requirements of confinement put into action by authorities to limit the spread of 110 pandemics, e.g. during the COVID-19 pandemic; the closure of schools and prevention of 111 contact between young and elderly people, including within households (e.g. Anderson et al. 112 2020, Kelvin and Halperin 2020). Because ORC decreases R0, we adjusted the infection rate 113 in the baseline scenario such that the value of R0 was always identical in both scenarios to 114 insure that the emergence of a more efficient immunity barrier are directly related to the ORC 115 trait, and not to its mediated effect on R0. We discuss our results in relation to behavioural mechanisms yielding herd immunity as well as the likely outcomes of altering social network 117 modularity through management measures.",

The probability that an individual at a reproductive age of 2 years and 194 more (Age-repro \u2265 104 weeks) gave birth to one offspring was given by fage. and 195 corresponded to approximately 1 -3 offspring per year. 196 The fourth process (dispersal) described individuals which left their natal group as they 197 became reproductively mature. 198 In the last process (ageing), we updated the individual's state variable age as well as the time-199 span-infected counter. The initialization of the age of individuals was determined by a random exponential 202 distribution with a mean set at the age at first reproduction (Age-repro = 104 weeks, Table   203 1). All groups were set with a certain size and all individuals were set as susceptible, except 204 one who was set as infected. Pathogen invasion started stochastically with this one infected 205 individual chosen randomly in the initial population. The total population was at a carrying 206 capacity of 1000 individuals at the beginning of the simulations to make simulation runs 207 comparable, but the number of groups was given depending on the initialized number of 208 individuals per group (see also Table 1 ).",

When looking at a single epidemic event in a 330 host population with ORC, we found that a new pool of susceptible juveniles (free from the 331 disease) emerged in the population a few weeks after initialization to form a peak, followed 332 by an increase in the number of susceptible adults ( figure 4 (a) ). The epidemic faded out from 333 the host population approximately 50 weeks after the initialization, both in terms of the 334 number of infected juveniles and infected adults ( figure 4(b) ).

Understanding the patterns of transmission and the mechanisms of persistence of 46 such diseases in group-living species is thus of key relevance for human public health, 47 economy or wildlife conservation. The structure of social contact networks in group-living 48 species may critically influence the spread and persistence of contagious diseases (Kappeler 49 et al. 2015). For example, if a social network contains a few central individuals who are 50 exceptionally well connected to others, then these individuals can act as super-spreaders and 51 their presence can strongly increase the likelihood and extent of an epidemic as well as the 52 persistence of pathogens (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005)",

First, as a rather trivial effect, by restricting contact of young animals with 83 members of other groups, ORC could directly reduce the probability of disease spread and 84 hence also the basic reproduction number R0 of a pathogen, which is the expected number of 85 secondary infections that a single infected host causes in a population of susceptible 86 individuals (McCallum et al. 2001). Second, ORC could increase the chance of epidemic 87 fade-out by depriving the pathogen of access to susceptible individuals during the late stage 88 of an epidemic. Indeed, when most adults in the population have become immune (and thus 89 herd immunity (see e.g. Anderson and May 1985) is high, the chance of pathogen spread to 90 mostly susceptible young animals would be substantially curtailed.

Sah et al. (2017) found that network modularity limited 393 disease spread only when modularity was very high, i.e. when individuals within one module 394 were more connected to each other than they were to individuals in other modules (Newman 395 2006). Here we showed that an ORC trait had a particularly positive effect for the host 396 population in terms of epidemic fade-out for hosts with a high contact ratio, hence in 397 networks of initially low modularity (figure 3). When the contact ratio was high, the pathogen 398 could more easily spread between groups and was less likely to die out quickly; thus 399 restricting offspring's between-group contact could bring more benefits than when the 400 contact ratio was low.

Such 'bridging' individuals could be dispersing individuals in the 410 case of rabies in foxes or raccoons (Reynolds et al. 2015), bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in 411 badgers (Weber et al. 2013) or Classical Swine Fever (CSF) in wild boars (Scherer et al. 412 2020). Neglecting the potentially important influence of between-group interactions on 413 disease spread, in combination with the disturbance of populations through persecution and 414 hunting, may have been responsible for the failure of disease elimination programmes for 415 bTB (Vial and Donnelly 2011) or CSF in Germany (Scherer et al. 2019).

One 442 typical example of such a pathogen in group-forming wildlife is canine distemper virus 443 (CDV) (Appel and Summers 1995) or the now eradicated rinderpest (Daszak et al. 2000). 444 Both morbiliviruses are highly contagious and some strains can cause massive mortality in 445 wildlife.

This figure shows that the difference in 689fade-out probabilities is almost always (highly) positive only for the parameter age at first 690 between-group contact. Regression tree of the differences in the epidemic fade-out probability between 692 host populations whose 'offspring had restricted between-group contact' (ORC) vs those who 693 did not, across all simulated parameters. The method consisted in splitting the parameter 694 space into binary groups, which differed in terms of difference in fade-out probabilities695    successively, using the ANOVA method.

Spotted hyenas in 144 the Serengeti National Park give birth throughout the year (East et al. 2003, Hofer and East 145 2003) hence communal dens typically contain susceptible young for much of the year. Females remain in their natal clan whereas most males disperse when approximately four 147 years old (East and Hofer 2001). However, we did not investigate sex differences in our 148 model as they were not relevant to our question. We used the parameters survival probability, 149 age at first reproduction and the probability of reproducing (from Marescot et al. 2018 and 150 references therein). Please note that we did not develop a 'hyena model' per se, rather a 151 realistic host-pathogen model to test our theory with (Railsback et al. 2020).
