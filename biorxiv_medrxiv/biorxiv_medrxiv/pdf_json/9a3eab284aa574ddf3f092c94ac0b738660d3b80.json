Two recent studies have suggested a link between the BCG vaccination policy and the morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. In the present study we compared the impact of COVID-19 in terms of case fatality rates (CFR) between countries with high disease burden and those with BCG revaccination policies presuming that revaccination practices would have provided added protection to the population against severe COVID-19. We found a significant difference in the CFR between the two groups of countries. Our data further supports the view that universal BCG vaccination has a protective effect on the course of COVID-19 probably preventing progression to severe disease and death. Clinical trials of BCG vaccine are urgently needed to establish its beneficial role in COVID-19 as suggested by the epidemiological data, especially in countries without a universal BCG vaccination policy.",

With more than one million confirmed cases and the global death toll alarmingly crossing 50,000 on April 3, there is a climate of fear, social disruption, institutional breakdown, and scientific uncertainty. The devastation caused by COVID-19 pandemic probably parallels the \"Spanish flu\" pandemic, still considered the most devastating in human history that affected an estimated one third of the world population at that time of which more than 2.5% died (1) . The world governments working in tandem with the health organisations are making all possible efforts to establish countermeasures to reduce the devastating effects of COVID-19. The world's top healthcare systems appear shaken and the pandemic has forced the medical fraternity to realise something very basic that life is not always in the doctors' hands, and to feel that being a doctor will never be the same after this pandemic (2) . Since there is no definitive treatment or an effective vaccine for disease control, the scientific community has been making frenetic efforts to find measures for cure or for at least reducing the morbidity due to . A large number of therapeutic measures such as low-dose methylprednisolone, chloroquine phosphate, hydroxychloroquine, ribavirin, angiotensin receptor 2 blockers, anti-ageing drugs such as azithromycin, quercetin, rapamycin and doxycycline, IL-1 or IL-1R suppressors, protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir, acetazolamide, nifedipine, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, convalescent plasma transfusions, tocilizumab, traditional Chinese medicine, statins, zinc supplements, and therapeutic neutralizing and monoclonal antibodies have been either tried or suggested for patients with COVID-19 over a short span of about 4 months in the desperate hope of an effective treatment of these patients (3) .

Another conclusion that the countries that established a universal BCG policy earlier had a reduced mortality rate is also reassuring especially for low and middle income economies. The other study by Hegarty PK et al, also arrived at a similar conclusion that countries with national program of universal BCG vaccination appear to have a lower incidence and death rate from COVID-19 (7) . Both studies recommend further testing of the hypothesis that BCG vaccine probably offers protection against COVID-19, through randomized controlled trials to determine how fast a BCG induced protective immune response to COVID-19 develops.",

Based on the hypothesis that BCG vaccination may induce (partial) protection against susceptibility to and/or severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection even during the epidemic, some countries like Australia and the Netherlands which do not practice routine BCG vaccination have been really quick to launch phase 3 clinical trials (12, 13).",

We chose this calculation as both the numerator and denominator were rapidly changing and the use was meant only for comparison and not for projecting the mortality due to COVID-19. We also wish to caution against oversimplification of interpretation of BCG vaccination link with COVID-19 as this is derived from the epidemiological data that needs to be confirmed by well designed clinical trials. Furthermore, the CFR depends on multiple factors, in particular, on the ability of the national governments and the healthcare systems to respond to the epidemic. As COVID-19 gains further foothold in low resource countries, the CFR may change significantly and the current conclusions may then become invalid.",

In another unprecedented development, hundreds of scientists, physicians, funders, and policy makers from all the major continents of the world have come together to form the COVID-19 Clinical Research Coalition to support WHO's efforts to counter the COVID-19 pandemic (5). It is in this context that the two recently published epidemiological studies by Miller A et al and Hegarty PK et al, on a correlation between universal Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination policy and reduced morbidity and mortality for COVID-19, offer a ray of hope for low resource countries (6, 7).",
