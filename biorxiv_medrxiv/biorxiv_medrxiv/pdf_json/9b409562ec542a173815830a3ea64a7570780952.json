The clinical manifestation of Covid-19 ranges from asymptomatic carrier status to severe pneumonia. Asymptomatic individuals in Covid-19 are those who are carriers of the virus but do not show clinical symptoms and are able to transmit the disease in the same degree as symptomatic carriers. In order to contain contagions is of supreme importance to identify asymptomatic patients because this subpopulation is one of the main factors contributing to the spread of this disease. We report on six Italian patients with COVID-19 who presented sudden hyposmia as the only or most prominent disease manifestation, without upper or lower respiratory tract involvement or other major features of the disease. A supra-threshold olfaction test confirmed the hyposmia in all patients.",

As of March 26, 2020, 533.416 cases with 24.082 deaths have been confirmed worldwide. Currently, United States, China, and Italy respectively are the countries with the highest number of cases 1 . In a study of 7,736 Covid-19 patients in China, of all the clinical symptoms, hyposmia was not reported in any patient 2 . We report on 6 subjects from Padua, Italy, who presented with hyposmia as the only or main manifestation of Covid-19. All patients were considered as \"healthy people\" before they were screened because of close contact with a lab-confirmed case of Covid-19. None of the patients reported acute, chronic or seasonal upper airway disease before infection, in one case a four-day fever was present after the onset of hyposmia; two patients reported myalgia the day before the onset of hyposmia and a mild dry cough after the hyposmia. Since olfactory disorders have a significant impact on taste, hypogeusia was reported in almost all cases 3 . This study was approved by the local ethics committee and all subjects gave informed consent to participate in the study.",
