            "text": "When emerging pathogens encounter new host species for which they are poorly adapted, they must evolve to escape extinction. Pathogens experience selection on traits at multiple scales, including replication rates within host individuals and transmissibility between hosts. We analyze a stochastic model linking pathogen growth and competition within individuals to transmission between individuals. Our analysis reveals a new factor, the cross-scale reproductive number of a mutant virion, that quantifies how quickly mutant strains increase in frequency when they initially appear in the infected host population. This cross-scale reproductive number combines with viral mutation rates, single-strain reproductive numbers, and transmission bottleneck width to determine the likelihood of evolutionary emergence, and whether evolution occurs swiftly or gradually within chains of transmission. We find that wider transmission bottlenecks facilitate emergence of pathogens with short-term infections, but hinder emergence of pathogens exhibiting cross-scale selective conflict and long-term infections. Our results provide a framework to advance the integration of laboratory, clinical and field data in the context of evolutionary theory, laying the foundation for a new generation of evidence-based risk assessment of emergence threats.",

For most pathogens, and certainly for RNA viruses and single-stranded DNA viruses, individual hosts often are not dominated by single pathogen genotypes [18, 19] . Furthermore, at the host population scale, pathogen allele frequencies at a given locus exhibit a range of dynamics from rapid selective sweeps for drug resistance or immune escape [20] [21] [22] to gradually changing frequencies [23, 24] . Together, these observations lead to the long-standing question of whether adaptive evolution of viruses occurs within single hosts by rapid fixation of beneficial mutants, or more slowly by a gradual shift of allele frequencies along chains of transmission [25, 26] . A recent wave of studies tracking changes in within-host genetic diversity through chains of transmission among hosts [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] provide unique opportunities to address this question, but a theoretical framework is needed.",

The existence of transmission bottlenecks has long been recognized, and is hypothesized to play a critical role in pathogen evolution [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Recent studies have reported that bottleneck widths vary considerably among pathogens and routes of transmission [41, 42], and perhaps across different phases of host adaptation [43]. Narrow transmission bottleneck sizes of 1 to 2 viral genotypes are common for HIV-1 [44-46] and hepatitis C virus [47, 48], and bottlenecks of 1 to 3 viruses are reported for influenza in ferret respiratory droplet transmission experiments [41, 42, 49] and in some studies of natural human transmission [50, 51]. Much wider bottleneck estimates, of 30 to over 100 viruses, have been reported for natural transmission of influenza in horses [29] and swine [52]; for ferret transmission experiments via direct contact [41, 42]; and for transmission of Ebola virus among All rights reserved.

This can arise as a strong selection bias at the transmission bottleneck, where strains present at low or undetectable frequencies in the donor host are preferentially transmitted to the recipient [43, 49, 57, 58] , or it can be measured directly via experimental infection and transmission studies [24, 59-61] (though we emphasize that enhanced transmissibility is not inevitable, and depends on availability of suitable adaptive genotypes [62] ). Overall transmission rates can be viewed as being determined by total viral loads, weighted by genotype-specific transmissibilities [58] . Importantly, the transmissibility trait can vary independently from viral replication fitness within hosts, so there is potential for conflicts in selection across scales. Indeed, there is clear evidence that HIV-1 has certain genotypes that transmit more efficiently, but then the within-host population tends to evolve toward lower-transmission strains during an infection [46, 58, [63] [64] [65] ; a similar phenomenon has been reported for H5N1 influenza [49] and H9N2 influenza [66] . In an extreme example, Plasmodium parasites were found to rapidly evolve resistance to an antimalarial drug, but at the cost of complete loss of transmissibility [67] . Experimental evolution studies have highlighted how antagonistic pleiotropy can lead to tradeoffs between viral replication and the extracellular survival that is required for transmission [68, 69] , and a similar tradeoff has been postulated for environmental transmission of avian influenza in the field [70] . Together these findings contribute to a growing evidence base that cross-scale conflicts in selection may inhibit the emergence of new viral strains in many systems [reviewed in 15].",

Our analysis allows us to address several fundamental questions about the emergence of novel pathogens: What factors limit evolutionary emergence for pathogens with different life histories? Why do some apparently 'nearby' adaptive mutants fail to emerge? How do bottleneck sizes influence the likelihood of emergence? Do evolutionary changes occur swiftly within individual hosts, or gradually across chains of transmission? Moreover, our analysis allows us to examine the relative importance of genetic diversity in zoonotic reservoirs versus the acquisition of new mutations following spillover into humans [76] [77] [78] . Specifically, we address the long-standing question of how much emergence risk is increased if the \"spillover inoculum\" includes some genotypes bearing adaptive mutations for the novel host? Finally, our analysis enables us to unify findings from previous theoretical studies, and propose mechanistic interpretations of phenomenological parameters from earlier work.",

Nearly all of these emergence events involve pathogens that are exposed to novel environments such as zoonotic pathogens entering human populations from non-human animal reservoirs, or human pathogens exposed to antimicrobial drugs [1] . In these novel environments, pathogens may experience new selective forces acting at multiple biological scales, leading to reduced replication rates within hosts or less efficient transmission between hosts. When these novel environments are sufficiently harsh, emergence only occurs when the pathogen adapts sufficiently quickly to avoid extinction. As genetic sequencing of pathogens becomes increasingly widespread, there are clear signs of such rapid adaptation [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , but we lack a cohesive framework to understand how this process might work across scales. Theoretical studies have shed important insights into circumstances under which this evolutionary emergence is possible, but either have focused on the host-to-host transmission dynamics and treated within-host dynamics only implicitly [12] [13] [14] [15] , or have accounted for explicit within-host dynamics only along a fixed transmission chain [16, 17] . Here, we introduce and analyze a model explicitly linking these two biological scales and demonstrate how within-host viral competition, infection duration, transmission dynamics within a host population, and the size of transmission bottlenecks determine the likelihood of evolutionary emergence. This analysis sheds new light on factors governing pathogen emergence, addresses long-standing questions about evolutionary aspects of emergence, and lays the foundation for making risk assessments which integrate outcomes from in vitro and in vivo experiments with findings from sequence-based surveillance in the field. wild-type maladapted for the novel environment and a mutant strain potentially adapted for the novel environment. The cross-scale model with explicit within-host dynamics. Formally, the cross-scale model is a continuous time, age-dependent, multi-type branching process [79, 80] . The \"type\" of individual corresponds to the composition of the initial virus population (i.e. the founding viral population that initiates the infection), and the \"age\" of an individual corresponds to the time since their initial infection. Within an infected host, the viral dynamics determine how the viral load and viral composition change over time due to competition between strains and mutation events. Transmission events are determined by the viral load and composition of the host and, consequently, are age-dependent. Below, we describe the model at each scale and the biological processes we consider in detail. The mean-field analogue of our model is an age-structured partial differential equation model introduced by Coombs et al. [73] .",

This local spread involves a small number of viruses, their infection of host cells at the exposure interface and possibly the innate immune response to infection [81, 82] . During this period, infection is stochastic and establishment of infection is not guaranteed [82, 83] . When one or more virions survive the period of initial local spread, they establish lineages that comprise the productive infection. These virions are termed as transmitted founder viruses [44] . Here, we explicitly define the number of transmitted founder viruses that establish productive infection as the bottleneck width N . This quantity can be estimated using viral genetic sequencing data, for example in [44, 55] . Our within-host model starts with the transmitted founder viruses by assuming an initial viral load N , and hence considers the period of established productive infection only (as with other within-host models [84, 85] and cross-scale deterministic models [73] ). The initial viral exposure and stochastic local infection process are implicitly incorporated into the transmission term in the population scale model as described below, and consequently, we consider a successful transmission event as a transmission event leading to an established infection.",

The wild-type and mutant strains increase exponentially at rates, r w and r m , respectively. These dynamics are consistent with the viral dynamics predicted by standard multistrain within-host models when target cells are abundant [86] [87] [88] . The viral load saturates at time T e with a maximal viral load K (Fig 1B) . We assume that after T e , the viral population size stays constant at K, and the frequencies of the wild-type and the mutant change due to their fitness differences. We further assume that the infectious period starts when v w (t) + v m (t) > 0 and ends after T days. For some acute infections, viral load usually decreases rapidly after viral peak (e.g., influenza A infections [89] ), and thus T is close to T e . For other acute infections, such as SARS-CoV-2 [90] infection, viral load remains at a high level after peak viremia for a longer period of time, in the range of weeks. In this case, T > T e . For chronic infections (though our work does not necessarily consider the full range of evolutionary processes involved in chronic infections) such as HIV and Hepatitis C [91] infections, viral loads usually reach a set-point and can stay roughly constant for an extended period of time, in the range of years. In this case, T is much greater than T e . Overall, this within-host model serves as a flexible framework to describe a range of viral dynamics from both acute and chronic infections, while maintaining simplicity to enable analysis.",

For an individual initially infected only with the wild-type strain, I w\u2192m equals the product of the contact rate, the infection duration, and the likelihood that a mutant virion is transmitted during a contact event, averaged over the full course of infection (Appendix). The likelihood of transmitting mutant virions on the t th day of infection is proportional to the product of the transmission bottleneck width (N ), the within-host frequency of the mutant strain, and the transmissibility b m of the mutant strain. This highlights an important distinction between short-term and long-term infections. For short-term infections where sT is small, there is insufficient time for the frequency of mutants to rise within a host, so transmission events with mutant virions are rare (< 1/1, 000 for all black contour lines in Fig 2A,B ). This is a key obstacle to evolutionary emergence in short-term infections. In contrast, for long-term infections where the mutant strain has a substantial within-host selective advantage, the mutant strain is transmitted frequently (e.g. the expected number of events > 1 for some contours in Fig 2C,D) .",

Our work identifies four steps to evolutionary emergence summarized in Figure 5 and four ingredients (see, equation (4)) that govern these steps: (i) the reproductive number of the wild type which determines the size of a minor outbreak of this strain, (ii) the rate at which individuals infected initially with the wild-type strain transmit the mutant strain, and (iii) the cross-scale reproductive number \u03b1 of a mutant virion which corresponds to the mean number of mutant virions transmitted by an individual whose initial infection only included one mutant virion, and (iv) the reproductive number of the mutant strain. Prior studies of evolutionary emergence [12] [13] [14] [15] identified the importance of the single strain reproductive numbers, R m and R w , and a phenomenological 'mutation rate', but ingredients (iii)-(iv) are new mechanistic insights arising from the cross-scale dynamics. By analyzing these ingredients of evolutionary emergence, we show how the probability of emergence is governed by selection pressures at within-host and between-host scales, the width of the transmission bottleneck, and the infection duration. We also map the conditions under which different broad-scale patterns are observed, from rapid selective sweeps to slower diffusion of new types. While our study has focused on within-host and between-host scales of selection, it could be generalized readily to other types of cross-scale dynamics where selection may act differently at different scales, such as within-farm and between-farm scales where genetic data have given insights into the emergence of high-pathogenicity avian influenza strains [93] .",

This quantity, which is approximated by the black contours in Fig 2, is governed chiefly by the ability of the mutant strain to reach an appreciable frequency within the host over the course of an infection. This is evident from the strong dependence on the strength of within-host selection-which surprisingly is much stronger than the dependence on the transmission advantage of mutant virions-and the higher values found for larger bottleneck widths, which favor transmission of low-frequency mutants through a straight-forward sampling effect. This sampling effect is consistent with the theoretical work of Geoghegan et al. [17] , and the experimental study of Frise et al. [42] , who found larger bottlenecks increased the likelihood of mutant viral strains being transmitted between hosts. The duration of infection plays a crucial role, and our analysis showed that achieving this first transmission of the adaptive mutant is a key barrier to evolutionary emergence for short-term infections (Fig 2A,B) . This finding aligns with the recent observation that putative immune-escape mutants of pandemic H1N1 influenza, which should have a within-host fitness advantage, were generated readily in infected humans but did not reach high within-host frequency and have been detected very rarely at the consensus level All rights reserved.

Even after the mutant strain has been transmitted, it needs to increase in frequency at the scale of the infected host population (Step 4 in Fig 5) . Specifically, each transmitted mutant virion, on average, needs to replace itself with more than one transmitted mutant virion in the next generation of infected hosts. When this occurs, it sets up a positive feedback along chains of infections: individuals with a higher frequency of the mutant strain tend to infect more individuals, which in turn provides more opportunities to transmit, on average, higher frequencies of the mutant strain to the next generation. Conversely, when this between-generation cross-scale reproductive number \u03b1 is less than one, the positive feedback leads to lower and lower frequencies of the mutant strain within the infected host population. This positive feedback mechanism is stronger for wider transmission bottlenecks (\u2265 5 virions in our numerical explorations), which better preserve the mutant frequency from one host to the next. Interestingly, this 5 virion threshold to define a wider transmission bottleneck is consistent with an earlier modeling study, which found that bottleneck sizes above 5 virions eliminated fitness losses in serial transfers of RNA viruses between cell culture plates [40] .",

For long-term infections, mutant frequencies can drop deterministically within a host, and hence prevent emergence, even if the mutant strain has a reproductive number greater than one. This occurs when the mutant strain has a within-host selective disadvantage and between-host selective advantage (upper left quadrant of Fig 2D) ; the long infectious period allows time for the within-host disadvantage to drive the mutant strain to lower frequency and, thereby, set up the positive feedback effectively preventing evolutionary emergence. In contrast, for short-term infections the mutant strain tends to rise in frequency whenever the mutant reproductive number is greater than one, because there is insufficient time for any within-host disadvantage to act. In particular, evolutionary emergence may occur despite within-host selective disadvantages, a possibility excluded by previous theory [15] . Collectively these two results imply that, in the face of cross-scale conflict and wide transmission bottlenecks, longer infectious periods can inhibit, rather than facilitate [14] , evolutionary emergence (Fig 2B,D) . Related to this result, Geoghegan et al. [17] found that longer durations of the infectious period would lower the probability that a donor would infect the recipient. In their case, this occurred because fitness of the mutant was assumed to be lower in the donor host species and higher in the recipient species. Hence, a longer infectious period could purge any mutants arising in the donor and result in the recipient only receiving wild-type virions.",

In both cases, the answer depends on the cross-scale reproductive number \u03b1 of a mutant virion that governs the frequency feedback. Under most circumstances, wider bottlenecks boost the probability of emergence (Fig 4A,B) , because they favor the onward transmission of mutant virions when they are rare; this is particularly vital for the first transmission of mutant virions (i.e. Step 3 in Fig. 5 ). The exception is for long-term infections with \u03b1 < 1, such that the mutant tends to decline in frequency in the infected host population. Under these circumstances, wider bottlenecks hinder emergence by propagating reductions in the frequency of the mutant strain more efficiently from host to host (Step 4 in Fig. 5 ). Conventional thinking about the influence of bottlenecks on viral adaptation emphasizes fitness losses due to genetic drift and the effects of Muller's ratchet [35-37, 39, 40] , which become more severe for narrower bottlenecks. Contrary to these negative effects of narrow bottlenecks, our findings highlight that narrower bottlenecks can aid emergence in long-term infections with a cross-scale conflict in selection (Fig 4B) . Here the adaptive gain in transmissibility at population scales can be impeded by the selective disadvantage at the within-host scale, but, intriguingly, this disadvantage is neutralized by genetic drift arising from narrow bottlenecks. Given the evidence for cross-scale evolutionary conflicts for HIV-1 [58, 63, 64, 96] , our results suggest the possibility that HIV-1's narrow transmission bottleneck [44] could play a role in the emergence of novel strains (e.g. drug resistant strains).",

If the cross-scale reproductive number \u03b1 of a mutant virion is greater than one, so that the mutant frequency rises easily in the infected host population, then even low frequencies of mutants in the reservoir lead to substantial risk of emergence. Indeed, for long-term infections with \u03b1 > 1, emergence becomes almost certain when there are mutants in the initial spillover inoculum. Conversely, when the cross-scale reproductive number \u03b1 is less than one, emergence probability scales with the proportion of mutants in the initial dose, and when \u03b1 1, the initial dose must consist almost entirely of the mutant strain in order to pose any major risk. These findings yield direct lessons for the growing enterprise of conducting genetic surveillance on zoonotic pathogens in their animal reservoirs [97] [98] [99] [100] . A crucial requirement for effective genetic surveillance is the ability to identify genotypes of concern; the integration of various research approaches to address this question, and estimate key quantities, is an on-going research challenge [101] [102] [103] . Risk to humans increases if there is any non-zero proportion of mutant viruses in the spillover inoculum, so tracking the presence of such mutants is beneficial.

            "text": "While there are not sufficient data from past emergence events to test our model's conclusions, recent studies combining animal transmission experiments with deep sequencing have exhibited many phenomena aligned with our findings. Moncla et al. [43] conducted deep sequencing analyses of H1N1 influenza viruses, in the context of ferret airborne transmission experiments that examined the adaptation of avian-like viruses to the mammalian host. Their results provide in-depth insights into selection within hosts and at transmission bottlenecks, for a range of mutations on genetic backgrounds that change as adaptation proceeds (i.e. equivalent to numerous separate implementations of our model of a single mutational step). They observe a fascinating range of dynamics: some mutations appeared to have \u03b1 moderately above 1, exhibiting modest increases in frequency between generations, but achieved this outcome with different traits (e.g. S113N on the HA190D225D background exhibited strong within-host selection and no evident transmission advantage, while D265V showed weak within-host selection but its frequency rises in transmission). Another mutation (I187T on the 'Mut' background) appeared to have \u03b1 1 and exhibited strong selection at both scales; notably, this mutation is widespread in 17/17 human-derived isolates of the post-emergence 1918 virus, consistent with the successful and rapid emergence our model would predict. Moncla et al. also present substantial evidence of cross-scale conflict in selection, as one mutation (G225D on 'Mut' background) exhibited declining frequencies within ferrets but rose to fixation in 2/2 transmission events, while numerous mutations in the HA2 region rose in frequency within the host but were eliminated in transmission. Another study examined a set of 'gain-of-function' mutations in H5N1 influenza in ferrets, and reported a slow rise in frequency when the virus was passaged between ferrets by intranasal inoculation, then rapid fixation of these mutations during airborne transmission [24] ; the airborne transmission data are consistent with strong between-host selection and a high \u03b1 value (though we emphasize that circulating H5N1 viruses required substantial modification to the favorable genetic background used in those experiments). Intriguingly, Moncla et al. synthesized their results with those of earlier studies [41, 49, 62] to hypothesize that the 'stringency' of the transmission bottleneck varies systematically during the course of viral adaptation, with loose bottlenecks prevailing when viruses first encounter a new host species (and perhaps again when the virus is host-adapted), and much tighter bottlenecks at the key juncture in host adaptation when a genotype with greater transmissibility is available to be selected. If this hypothesis is correct, then our findings can be applied to each adaptive step independently, and may help to identify which viral traits are most crucial to adaptive steps subject to tighter or looser bottlenecks.",

A within-host fitness valley in replication rates would hinder pathogens with long-term infections and larger bottleneck widths, more than those with smaller bottlenecks. A between-host fitness valley in transmissibility could hinder evolutionary emergence of pathogens causing long-term infections more than those causing short-term infections, unless the within-host landscape is sufficiently favorable to allow traversing the valley within a single host's long-term infection.

This simplification allows us to study how evolutionary emergence is limited by different factors for pathogens dominated by exponential versus saturated phases of viral growth, while maintaining analytical tractability. Future important extensions would be to allow within-host fitness to alter the carrying capacity in the saturated phase, as well as identifying the relative contributions of stochastic within-host dynamics [17] , immune responses, and host heterogeneity on viral emergence. Some of these aims would be addressed by using a more mechanistic model for the within-host dynamics, incorporating resource limitation [72, 73] or immune pressure [107] . We have assumed that the bottleneck width N is fixed for a given pathogen. This is broadly consistent with currently available data [44, 47, 48] , but it will be important to explore the consequences of variation in bottleneck width arising from different routes of transmission, or possibly from changing viral loads [38, 39] . Among other possible impacts, this may alter the conclusion that emergence probability is minimally affected by the functional dependence of transmission probability on viral load. The computational and analytical framework developed here can be extended to account for these additional complexities. Other important extensions can explore the impact of clonal competition on emergence probabilities [108] [109] [110] [111] or the potential for complementation to rescue pathogen strains from deep fitness valleys-a mechanism that depends on wide transmission bottlenecks [112] .",

Therefore, most of the dependence of b w N/(N \u2212 1) T 0 min{K, (N \u2212 1) exp(r w t)}f (t, N )dt with N stems from the dependence of f (t, N ) with N . Since a \u2192 a/(1 + a) is an increasing function bounded above by 1 for positive a, the expression exp(\u03c4 + st)/(N \u2212 1)/(1 + exp(\u03c4 + st)/(N \u2212 1)) decreases when N increases. As N \u2192 (a/(1 + a)) N \u22121 is a decreasing function of N \u2265 1 for a > 0, we get that the probability of emergence decreases at least exponentially with the bottleneck size, as claimed in the main text. Fig Appendix-1 illustrates that these approximations work especially when s is sufficiently negative.",

Mutations ensure individuals typically have a mixed infection with wild-type (blue) and mutant (red) viral strains (panel B). The likelihood of transmission between individuals, and the composition of the infecting dose (panel C), depend on the size and composition of the infected individual's viral load at the time of contact, and on the transmissibility of each strain. As the infection spreads in the population (panel A), the frequency of the mutant virions among infected individuals varies (panel D) and, ultimately, determines whether evolutionary emergence occurs.

These expressions for the single strain reproductive numbers are equivalent to evaluating the integral presented in equation (22) of Coombs et al. [73] for our within-host model.

Then provided s is sufficiently small to ensure that the mutant type doesn't saturate, R i are given by (A-1). The log ratio, provided exp(which yields (2) in the main text.
