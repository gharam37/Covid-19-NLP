            "text": "Background: Emergence of COVID-19 caught the world off-guard and unprepared, initiating a global pandemic. In the absence of evidence, individual communities had to take timely action to reduce the rate of disease spread and avoid overburdening their healthcare systems. Although a few predictive models have been published to guide these decisions, most have not taken into account spatial differences and have included assumptions that do not match the local realities. Access to reliable information that is adapted to local context is critical for policymakers to make informed decisions during a rapidly evolving pandemic. Objective: The goal of this study was to develop an adapted susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to predict the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina and the Charlotte metropolitan region and to incorporate the effect of a public health intervention to reduce disease spread, while accounting for unique regional features and imperfect detection. Methods: Three SIR models were fit to prevalence data from the state and the greater Charlotte region and then rigorously compared. One of these models (SIR-Int) accounted for a stay-at-home intervention and imperfect detection of COVID-19 cases. Results: Presently, the COVID-19 outbreak is rapidly decelerating in NC and the Charlotte region. Infection curves are flattening at both the state and regional level. Relatively speaking, the greater Charlotte region has responded more favorably to the stay-at-home intervention than NC as a whole. While an initial basic SIR model served the purpose of informing decision making in the early days of the pandemic, its forecast increasingly did not fit the data over time. However, as the pandemic and local conditions evolved, the SIR-Int model provided a good fit to the data. Conclusions: Using local data and continuous attention to model adaptation, our findings have enabled policymakers, public health officials and health systems to do capacity planning and evaluate the impact of a public health intervention. Our SIR-Int model for estimated latent prevalence was reasonably flexible, highly accurate, and demonstrated the efficacy of a stayat-home order at both the state and regional level. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating local context into pandemic forecast modeling, as well as the need to remain vigilant and informed by the data as we enter into a critical period of the outbreak.",

These critical policy decisions must be implemented quickly and evaluated continuously so they can be adapted to the local context, recognizing the clear effect that geography, community context, density and social determinants of health have on COVID-19 outcomes. In North Carolina (NC), the first COVID-19 case was reported on March 2, 2020, and cases increased to 3,963 total confirmed cases as of April 10 [12] . To slow the rapidly increasing transmission rate, within a few weeks after the 1st case was detected, NC state officials promoted social distancing strategies (i.e., deliberately increasing physical space), banned large social gatherings, and closed public schools and universities. Subsequently, a stay-at-home order, which only allows for essential travel outside the home, was issued in the southwestern part of the state by Mecklenburg County effective at 8 am March 26, lasting through April 16 (since extended to April 29) , while a statewide stay-at-home order was issued effective at 5 pm March 30, lasting to April 29.",

Forecasting models are used to generate early warnings to identify how a pandemic might evolve. During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, forecasting was frequently applied to predict national and international infection transmission trends [13, 14] . Local communities and health systems turned to these national and international models for their own planning; however, the generalizability of such models to the local situation is limited and ignores important community-level population characteristics and transmission dynamics [3, 15, 16, 17] . An objective of this study was to understand how spatial differences impact model results and their interpretation.",

In this study, we present an initial Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemic model and its evolution to the Susceptible-Infected-Removed-Social Distancing-Detection Rate (SIR-Int) model. Here we describe and compare these models, the spatial differences in a pandemic, the significance of observed cases versus actual prevalence in the setting of rapidly evolving testing strategies, the current epidemiological trends and the potential effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions applied locally (e.g., social distancing). We also offer recommendations for how community and health system leaders may interpret our models to better prepare and act to decrease the negative consequences of COVID-19 spread within their own communities.",

Next, cumulative deaths were subtracted from adjusted cumulative cases. We also adjusted cumulative cases for recoveries by removing cases after 20 days, the estimated median duration of viral shedding from illness onset [23] . Daily incremental incidence was obtained by subtracting the estimated latent prevalence at time t \u2212 1 from that at time t.

In both plots, we see the dramatic effect of the public health intervention; that is, the so-called \"flattening of the curve\". There are two important differences to note between NC and the CRI region. First, the CRI visibly shows relatively more flattening. This effect can be best observed in Table 3 in the Peak % Infected and Final % Infected columns. Moving from the Pre to Post to Int models within a location, the drop in percentage infected is more pronounced in the CRI. In fact, for the SIR-Int model, the percentages are virtually the same for both locations; that is, the CRI has \"slowed down\" to the state as a whole. Second, the date of peak prevalence was initially 8 days earlier for the CRI compared to NC. However, using the current SIR-Int model, although both locations showed their infection curves shifting forward in time, the date of peak prevalence is now 3 days later in the CRI (Table 3 ). To put this into context, for NC, the time duration from the start of the outbreak to the peak prevalence has gone from 49 days to 70 days (43% increase). However, for the CRI, the time duration from the start of the outbreak to the peak prevalence has gone from 32 days to 64 days (100% increase).",

Beyond that, a basic SIR model, especially one that is used after being fit only to early pandemic data, imparts no further value for informing pandemic response planning, and indeed may provide errant forecasts.

This could be attributed to the fact that the CRI contains the largest city in NC, and one of the US's busiest airports, setting the stage for this region to have become another COVID-19 hotspot. It is interesting to note that the NC SIR-Int model showed a better fit when the changepoint was also set to March 26, rather than March 30 when the statewide stay-at-home order went into place. One possible explanation for this could be that as the pandemic began in earnest, the general population's fear of the virus also increased, perhaps causing most NC citizens to shelter-in-place prior to the order going into effect. Another explanation is that Mecklenburg County accounts for almost 11% of the NC population and so the effect of the county order directly impacted adjoining counties in the CRI, thus influencing the observed effect at the state level. Two additional interesting observations highlight the critical influence of spatial variation. First, the CRI infection curve evidences relatively more flattening and a later peak infection date ( Figure 7, Figure 8 , Table  3 ). Second, the intervention effect in the CRI also appears stronger ( Table 2 ). The likely explanations for these differences are the Mecklenburg County stay-at-home policy going into effect five days before the state order, the different reaction of the local population to the order and its related messaging, and innumerable other unknown covariates such as early canceling of religious services, public gathering policies, and canceling of elective medical visits and procedures.",

It is also possible to customize the SIR model within R to define more advanced and different transition processes, and then parameterize and simulate those models. The SIR model is simple to understand and easier to fit, as opposed to other deterministic compartmental models (e.g., SEIR) or stochastic individual contact models [31] .

Data sources are known to undercount cases, only including asymptomatic illness by chance, and to define cases inconsistently, based on variable testing criteria, between and within geographies. Collectively, these contribute to imperfect detection. As a result, high-level models may not comprehend the full extent of the outbreak, creating challenges in producing accurate forecasts. Our decision to base our modeling strategy on estimated latent prevalence addresses this inconsistency by adjusting observed prevalence counts. Modeling only the observed prevalence has the effect of shifting the SIR curves ahead in time by several days or more. While our estimate of the detection probability (0.14) is heuristically motivated, a thorough search of the literature supports our use of this estimate as reasonable. Future work will focus on refining this estimate as new research appears and to allow it to vary as a function of time.",

We note that our mid-May date for the peak infection curve is roughly 3-to-4 weeks later than the projection from the often-cited model from The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation [34] . The later uses a Bayesian generalized nonlinear mixed model to examine cumulative death rates and assumes a strict social distancing policy is in place. Using data up until March 13, Columbia University reported a mid-May peak time for NC under no control measures and a start of July peak time under some control measures [35] . The authors caution that their metapopulation SEIR model is designed to capture national trends, and local projections should be viewed as broad estimates. Other models, such as the CHIME model from the University of Pennsylvania Health System, relied on data from three Pennsylvania hospitals to estimate hospital capacity and clinical demand and was not designed to capture changing regional mitigation strategies [36] .",

All models should be continuously re-calibrated, and adapted to the rapid, continuously changing situations inherent to a pandemic. A one size fits all approach to the underpinning forecasting model or reliance on data that does not incorporate local context, sets the stage for misguided forecasting. Additionally, our study shows that while a classic SIR model may perform well in the early days of the pandemic, it begins to lose relevance with the emergence of additional influences like social distancing and enhanced awareness of personal hygiene.",

It is also possible that infection prevalence could oscillate at a low level over time, in which case more advanced modeling and methods would be needed. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating local context into pandemic forecast modeling, as well as the need to remain vigilant and informed by the data as we enter into a critical period of the outbreak.
