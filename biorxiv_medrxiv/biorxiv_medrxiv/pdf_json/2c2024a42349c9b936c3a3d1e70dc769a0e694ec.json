Targeting at this problem, this paper conducted a feasibility study by defining a mathematical model named SEMCR that can access effectiveness of mitigation, suppression and hybrid interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and Wuhan. It extended traditional SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model by adding two key features: a direct connection between Exposed and Recovered populations, and separating infections into mild and critical cases. It defined parameters to classify two stages of COVID-19 control: active contain by isolation of cases and contacts, passive contain by suppression or mitigation. The model was fitted and evaluated with public dataset containing daily number of confirmed active cases including Wuhan and London during January, 2020 and March 2020. The simulated results showed that 1) Immediate suppression taken in Wuhan significantly reduced the total exposed and infectious populations to 119610, but it has to be consistently maintained at least 90 days (by the middle of April 2020). Its success heavily relied on sufficiently external support from other places of China. This mode were not suitable to other countries that have no sufficient health resources. 2) In London, it is possible to take a hybrid intervention of suppression and mitigation for every 2 or 3 weeks over a longer period to balance the total infections and economic loss. While the total infectious populations in this scenario would be possibly 2 times than the one taking suppression, economic loss and recovery of London would be less affected. 3) Both in Wuhan and London cases, one important issue of fitting practical data was that there were a large portion (probably 62.9% in Wuhan) of self-recovered populations that were asymptomatic or mild symptomatic. These people might think they have been healthy at home and did not go to hospital for COVID-19 tests. Early release of intervention intensity potentially increased a risk of the second outbreak. One limitation of our model was that our prediction of infections and deaths depended on a parameter estimation of intervention intensity that presented by averagenumber contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals in a certain region. It assumed that each intervention had equivalent effects on the reproduction number R in different regions over time. Practical effectiveness of implementing intervention intensity might be varied with respect to cultures or other issues of certain county.",

Among a variety of factors leading to emergence and outbreaks of ID, the key issues are population density and human mobility where in these cities with developed transportation systems, pathogens can be spread to large geographic space within a short period of time. For instance, the ongoing global epidemic outbreak of COVID-19 has spread to at least 146 countries and territories on 6 continents in 2 months. In order to give an accurate prediction of outbreaks, many researchers have been working in traditional ID propagation models [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] like SIR, SEIR,.et.al, for understanding COVID-19 transmission with human mobility and predicting outbreak process of epidemics. Meanwhile, as realizing a long period of this battle against COVID-19, many of them recently focus on intervention strategies [8] [9] [10] that can balance a trade-off between limited human mobility and potential economic loss in COVID-19 control. It poses an important research area that explores how and when to take what level of interventions in light of multiple natures and capabilities of countries.",

            "text": "In traditional compartmental models paradigm in epidemiology, SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) [3] and SEIR (Susceptible -Exposure-Infectious-Recovered) [4] are two popular approaches to simulate and predict how infectious disease is transmitted from human to human. These two models have defined several variables that represent the number of people in each compartment at a particular time. As implied by the variable function of time, these models are dynamic to reflect the changes and fluctuations of these numbers in each compartment over time. For COVID-19 control in Wuhan, Zhong, et.al [6] introduced a modified SEIR model in prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in China, where the results showed that under strong suppression of \"lockdown Hubei\", the epidemic of COVID-19 in China would achieve peak by late February and gradually decline by the end of April 2020. Some other extended models [8] [12] are also proposed for predicting the epidemics of COVID-19 in Wuhan and give some similar forecasts. While above methods demonstrate good performance in prediction of COVID-19 outbreak by taking strong public intervention, also named as suppression strategy [13] that aims to reverse epidemic growth, one important challenge is that taking suppression strategy only is to treat disease controls as single-objective optimisation of reducing the overall infectious populations as soon as possible, and require strategic consistency in a long term. In real-world, taking public health intervention strategies is actually a multiple-objective optimisation problem including economic loss and society impacts. Thus, most countries have taken different intervention strategies, like enhanced surveillance and isolation to affected individuals in Singapore [14] , four-stage response plan of the UK [15] , mitigation approaches [13] and even multiple interventions taken in many EU countries. Due to the fact that standalone intervention strategy has apparent merits and limitations, it becomes highly necessary to study the feasibility of intervention strategies to certain country in light of its multiple natures and capabilities.",

Then, it defined parameters to classify two stages of COVID control: active contain by isolation of cases and contacts, passive contain by suppression or mitigation. The model was fitted and evaluated with public dataset containing daily number of confirmed active cases including Wuhan, London, Hubei province and the UK during January, 2020 and March 2020.

This group of populations might be self-recovered in some days, but will not realize they were infected. The second feature in our model is that we separate infectious population into mild and critical cases in light of their symptoms. It mainly concerns a phenomena of relatively higher mortality rate in the early outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan after taking immediate suppression intervention on 23 rd Jan 2020.

This implied that: 1) the total infectious population of these four cases would be 7.76 million in London, 12.27 million in Wuhan, 50.95 million in Hubei and 48.46 million in the UK. 2) The total death of these four cases would be 761 thousand in London, 120 thousand in Wuhan, 493 thousand in Hubei and 475 thousand in the UK. It equalled to about over 80% of total population of each region will be infectious, with the morality rate nearly 1%. It showed that without intervention, the outbreak of COVID-19 would lead to huge infections and deaths. The main reason was that COVID-19 was estimated as relatively high production number R0 up to 3 [14] , where the transmission ratio \u03b22 from Susceptible to Exposed is up to 78%. Thus, in some regions with high migration and dense population, it would easily lead to an outbreak.",

If there are no sufficient external support, it will be risky to take intensive suppression to entire country due to huge impacts on its economics. Also, taking such intensive intervention to control an epidemic will need to be maintained until vaccine released (up to 12 months or more).

We assume that each intervention has the same effect on the reproduction number in different regions over time. The practical effectiveness of implementing intervention intensity might be varied with respect to cultures or many other issues of certain county. As implementing hybrid intervention, the policy needs to be specific and well-estimated at each day according to the number of confirmed cases, deaths, morality ratio, health resources, etc.",

The model was fitted and evaluated with public dataset containing daily number of confirmed active cases including Wuhan, London, Hubei province and the UK. The experimental findings show that the optimal timing of interventions differs between suppression and mitigation strategies, as well as depending on the definition of optimal. In future, our model could be extended to investigate how to optimise the timing and strength of intervention to reduce COVID-19 morality and healthcare demand in mobile application.",
