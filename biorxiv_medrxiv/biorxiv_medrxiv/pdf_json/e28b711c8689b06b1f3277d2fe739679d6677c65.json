Efficient identification of subtypes is particularly important for tracking the 3 geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of infectious spread in real-time. In this paper, we utilize an 4 entropy analysis to identify nucleotide sites within SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences that are highly 5 informative of genetic variation, and thereby define an Informative Subtype Marker (ISM) for each sequence. 6 We further apply an error correction technique to the ISMs, for more robust subtype definition given 7 ambiguity and noise in sequence data. We show that, by analyzing the ISMs of global SARS-CoV-2 sequence 8 data, we can distinguish interregional differences in viral subtype distribution, and track the emergence of 9 subtypes in different regions over time. Based on publicly available data up to April 5, 2020, we show, for 10 example: (1) distinct genetic subtypes of infections in Europe, with earlier transmission linked to subtypes 11 prevalent in Italy with later development of subtypes specific to other countries over time;",

Our results demonstrate that utilizing ISMs for genetic subtyping can be an important complement to 16 conventional phylogenetic tree-based analyses of the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, because ISMs are 17 efficient and compact subtype identifiers, they will be useful for modeling, data-mining, and machine learning 18 tools to help enhance containment, therapeutic, and vaccine targeting strategies for fighting the COVID-19 19 pandemic. We have made the subtype identification pipeline described in this paper publicly available at 20 https://github.com/EESI/ISM. 21 Author Summary 22 The novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, expanded to reportedly 1.3 million confirmed 23 cases worldwide by April 7, 2020. The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlights the importance of tracking 24 dynamics of viral pandemics in real-time. Through the beginning of April 2020, researchers obtained genetic 25 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from nearly 4,000 infected individuals worldwide. Since the virus readily mutates, 26 each sequence of an infected individual contains useful information linked to the individual's exposure 27 location and sample date. But, there are over 30,000 bases in the full SARS-CoV-2 genome -so tracking 28 genetic variants on a whole-sequence basis becomes unwieldy. We describe a method to instead efficiently 29 identify and label genetic variants, or \"subtypes\" of SARS-CoV-2. Applying this method results in a 30 compact, 17 base-long label, called an Informative Subtype Marker or \"ISM.\" We define viral subtypes for 31 each ISM, and show how regional distribution of subtypes track the progress of the pandemic. Major findings 32 include (1) showing distinct viral subtypes of infections in Europe emanating from Italy to other countries 33 over time, and (2) tracking emergence of a local subtype across the United States connected to Asia and 34 distinct from the outbreak in New York, which is connected to Europe.",

All visualizations in this paper and our pipeline are 172 generated using Matplotlib [12] . To improve visualization, ISMs that occur with frequency of less than 5% in 173 a given location are collapsed into \"OTHER\" category per location. Our pipeline then creates pie charts for 174 different locations to show the geographical distribution of subtypes. Each subtype is also labeled with the 175 earliest date associated with sequences from a given location in the dataset. 176 To study the progression of SARS-CoV-2 viral subtypes in the time domain, we group all sequences in a given location that were obtained no later than a certain date (as provided in the sequence metadata) together and compute the relative abundance (i.e., frequency) of corresponding subtypes. Any subtypes with a relative abundance that never goes above 2.5% for any date are collapsed into \"OTHER\" category per location. The following formula illustrates this calculation:",

[32] Additionally, Table 2 shows a high-entropy, informative site in the predicted coding region ORF8. Based 237 on structural homology analysis the ORF8 region in SARS-CoV-2 does not have a known functional domain 238 or motif [5] . In previously characterized human SARS coronavirus, ORF8 has been associated with an 239 enhanced inflammatory response, but that sequence feature does not appear to have been conserved in 240 SARS-CoV-2, and, in general, SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 appears divergent from other previously characterized 241 SARS-related coronaviruses [5, 40] . Previous entropy-based analysis of earlier and smaller SARS-CoV-2 242 sequence data sets have suggested that there is a mutational hotspot in ORF8, including early divergence 243 between sequences found in China, and large scale deletions found in patients in Singapore -which is 244 consistent with the results we have found here on a much more comprehensive analysis of genomes [4, 28, 30] . 245 Similarly, sites were identified in the ORF3a reading frame, which also appears to have diverged 246 substantially from other SARS-related viruses. In particular, the SARS-CoV-2 variant in the predicted 247 ORF3 region appear also to not contain functional domains that were responsible for increased inflammatory 248 response as they were in those viruses [5, 40] .

As the plot shows, the outbreak in other European countries have generally 335 involved the same viral subtypes as those which are most abundant in Italy, as defined by ISM. Indeed, 336 initial reports of cases in various other European countries in late February 2020 were linked to travellers 337 from Italy [2] .

An additional observation to note from 6 is that the most 352 abundant subtype in Italy (TCGTCCACGGGTGGG) is found proportionately much more in France and Spain 353 than the second-most abundant subtype (TCGTCCACGGGTAAC), detected later. Conversely, the second-most 354 abundant subtype is found more uniformly in other countries. These observations give rise to two potential 355 hypotheses for further study: (1) An outbreak centered in Italy moved earlier to France and Spain, and cases 356 elsewhere are connected to a combination of earlier and later exposures. Or, (2) the second-most abundant 357 subtype in Italy is linked to potential exposure from another country in Europe. Overall, the foregoing 358 results are consistent with phylogenetic tree-based analyses, such as that illustrated on NextStrain's website 359 (http://www.nextstrain.org/ncov), which suggest a flow of the infection from Asia, to Italy, and then 360 subsequently export from Italy to other countries in Europe.

One potential explanation is that 451 because the SARS-CoV-2, is an RNA virus and thus highly susceptible to mutation as transmissions 452 occur [20] . Therefore, as transmissions have continued, the ISM associated with the reference sequence has 453 been replaced by different ISMs due to these mutations. Another plausible explanation for such leveling off 454 in a region is that the leveling off in relative abundance of the subtype represents containment of that 455 subtype's transmission while other subtypes continue to expand in that country or region. The latter could 456 plausibly explain the pattern observed in the United States, where earlier subtypes connected to Asia did not 457 increase in abundance while a putative endogenous subtype, as well as the dominant New York subtype, have 458 significantly increased in abundance (see Figure 8 and accompanying discussion above). Further investigation 459 and modeling of subtype distributions, as well as additional data, will be necessary to help resolve these questions -particularly in view of the caveats described below.",

As a result, even 464 though subtype CCCTGCCTGTAGGCGGG is first seen in the United States on February 20, 2020 and then a 465 sequence with that ISM was obtained in Canada sequences about 14 days later, that does not necessarily 466 mean that Canada acquired this subtype from the United States. While the presence or absence of this 467 subtype in sequences obtained from travelers may shed light on this question, it cannot be definitive because 468 so few cases due to travel have been sequenced. However, given the amount of time that has lapsed, the 469 general result that this subtype did not originate in Mainland China, for example, is more robust.",

We expect this to 491 occur, because as the number of transmissions of the virus between people increases over time, the 492 probability of changes to the sequence that will lead to a different ISM will increase. To evaluate the increase in ISM diversity, we computed the Hamming distance between each of the 50 494 most prevalent ISMs and the ISM of the reference sequence [13] . These distances, although na\u00efve as they are 495 based on an equally probably nucleotide changes, provide a rough measure of how much each ISM has 496 changed relative to the reference. We then plotted the distance of each ISM along the dates of the first 497 sequence in which the ISM was first detected. As Figure 15 illustrates, even though there is significant 498 variability in this rough measure of the difference between ISMs, there is a clearly accelerating trend towards 499 greater differences over time based on the sequence dates. This provides additional confidence in the 500 robustness of subtyping by ISM according to sequence date. By way of further illustrating this point, Figure 501 15 superimposes the cumulative reported number of confirmed COVID-19 cases over time. 6 While these data 502 provide only a limted picture of the actual number of SARS-CoV-2 infections (including because of limited 503 testing), it further demonstrates that ISM subtypes following sequence dates are capable of tracking the 504 actual temporal progress of the virus.",
