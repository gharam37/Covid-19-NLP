Substantial, non-discriminatory limitations have been imposed on air travel to inhibit this spread. As the disease prevalence and incidence will decrease, more specific control measures will be sought so that commercial air travel can continue to operate yet not impose a high threat of COVID-19 resurgence. Methods : We use modelled global air travel data and population density estimates to analyse the risk posed by 1364 airports to initiate a COVID-19 outbreak. We calculate the risk using a probabilistic approach that considers the volume of air travelers between airports and the of each location, scaled by population density. This R 0 exercise is performed globally as well as specifically for two potentially vulnerable locations: Africa and India.",

On March 11, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic [2] ; i.e. it is now deemed to be on a global scale, with significant autochthonous transmission in different countries. The implications of such a declaration can have is that tackling the COVID-19 pandemic might require international coordination and collaboration [3] . Up to date, COVID-19 cases have been observed in over 100 territories, in all inhabited continents [4] . Such a pervasive spread is partly a consequence of the innate transmissibility of the virus, which is expressed by the relatively high basic reproductive number point estimates ranging from 1.4 to as high as 6.5 (with uncertainty bounds providing an even wider range) [5] , [6] . However, an additional prominent reason for the especially wide and rapid spread of COVID-19 is likely to be the current high prevalence of international travel.",

These have spurred the applications of various outbreak control measures regarding air travel, including quarantining individuals returning via air travel from specific countries, or regardless of their departure locations [9] . Consequently, many flights have been cancelled, causing sharp decreases in flight volumes [8] . Such outbreak control measures are non-selective, and are hence costly, inconvenient and substantially hamper general international travel. As such, they might be resorted to mostly when other epidemic control options are not available.",

Risk assessments of scenarios of COVID-19 spread to new locations, or retrospective analysis or importation to certain locations, have been previously performed [10] - [14] . These studies mainly focused on the introduction of COVID-19 into highly vulnerable locations, often with public health infrastructures that may not respond efficiently to contain an outbreak. On the other hand, locations can also be determined as dangerous by their likelihood to disseminate infected individuals and initiate novel or reoccurring COVID-19 outbreaks in other locations. Investing additional resources in individual screening at locations defined as dangerous in this sense might therefore prove efficient in preventing spillover from countries which do not completely cancel international flights. In addition to being currently relevant, such a strategy might also be important when SARS-CoV-2 is suppressed to low-frequency or even undetectable circulation. Under this scenario, narrower public health interventions would be needed, and increased focus would be pointed at preventing new or recurrent outbreaks.",

Then, an average of a 30km edged square centered at said maximum was calculated. This heuristic of density estimation is meant to approximate the density of a major nearby location to which an infected passenger is likely to arrive. For example, our heuristic method found the maximal density location of JFK, EWR and LGA (three major airports serving New York City) to be located in downtown Manhattan. Similarly, the two airports serving Berlin (TXL, SXF) and two airports serving Tokyo (NRT, HND) were correctly assigned the same maximal population density in their corresponding metropolitans.",

That is, every airport is assigned a risk of initiating an outbreak in any location, according to the ariport's flight patterns and the destination's risk of outbreak. First, we observe the strong connectivity clusters focused in Europe, east Asia, and the United States (Figure 1.a) . We further note that risk is high in east Asia with all but two of the top ten highest-risk airports originating in that region (the exceptions being London Heathrow and Dubai airport; Figure 1 ). Calculating the average risk of the ten highest-risk airports in each continent yields the following risk order: Asia (0.51), Europe (0.28), North America (0.23), South America (0.14), Africa (0.06), and Oceania (0.04).",

Africa is relatively disconnected from the rest of the world. Its strongest connections to locations outside the continent include connection to central Europe, with a relatively strong connectivity to France (mainly through Morocco), England, and the Arab peninsula (Figure 2 .a). The risk posed by different airports to initiate a COVID-19 outbreak in Africa is highest at Johannesburg, Paris, Dubai, London, Abuja (Nigeria), Jedda (Saudi Arabia), Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Cairo and Istanbul (Figure 2.b) . Contrary to Africa, in India we do observe the largest risk to initiate an outbreak arising from domestic flights, originating within India itself. Of the ten highest-risk airports with respect to India, eight are within the borders of India (the exceptions being airports in Dubai and Singapore). The same trend continues in the following twenty highest-risk airports -fifteen of the top twenty are in India. We further investigated the seasonal changes in the connectivity between airports.

On the other hand, Shanghai Hongqiao airport, ranked 17th, has a risk estimate which is lower by a factor of 2. The variability is even more extreme when we consider only the risk to initiate an outbreak in Africa. This risk is halved between the top ranked airport (Johannesburg, 0.1) to the fifth (Abuja, 0.05). When considering the risk of initiating an outbreak in India, it is halved between New Delhi airport (0.42) and the fourth ranked Hyderabad airport (0.19). Therefore, implementation of epidemiological control measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is likely not to be optimal if applied uniformly to different locations. Instead, prioritization of thorough screening of infected hosts could be performed based on an airport's risk to initiate a COVID-19 outbreak. Rapid, non-laboratory based methods of COVID-19 infection detection are still lacking, and screening relies on manifestation of symptoms (e.g. body temperature). Hence, individuals with asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic infections may still slip through even high coverage rates of screening at airports, until newer methods of screening are developed. Current estimates for the frequency of such individuals and their infectivity are still uncertain [24] , [25] , but high frequency of such individuals may regardless force the introduction of new control measures [26] .",

Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain such data, and our model relied on previously modelled estimates (see Methods). Therefore, we emphasize the need in recent, or even live air travel data, and its importance to facilitate research and improved decision making for international COVID-19 outbreak control. Such data are crucial for real time management of crises of a scale we are currently observing.",

It combines air travel volume with destination population density, and does not rely on assumptions on COVID-19 incidence, as long as it is not very high. We note that as much as connectivity between different locations is important, it is only one component determining the risk of an outbreak. Our risk measure combines connectivity weighted by the probability to initiate an outbreak in a non-linear fashion, giving rise to a realistic risk measure for outbreaks. Our results demonstrate the heterogeneity in the risk of outbreak initiation on both global, as well as more local scales. As the COVID-19 pandemic will subside, full air travel shutdown will be deemed costly and at times infeasible. Therefore, we suggest future control and screening measures to be applied differentially, according to the estimated risks different locations pose to outbreak initiation.",
