From March 28 to April 4, 2020, this cross-sectional survey used an anonymous online questionnaire to collect data from respondents within Nigeria. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used to recruit 1357 respondents, aged 15-70 years, from 180 cities and towns within Nigeria. Study data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Approximately more than half (57.02%) of the respondents were male with high level of education (48.86% bachelor's degree or higher). Approximately half of the respondents (46.94%) opined that COVID-19 was -a biological weapon designed by the Chinese government.\u2016 About 94% of the respondents identified -contact with airborne droplets via breathing, sneezing, or coughing\u2016 as the most common mode of transmission; most respondents associated COVID-19 with coughing (81.13%), shortness of breath (73.47%) and fever (62.79%). -Regular hand washing and social distancing\u2016 was selected by most respondents (94.25%) as a way of preventing infection whereas 11.86% reported -consuming gins, garlic, ginger, herbal mixtures and African foods/soups\u2016 as preventive measures against COVID-19. Majority of the respondents (91.73%) thought COVID-19 is deadly; and most respondents (84.3%) got 4 or more answers correctly. It was also observed that the traditional media (TV/Radio) are the most common source of health information about COVID-19 (93.5%). Findings revealed that Nigerians have relatively high knowledge, mostly derived from traditional media, about COVID-19. Their perceptions of COVID-19 bear implications across public health initiatives, compliance with precautionary behavior as well as bilateral relations with foreign nations. Evidence-based campaign should be intensified to remove misconceptions and promote precautionary measures.",

On March 18, 2020, the Lagos State government suspended all gatherings above fifty people for four weeks and ordered all lower and middle level public officers to stay-at-home (Ewodage, 2020) . Similarly, the Federal government, on March 30, 2020 introduced various containment strategies such as closing of the national borders and airspace, schools, worship centers and other public places, canceling of mass gathering events and placing the Federal Capital Territory, Lagos and Ogun states on lock down for an initial period of fourteen days (Radio Nigeria, 2020) . Covid-19 testing laboratories were set up in Lagos, Abuja and Irrua in Edo State while State governments opened isolation centres and imposed dawn to dust curfews in their territories.",

The contagion could lead to severe respiratory problems or death, particularly among the elderly and persons with underlying chronic illnesses. Some infected persons however, are carriers for the virus with no symptoms while others may experience only a mild illness and recover easily (Sauer, 2020) .

While the scientific community continues to research possible vaccines or drugs for the viral infection, it is expected that adequate knowledge will motivate individuals to make decisions which may prevent and curb the epidemics. Knowledge such as regular hand washing, using hand sanitizers, wearing face masks, respiratory etiquettes, social distancing and selfisolation when sick are vital to reducing widespread infection (Leppin & Aro, 2009 ). Studies (e.g. Brug, Aro, Oenema, de Zwart, Richardus & Bishop, 2004; Choi & Yang, 2010; Hussain, Hussain & Hussain 2012) revealed that individuals' level of knowledge about an infectious disease can make them behave in ways that may prevent infection.

In line with this therefore, the Nigerian government (just like other governments around the world) introduced various containment strategies which have interfered with individuals' daily lives and have led to severe economic loss and social disruption. People were coerced to stay at home, businesses and offices were closed, exempting healthcare facilities/workers and -essential\u2016 commercial establishments. For Nigerians making a living in the informal economy, their livelihood is now threatened by the lockdown since much of their activities and businesses involve face-to-face contact. In Nigeria there is no social safety net, no access to food stamps or unemployment benefits, most people earn their living on a daily basis. Regardless of this however, there has so far been a high degree of compliance with the government directives, Nigerians are engaging in vigilant hand washing, practicing social distancing and self-isolation, and avoiding going to work, school or crowded areas. Even most religious leaders agreed to stop large gatherings, forbid the shaking of hands and directed church members to pray at home and use hand sanitizers (Makinde, Nwogu, Ajaja & Alagbe, 2020; Olatunji, 2020) .",

Also, the study supported Richards (2017) who opined that knowledge among ordinary people about how to eliminate risks of contracting Ebola virus led to a rapid drop in mid-2015 in the number of cases of infection. Consequently, individuals need to be informed about the potential risk of infection in order to adopt the right precautionary measures. One suggestion for this result is the knowledge factor. That is, Nigerians have knowledge of COVID-19 and therefore are better able to adopt precautionary measures.",

However, it contradicted Rolison and Hanoch (2015) which revealed that the internet is the premier source of knowledge during an outbreak.

Notwithstanding the above limitations, this study provides a baseline of information on knowledge and perceptions about the ravaging COVID-19 from respondents across 180 municipalities in Nigeria. It is worthy of note that this study is an exploratory one and is part of a larger study aimed at understanding and outlining how knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 among Nigerians is shaping their response to the pandemic and precautionary behavior. There is need for further research to build the evidence base for the study of COVID-19 knowledge and precautionary measures.",
