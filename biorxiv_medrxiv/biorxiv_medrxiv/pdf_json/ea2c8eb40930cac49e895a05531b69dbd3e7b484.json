On the other hand, the benefit of Lopinavir/Ritonavir is inconclusive, which is in consistent with the finding of Cao et al. (2020) , where Lopinavir/Ritonavir has associated with a reduction in the 28-day mortality from 25.0% to 19.2% in a randomized clinical trial, but fails to reach the statistical significance threshold [4] . Recently, Xu et al, (2020) reported that the virologic conversion rate in 49 patients taking Arbidol was significantly higher than that in 62 patients only receiving standard care (59.2% vs 40.3%, P=0.048). In the same study, the patients taking Arbidol also had a higher chance of achieving lesion area absorption on CT images (55.1% vs 32.2%) 27 . Despite limited sample sizes, their results further corroborate our findings. Arbidol's duo role in inhibiting the fusion between the viral envelope and target host cell membrane and in anti-inflammation may be responsible for its efficacy 28, 29 .",

Secondly, we didn't account for the effect of important supporting treatment such as oxygen and ventilator use. Their availability and deployment may affect the estimated treatment effect.

Furthermore, there are only 33 patients taking both Arbidol and Oseltamivir in the entire cohort, which limits the reliability of the estimated treatment benefit associated with the combination therapy. On the other hand, despite limited sample size and selective sampling, all identified risk factors in the current study are consistent with the literature 31 , which indirectly supports the validity of our findings on treatment efficacy.

In this cohort, older age, lower SpO2 level at admission, bigger lesion, and early admission data were all associated with higher mortality (eFigure 2). The mortality was 7.00% among patients who took Arbidol vs. 24.70% among patients who did not. The odds ratio (OR) was 0.230 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.124 to 0.411) favoring Arbdiol. The mortality was 12.12% among patients who took Oseltamivir, vs. 16.21% among patients who did not. The OR was 0.713 (95% CI, 0.282 to 1.589). The mortality was 14.29% among patients who took Lopinavir/Ritonavir, vs. 17.14% among patients who did not. The OR was 0.806 (95% CI, 0.483 to 1.341). After adjusting for sex, pre-existing condition, log(age), log(SpO2), log(lesion size), log(admission data) and hospital, all three antiviral medications were individually associated with a reduction in mortality: the adjusted OR was 0.169 (95% CI, 0.071 to 0.398) for Arbidol, 0.212 (95% CI, 0.072 to 0.623) for Oseltamivir, and 0.363 (95% CI, 0.165 to 0.795) for Lopinavir/Ritonavir. After further adjustment of antiviral medications use, the protective effect of Arbidol and Oseltamivir remained statistically significant: the adjusted OR was 0.183 (95% CI, 0.075 to 0.446; p<0.001) The Hosmer-Lemeshow test for this regression model suggested satisfactory goodness of fit (P=0.427).

The average reduction in lesion size between two scans was 46.43% (29.00%) among 209 patients taking Arbidol and 36.80% (SD: 24.95%) among 117 patients who did not. The average reductions among 55 patients taking Oseltamivir was less than that among 271 patients not taking (41.18% vs 43.34%). The reduction among 186 patients taking Lopinavir/Ritonavir was also less than 140 patients not taking (37.26% vs. 50.56%). After adjusting for patients' characteristics and antiviral medication use, the ratio of the lesion size after the treatment vs that before among patients taking Arbidol was 85.20% (95% CI, 74.47% to 97.48%; P=0.0203) of that among patients not taking Arbidol, suggesting faster lesion absorption.",
