Many biotechnology laboratories are rushing to develop therapeutic antibodies and antiviral drugs for treatment of this viral disease. The viral CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is one of the main targets for pharmacological intervention. Its receptor-binding domain (RBD) interacts with the human ACE2 receptor ensuring the entry of the viral genomes into the host cell. In this work, we report on the differences in the binding of the RBD of the previous coronavirus SARS-CoV and of the newer 2019-nCoV coronavirus to the human ACE2 receptor using atomistic molecular dynamics techniques. Our results show major mutations in the 2019-nCoV RBD with respect to the SARS-CoV RBD occurring at the interface of RBD-ACE2 complex.",

Specifically, the mutations eliminate one hydrogen bonding with the receptor, but increase the coordination number (number of contacts) by 20%. This leads to stronger non-bonded interactions (electrostatics and van der Waals) with the receptor compared to the SARS-CoV virus. The overall results suggest that the binding energy in the new SARS-CoV-2 viruses is slightly higher relative to the SARS-CoV virus. This is in reasonable agreement with experimental results reporting that the new corona virus has 10-20 times higher binding affinity for the ACE2 receptor than the old SARS-CoV. 27 Structurally, stronger binding is shown to not only stabilize the binding interface, but also to stabilize the overall structural fold of the viral RBD of the new SARS-CoV-2 viruses. This paper is organized as follows. After the introduction in Section 1, the detail of the computational procedure is presented in Section 2. In Section 3, the results are presented and discussed. We conclude in Section 4.",

The simulation box size was chosen so that the proteins in neighbor periodic box are at least 3 nm apart from each other. Since the electrostatic screening length at 150mM NaCl concentration is about 7\u00c5, this 3 nm distance is more than enough to eliminate the finite size effect due to long range electrostatic interactions among proteins in neighboring simulation boxes, yet small enough to keep the size of the system manageable with our current computational resources.

On the other hand, since these flexible and disordered terminal loops extend far into the aqueous solution, they significantly increase the size of the simulation box.

Clearly, the lower fluctuations of the backbone of the viral RBD in the SARS-CoV-2 viruses that we showed in earlier analyses correlate with this lowering in the configurational free energy of the RBD backbone. If one were to contribute this more stable structure due to a stronger binding free energy to the ACE2 receptor, a heuristic estimate for the latter should be about 2-4 times the entropic change, based on the typical balance between interaction energy and entropic configurational freedom for protein-protein complexes. 45 Our heuristic estimate thus gives a binding free energy difference, \u2206\u2206G of about \u22121 to \u22122.5 kcal/mol stronger for the new viruses. Experimentally, it is shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus has 10-20 times higher binding affinity to the receptor than SARS-CoV virus. 27 Using the relation \u2206G = k B T ln K d , a 10 to 20-fold increase in binding affinity corresponds to \u2206\u2206G in the range of \u2212k B T ln 10 to \u2212k B T ln 20, or about \u22121.5 to \u22122.0 kcal/mol. Thus, our heuristic, hand-waving estimate for the binding free energy difference agrees reasonably with this experimental range. One certainly requests a more comprehensive calculation of binding free energy to give more quantitative predictions. However, many traditional semiempirical methods for quick estimation of free energy which work decently for ligand-protein system fail for protein-protein system because of the large uncertainty related to the huge configurational space of the later.

            "text": "Dynamics (MD) simulations. The viral RBD represents one of the main possible targets for the development of antiviral drugs, therefore, understanding the binding between the viral RBD and ACE2 can be very useful for rational drug design. We exploited the fact that different 3D protein structures of the ACE2 in complex with the RBD of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are available in the Protein Data Bank: (i) SARS-CoV RBD in complex with ACE2, PDB code: 2AJF 24 (ii) SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with ACE2, PDB code: 6VW1 25 (iii) SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with ACE2, PDB code: 6M0J. 26 By using two SARS-CoV-2 samples and one SARS-CoV sample, we can effectively compare the variations among the viruses, as well as identify the important and unimportant mutations and interactions. Molecular dynamics is performed to investigate the characteristics of the binding mechanism between viral RBDs and its receptor. Sequence, structural and dynamical analyses are carried out to identify similarities and differences between the new SARS-CoV-2 viruses and the previous SARS-CoV virus. Our results provide a molecular understanding of the binding complex and show that the new viruses bind more strongly to the receptor. Despite variations between the sequences of the two SARS-CoV-2 viruses, the two samples of the new viruses behave very similarly, and have similar binding properties for the human receptor. By eliminating unimportant differences in the sequences of the new viruses, and comparing them to the sequence of the old SARS-CoV virus, four important mutations between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are identified: Y to L455, VP to EI471-472, -PP to GVE482-484, and Y to Q498 (the indices are that of SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is shifted higher by 13 compared to SARS-CoV virus numbering). They are shown structurally to be at or close to the binding interface with the receptor protein. The mutations lead to higher flexibility of the backbones by substitution of Prolines and insertion of Glycine. The mutations also reduce number of hydrophobic interactions at the interface since hydrophobic residues are substituted with charged or polar residues.

One can see from this figure that despite variations in the exact sequences of the two SARS-CoV-2 samples, they behave very similarly to each other (the blue and green curves). Both of them are more stable, with less thermal fluctuations than the SARS-CoV virus (the red curve). The downward arrows in this figure show the locations of the four mutations highlighted in Fig. 2. The mutation, -PP to GVE, leads to the strongest, most notable difference between the two viruses, with the new coronavirus showing much less fluctuations. This is in line with our earlier suggestion that insertion of Glycine and substitution of rigid Proline make the backbone more flexible, allowing it to move closer to the receptor and to bind tighter to it.",

Specifically, the 6M0J sample shows significant probability for low coordination number and also lower number of hydrogen bonds, perhaps lower binding energy compared to 6VW1 sample. However,these variations do not change the most probable values of the distributions. This suggests that sequence variations in these two SARS-CoV-2 virus samples are not too important for the receptor binding, while the sequence variations from 2AJF SARS-CoV viruses matters more. This fact is similar to many analyses done so far that the two new SARS-CoV-2 viruses behave very much alike each other, and both are different from SARS-CoV virus behavior. This justifies our criteria for selection of the four regions of important mutations as highlighted in Fig. 2.

The trace of the covariance matrix is a measure of the overall flexibility of the proteins. As one can see from this table, the trace for ACE2 for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 6VW1 are large and similar to each other. This is expected, since the human ACE2 receptor is a big protein, with same sequence and almost identical native structures in these systems. The ACE2 protein of SARS-CoV-2 6M0J sample shows even a higher value. This may be related to the missing Cl \u2212 ion in the experimental structure, and less degrees of glycosylations of ACE2 protein in this sample (see the preliminary Section).The difference between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses are apparent from the PCA information for the viral RBD domain. Here, the SARS-CoV 2AJF shows much larger trace of 1.8 nm 2 while both SARS-CoV-2 samples shows a trace of only 1.2 nm 2 .
