Due to the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission nature of this virus, a growing demand for diagnostic testing is a serious challenge even for developed countries. Various serological tests have been developed and approved in some Asian, European countries and America [4] . The reliability of both types of tests and in particular in asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients has been brought to question due the number of reported false negatives. Therefore, radiology units in hospitals would have been naturally involved in assessing level of infection using their various scanning images (e.g. CT and Ultrasound). Ai, et al, manually examined Chest CT scan images of 1014 patients and demonstrated that such a scan provides a reliable tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection [5] . More interestingly, they found that a number of patients had positive Chest CT findings despite having an initial negative PCR test thus confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19.",

Higher frequency ranges are associated with image texture features. Human observers, including trained radiologists, might find it difficult to detect informative features from FFT spectrum images. However, a wealth of research on use of machine learning for image analysis provide strong evidences that FFT indeed incapsulate rich characterising texture information that discriminating power when used for classifying tissue/organ abnormality. There are many different known procedures to analyse the texture content of the FFT spectrum. However, the only texture analysis tool that can effectively determine the nature of the lines out of the central region in the FFT spectrum is the Gabor filter [14] , which is a band-pass spatial filter that determine specific frequency content in the image in chosen ranges of directions and scales in the region of analysis. Figure 1 illustrates the output of using the FFT-Gabor scheme as shown of filtering the Fourier spectrum image in 5 scales and 10 orientations. It is easy to visibly note the differences in the pattern displayed in each of the 50 small FFT-Gabor blocks between the positive and negative COVID-19 cases.",

We first randomly selected 75 positive and 75 negative images , then 60% from the total of 150 images used for training the SVM classifier and use the remaining 40% of images to test the performance of the trained model counting the number of success and failure, after that repeat the process 30 times, then calculate the average of the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

Indeed all the schemes outperform the one in [6] when tested on the original 470 images, with the FFT-Gabor scheme resulting in 10% absolute increased accuracy.
