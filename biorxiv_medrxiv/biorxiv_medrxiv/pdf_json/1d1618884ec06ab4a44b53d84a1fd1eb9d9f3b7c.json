Other studies all reported CRP level was positively related to the severity of COVID-19. PCT is also a main inflammatory marker routinely measured in clinical practice. Among 9 studies, the levels of PCT were all higher in severe group than non-severe group. ESR is a non-specific inflammatory marker, which mainly reflects the changes of plasma protein types (Wu et al., 2018) . In our metaanalysis, we found higher ESR level in severe group than non-severe group. One reason is that patients in severe group had higher inflammation. Another possible explanation is that patients with older age in severe group contributed to the higher level of ESR considering that the level of ESR increased with age (Piva et al., 2001) .",
