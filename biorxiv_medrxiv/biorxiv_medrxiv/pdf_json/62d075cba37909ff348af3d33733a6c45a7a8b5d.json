Screening methods are unable to identify all cases, due to limitations in the sensitivity and specificity. Exposed travellers can complete a journey during the incubation period when they are undetectable, and some exposed travellers may never show symptoms at all [10, 11] . Furthermore, when applied early in an epidemic, screening methods that rely on detecting fever will identify many more cases of other respiratory diseases such as influenza than the target disease. While travel restrictions are highly unlikely to prevent the ultimate importation of COVID-19 [12] , they can reasonably be anticipated to delay the establishment of an epidemic in a country, buying valuable time for health authorities to establish response measures.",

The expected numbers of imported cases in each intermediary country was estimated using an approach proposed by De Salazar and colleagues (2020) based on air travel volume estimates from China since COVID-19 emergence [12] . Their model estimates the expected number of imported cases in countries by regressing the number of imported cases reported by each country against their relative incoming travel volumes from China (under unrestricted travel). They assume that the expected case count would be linearly proportional to air travel volume. Bootstrap sampling was used to estimate 95% confidence intervals. We fitted the model to reported cumulative case counts for each country extracted from WHO situation reports 2, 9, 16, 23, and 30 (i.e., one per week from January 22).",

The dominant importation risk to Australia at the time of analysis was directly from China, as the only country reporting uncontained transmission. With travel restrictions from mainland China to Australia imposed from February 1, our framework was designed to consider the importation risk from China (source country) into Australia (country of interest) via potential intermediary countries. We focused on countries in the South East Asia and Western Pacific regions as potential intermediary countries since they are highly connected to both China and Australia, relative to the rest of the world. Intuitively, intermediary countries that pose the highest overall risk of importation to a country of interest are those with high connectivity to both the source country and country of 5 .

The breakdown of our workflow (Figure 1 ) provides clear guidance on how to adjust the method. Importantly, the framework itself still applies, but components of the analysis would need to be adapted. As implemented, our estimates of importation rates into countries only consider air travel (Step 1). Several countries/regions have high volumes of land travel, for example mainland China and Hong Kong. Not accounting for these would lead to an underestimate of importation risk to these countries/regions. Furthermore, the estimated importation rates are relative to global reports of imported cases of COVID-19. If there was systematic under-detection of COVID-19 across all countries at the time of analysis [19] , this would lead to a systematic underestimation of importation rates.

            "text": "A further strength of our approach is its use of a stochastic model, including control efforts, for early epidemic response in intermediate countries. Here, without access to detailed additional information on intermediate country's capacity to respond, we used a simple model of country response capacity. As outbreaks progress, differences in how effectively countries are able to respond, both in terms of their health system capacity, and their ability to implement population-based measures such as social distancing may introduce systematic effects that are not captured by the framework. With additional information or dedicated further research in anticipation of future global events, this additional information could be incorporated into the framework (at Steps 3 and 4) to improve predictive capabilities. It is also worth noting that here we used a stringent definition of outbreak control (truly no cases) compared to other approaches in the literature, which may define control as a substantially smaller number of cases compared to baseline [20] .",

The framework provides an evidence base for decisions on border measures and case definitions, and it has been successfully used during the early phase of the COVID-19 response in the Australian context, when limited cases had been reported outside of mainland China.",
