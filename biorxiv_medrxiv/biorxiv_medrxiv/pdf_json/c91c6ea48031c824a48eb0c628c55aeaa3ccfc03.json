Due to possible extreme effects, such as hospitals potentially running out of beds or medical equipment, it is essential to lower the infection rate to create enough space to attend to the affected people and allow enough time for a vaccine to be developed. Unfortunately, this requires that measures put into place are upheld long enough to reduce the infection rate sufficiently.",

One way to conduct such evaluations is to design a representative model which simulates and mimics the real world phenomena as close as possible. With such a model, certain parameters and influences can be assessed by modifying the model and observing its reaction, which is what this paper is about.",

The model is described as a differential system in which multiple factors depend on each other to determine the behavior of the three levels S, I, and R. The equations herein were as follows [also see 9]: With these equations, a simulation system was be derived that models the current situation of the COVID-19 spread in a simplified way. Since the aforementioned infrastructure and hospital strain was of importance for the Coronavirus pandemic, the model was modified to include time delays due to incubation and a portion of the infected people who would not go directly from \"infected\" to \"removed\" and rather move to hospitalization. From hospitalization then there were two options, either a delayed demise of the individual, or a delayed recovery, which adds the individual back to R. These additions modify the equations above as follows and add equations (VII) and (VIII): The simulation model based on these parameters was setup in Vensim [10] with time and calculation steps of one day.

Herein, after the above described problem definition in a first step, the parameters of the model were set to yield an adequate and verifiable outcome. Such a verification was conducted by comparing the model results to real world data that was reported during the current pandemic. Wirth the set parameters (also see next section), multiple scenarios were simulated and examined based on various conditions that were chosen, always derived from real and current circumstances. These scenarios will be described in the fourth and fifth section. The outcomes were compared as far as the different levels of the simulations components go. For example, the infection rates and total cases could be compared to determine the speed of the spread and therefore the rise of the total case number over time. Another option is the comparison and evaluation of fatality numbers and hospital strain over time to assess how different scenarios effect the end results and possibly discover potential shortages at certain times.",

This is further exacerbated by the fact that it is possible to carry the virus without ever showing symptoms [see 18] . Thus, the number of COVID-19 cases resulting from a simulation has to be way higher than what the real data represents. Actual numbers and estimation for the unknown numbers are hard to find and estimations range from over 70 percent unknown cases [19] to ten times the confirmed number or more [20] . Therefore, the number of unknown cases in the model was adjusted so that the model aligned from March 1 st to March 20 th with the reported real time data. In order to achieve this, the model was set to 15 infections at the time of the first reported case. This lead to a realistic outcome of the simulation and also served as verification of the design as the fatality rate and the case numbers correlated with the data when taken into consideration the unknown cases.",

Furthermore, such a scenario, while plausible and possible, is not realistic since measures put in place do not go into effect at once and everyone adheres to them immediately at the time they go into effect.

This way, the rates decrease over time until they reach certain events or a limit, which is more realistic since people adjust to new circumstances and in this case regulations gradually over time. Thus, the starting point of the regulations mentioned in the previous scenario was used to introduce effective contact rate reductions with a delay of one day. For example, the blue line in Figure 4 indicates a reduction of 1 for the effective contact rate after day 16 for 9 consecutive days until the rate reaches 1.325. With this data, we can see that the run with the steps of 0.5 down to 1.825 is closest to reality and approaches the fatality number currently reported. Furthermore, we see that the gradual reduction of the effective contact rate leads to a peak in the infection rate which then introduces a downswing and successive upswing albeit the latter with a lower gradient of the Infection Rate over time. Therefore, we can say that the gradual reduction of the effective contact rate is an effective measure to control the epidemic and can even hedge the upswing of the virus spread, as shown by Figure 4 .",

This is due to the decrease in between those two dates not being sufficient for the measures to fight back the short upswing in a limited time. Therefore, these two increases could yield hundreds of thousands of new infections and thus could also even double the number of hospitalized patients. Second, in the long run, these short increases in effective contact rates can have detrimental impacts when it comes to the fatality numbers as a result of the increased hospitalizations. In the worst case, this could lead to an increase in fatality numbers of 60% after 90 days, not taking into consideration that hospitals might be overloaded and forced into triage procedure where limited resources have to be allocated and decisions have to be made which patients can receive treatments at all.",

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK The previous sections have shown that the effects of such a dynamic and complex systems as this pandemic are by no means linear and predictable by mere extrapolation. Even with the measures and the current standings, short increase and maybe even returns to \"normal\" effective contact rates can have detrimental outcomes that cause permanent effects impossible to cure even when caught early. The two simulation scenarios 3 and 4 demonstrated that even single short increases can show these behaviors and temporarily sustained ones increase and amplify the impact through reciprocity.",

These effects ripple through the system and impact hospitalizations and ultimately fatalities, increasing the former by as much as 146% at the peak and the latter by as much as 106% in the worst case compared to the references without contact increases.",

Thus, the results allow a predictions to an extent when a wave as a result of an increase in infection numbers might come.
