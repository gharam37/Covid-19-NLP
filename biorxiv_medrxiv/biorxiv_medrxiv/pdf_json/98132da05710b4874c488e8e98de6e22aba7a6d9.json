Rapid and informed guidance of 29 epidemic (research) responses to severe infectious disease outbreaks requires quick 30 compilation and integration of existing pathophysiological knowledge. As a case 31 study we chose the Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak that started in 2015 to develop a 32 proof-of-concept knowledge repository. To extract data from available sources and 33 build a computationally tractable and comprehensive molecular interaction map we 34 applied generic knowledge management software for literature mining, expert 35 knowledge curation, data integration, reporting and visualisation. A multi-disciplinary 36 team of experts, including clinicians, virologists, bioinformaticians and knowledge 37 management specialists, followed a pre-defined workflow for rapid integration and 38 evaluation of available evidence. While conventional approaches usually require 39 months to comb through the existing literature, the initial ZIKV KnowledgeBase 40 (ZIKA KB) was completed within a few weeks. Recently we updated the ZIKA KB 41 with additional curated data from the large amount of literature published since 2016 42 and made it publicly available through a web interface together with a step-by-step 43 guide to ensure reproducibility of the described use case (S4). In addition, a detailed 44 online user manual is provided to enable the ZIKV research community to generate 45 hypotheses, share knowledge, identify knowledge gaps, and interactively explore 46 and interpret data (S5). A workflow for rapid response during outbreaks was 47 generated, validated and refined and is also made available. The process described 48",

For knowledge representation we applied a 171 semantic network approach as described previously (16, 17) . Briefly, the abstract 172 concepts necessary to capture and represent essential ideas and physical objects 173 relevant to the domain of knowledge were defined. Based on input from clinical and 174 virology experts, the concepts required to represent existing pathophysiological 175 knowledge of infectious diseases were modelled with objects, such as \"genes\", 176 \"strains\", \"is expressed in\" or \"interacts with\". For the ZIKV KB, we focused on 177 concepts required to represent text-mining results and information from structured 178 databases of protein-protein (PPI) and drug-protein interactions, namely genes, 179 diseases, pathogens and drugs. Relationships between pathogens, genes, drugs 180 and compounds extracted by text-mining were represented by three types of 181 relations: up-regulation, down-regulation and regulation (for further details see S2 182 diseases. The defined semantic concepts become directly available in a natural-185 language-like query and reporting language. This language can be used to address 186 specific questions and to summarise and visualise available knowledge. For 187 example, the query \"is a drug which interacts with is a protein from organism human 188 which is expressed by a gene which is associated with a organism Zika\" retrieves the 189 number of drugs that interact with a protein of interest and generates a visualisation 190 which applies a color coding to genes that indicates to the number of associated 191 drugs. 192",

These genes can serve as 421an entry point to be tested in specific assays designed to unravel molecular 422 mechanisms between of ZIKV involvement in microcephaly. 423Another predicted ZIKV effective drug is Sorafenib, a multi-target tyrosine kinase 424inhibitor. The ZIKV map was used to identify the effective target of Sorafenib: 4251. Sorafenib interacts with 4 target genes, FLT3, BRAF, VEGFR (also known as 426 KDR) and PDGFR. The latter two genes are known to interact with additional drugs, 427 such as Sunitinib, Pazopanib, Dasatinib and Imatinib. These additional drugs were 428 among those which had no effect in the ZIKV infection assay. 429 2. In ZIKV infection expression data, none of the genes producing protein products 430 that interact with VEGFR and PDGFR through known PPI (orange edges) with ZIKV 431 are differentially expressed (Fig 8) . In The network analysis described above could also be used to rank drugs according to 462 their distance to known ZIKV associated genes, such as STAT2, to suggest a metric 463 for priorisation in screening assays (34). The discussed extended ZIKV map contains 464 429 target gene products that interact with FDA approved drugs. Evaluation of the 465 distance between STAT2 and drug targets via experimentally proven PPIs revealed 466 that targets of ZIKV effective drugs were on average more proximal to STAT2 467 compared to other targets. 468Combining the proximity measure with additional knowledge, for example the \"FDA 469 pregnancy\" label, reduces the number of drugs to be screened from 774 to 64.

Compounds (white nodes) were referenced to entries of 724 the ChEBI ontology. Diseases (violet nodes) and genes (orange nodes) can 725 reference one or multiple sources such as ICD10, Entrez or Ensembl. Relationships 726 between pathogens, genes, drugs and compounds were defined by three types of 727 text mining relations, upregulation (green edges), downregulation (red edges) and 728 regulation (black edges). Associated information, not represented as object or 729 relation, is being stored as so called \"annotation\" basically a note that can be 730 assigned to any semantic concept. The annotation form \"Textmining information 731 evidence\", for example, stores information, such as the sentence containing the 732 extracted statement (field \"Reference\") or the predicate (field \"Interaction type\") and 733 links directly to the PubMed entry (represented as BioRS entry: MEDLINE). To 734 enable experts to support or contradict extracted text mining relationships the 735 annotation form \"Textmining Validation\" was introduced to generate a configurable 736 curation workflow. Molecular interaction and disease maps are modelled using the 737 \"context\" object type to group specific sub-networks (interactions between genes, 738 diseases, pathogens and drugs) within the global semantic network. PPI and drug-739 protein interactions are represented by the \"Interaction\" relation (orange edges) with 740 supportive evidence stored in two annotation forms (\"BioGRID Interaction Evidence\" 741 and \"Interaction Information\" storing information from the VirHostNet database), and 742can be added as additional sub-networks to a disease map. 743Based on the data model dynamic visualisation can be generated, for example drug 744 targets or differentially expressed genes based on configurable queries and views. 745The data model is automatically transformed into a natural language like query and 746reporting language. This language can be used to e.g. define a query retrieving the 747 number of drugs that interact with a protein of interest, and generating a view which 748 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.044743 doi: bioRxiv preprint",
