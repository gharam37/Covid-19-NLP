Further, the rate of growth of infections in India is very close to that in Washington and California. Exponential and classic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models based on available data are used to make short and long-term predictions on a daily basis. Based on the SIR model, it is estimated that India will enter equilibrium by the end of May 2020 with the final epidemic size of approximately 13,000. However, this estimation will be invalid if India enters the stage of community transmission. The impact of social distancing, again with the assumption of no community transmission, is also assessed by comparing data from different geographical locations.",

As of March 30, 2020, there have been about 0.8 million confirmed cases of COVID-2019 and about 40,000 reported deaths globally. About one-third of the world population is currently under lockdown to arrest the spread of this highly infectious disease. COVID-19 is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, for which there is no specific medication or vaccine approved by medical authorities yet. This disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets or fomites, and the incubation period may range from 2 to 14 days [1] . Though the overall fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%, the disease can be fatal to elderly people (about 27% for 60+ age groups) and those with an underlying medical history. Studies [2, 1] have presented characteristics of COVID-19 disease describing symptoms and the latest developments.",

Further, in the latter case, Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartment model [8] is used to include considerations for susceptibles, infectious, and recovered or deceased individuals.

India announced a countrywide lockdown on March 24 for 21 days although a study by Singh and Adhikari [9] have suggested that this period may be insufficient for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. In the present study, we assessed the effects of social distancing measures from the time of spread, by comparing lockdown status of India with several other countries, and states in the US and China. It is shown that the early action of lockdown in India, compared to many other countries/states, can have a favourable effect in limiting the final epidemic size.

            "text": "As the current model is fully dependent on data, it is imperative to comment on the nature of this data. Different countries have different strategies for conducting COVID-19 diagnostic tests. In India, testing has largely been limited to individuals travelling from high-risk countries and their immediate contacts, as well as selected Pneumonia patients and symptomatic healthcare workers. As of March 30, India has tested 42,788 samples. Indian medical authorities have justified this strategy by testing randomly collected samples. Sahasranaman and Kumar [10] have compared basic reproduction number R 0 from India and the world to analyze this strategy. R 0 is the transmission rate given that the population has no immunity from past exposures or vaccination, nor any deliberate intervention in disease transmission. The number of infections grow and spread in the population if R 0 > 1. They have found that R 0 from India (R 0 \u2248 0.43) is much smaller than the rest of the world (1.5 < R 0 < 2.5), and the numbers reported in India may not be reflective of the actual number of cases. However, by considering a longer date range from March 10 to March 30, we show that the value of R 0 from India is comparable to infection rates reported elsewhere. Further, we find that the growth of infections in India is comparable to that in California and Washington. In any case, current models do not depend on the testing strategy provided the same protocol is used throughout the time-period. In other words, the ratio of actual to reported number of cases will remain the same at any given time. On the other hand, the uncertainty due to exclusion of asymptomatic cases can be a major limitation in predictions with these models.",

It should be noted that if the reported number of cases begins to exceed the predicted end-state systematically, then the pandemic will enter a new stage, and none of the models described above will be applicable. Although as of March 30, there is no strong evidence for community transmission (which can be achieved only by extensive testing and enlarging testing criteria). However, high population density as well as social and demographical issues puts India on a high risk for community transmission (stage-3). Although, the social distancing and rigorous contact tracing measures taken by India may help in containing these transmissions to small clusters, migration of labourers and workers could worsen the situation.

There have been several reports (see for example, [10] ) that have indicated that the initial slow growth of infections in India could be an artifact of its testing strategy, where testing is limited to specific individuals travelling from high-risk countries and their immediate contacts. Figure 1 shows the growth of infections in India from 1 to 1000, along with other countries and states with a reasonable number of daily international travellers. These places have used different testing strategies to report the number of infections. The growth rate in India is much smaller than places like New York and New Jersey, where the spread is very fast and it took only 16-17 days to reach 1,000 cases. Italy and France took about 29 and 43 days respectively to reach the same figure. On the other hand, places like California and Washington took a relatively long time (about 55-58 days), which is similar to India that took 59 days. Further, the growth curve of India is very close to that of Washington. As India is 9 days behind Washington in outbreak history, this information could be very useful as one may look at the Washington data to make predictions for India.",

Though, this presents a very frightening picture as the number of affected individuals may go up to 0.5 million by April 30, with a single-day increase of around 90,000 patients.

As seen, the cases in the Hubei province continued to rise till Feb 14 to reach a total of 54,406, with the total number of new cases reported on that day being about 6,200.

According to an estimate by Chang et al. [19] for COVID-19 outbreak in Australia, a reduction in incidence and prevalence can be visible only if the social distancing compliance levels exceed 80%. Now, we focus on the impact of social distancing in India. India announced a strict lockdown on 24 March, when the number of reported cases was 536. Though on 22 March, India observed Janta Curfew (voluntary lockdown) and the public activity has been limited since that date.",

Figure 5 shows the impact of social distancing in these scenarios. Exponential growth is assumed throughout to account for the worst-case scenario. A reduction of 70% can bring the cases to a more controllable number i.e. a total of around 28,000 patients on April 20. Further, If India follows the case isolation strategy strictly, it is expected that this curve will start flattening out after that date (estimated based on the date from Hubei in Figure 4(a) ).",

            "text": "This exploratory evaluation shows that the transmission rate of COVID-19 in India is comparable to that in Washington state in the US. The curves describing the initial phase of the outbreak for both the locations are very close. As the beginning of the outbreak in Washington was about 9 days prior to that in India, the current data from the former can be used to make informative predictions for India. Along the similar argument, we show that the transmission rate and basic reproduction number R 0 for India are in the expected range. This is contrary to several reports questioning the testing strategies adopted by India quoting a low transmission rate and hence the smaller basic reproduction number. Two epidemiological models -a simple exponential model and an SIR model, are used respectively to forecast short and long term outcomes. These models assume all the seed cases to be symptomatic, which may underestimate the actual numbers due to an uncertain number of asymptomatic individuals. With this limitation, the exponential model based on data till March 23 nicely predicts the values till today (March 30). The SIR model based on data till March 30 indicates that India will enter equilibrium by the end of May with an estimated total number of infected cases to be approximately 13,000. It is estimated that the impact of social distancing will be visible after April 8 following which we may see a significant reduction in the reported infections. However, India is on high risk to enter into community transmission due to reported violation of quarantine norms by individuals as well as other social and demographic issues. The predictions made using the current epidemiological models in the current work will be invalid if such an event occurs. Finally, the model is as good as the underlying data. Because of real time change in data daily, the predictions will accordingly change. Hence, the results from this paper should be used only for qualitative understanding and reasonable estimate of the nature of outbreak, but are not advisable for any decision making or policy change.",
