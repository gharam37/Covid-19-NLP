In the absence of an effective vaccine, inhibitor repurposing or de novo drug design may offer a longer-term strategy to combat this and future infections due to similar viruses. Here, we report on detailed classical and mix-solvent molecular dynamics simulations of the main protease (Mpro) enriched by evolutionary and stability analysis of the protein. The results were compared with those for a highly similar SARS Mpro protein. In spite of a high level of sequence similarity, the active sites in both proteins show major differences in both shape and size indicating that repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19 may be futile. Furthermore, analysis of the binding site's conformational changes during the simulation time indicates its flexibility and plasticity, which dashes hopes for rapid and reliable drug design. Conversely, structural stability of the protein with respect to flexible loop mutations indicates that the virus' mutability will pose a further challenge to the rational design of small-molecule inhibitors. However, few residues contribute significantly to the protein stability and thus can be considered as key anchoring residues for Mpro inhibitor design.",

            "text": "In early December 2019, the first atypical pneumonia outbreak associated with the novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (SARS-CoV-2) appeared in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China [1, 2] . In general, coronaviruses (CoVs) are classified into four major genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus (which primarily infect mammals), Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (which primarily infect birds) [3] [4] [5] . In humans, coronaviruses usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, e.g., the common cold, however, the rarer forms of CoVs can be lethal. By the end of 2019, six kinds of human CoV have been identified: HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, belonging to Alphacoronavirus genera, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS-CoV, belonging to Betacoronavirus genera [4] . Of the aforementioned CoVs, the last two are the most dangerous and they were associated with the outbreak of two epidemics at the beginning of the 21st century [6] . On January 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was isolated and announced as a new, seventh, type of human coronavirus. It was classified as Betacoronavirus [2] . Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the genomic data of SARS-CoV-2, Zhang et al. indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to two SARS-CoV sequences isolated from bats in 2015 and 2017. This is suggestive that the bat's CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share a common ancestor, and the new virus can be considered as a SARS-like virus [7] .",

It also includes a variable number of open reading frames (ORFs)from 6 to 11. The first ORF is the largest, encoding nearly 70% of the entire genome and 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) [3, 8] . Of the nsps, the main protease (Mpro, also known as a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease, 3CLpro), encoded by nsp5, has been found to play a fundamental role in viral gene expression and replication, thus it is an attractive target for anti-CoV drug design [9] . The remaining ORFs encode accessory protease: one, referred to as SARS-CoV Mpro N3 (PDB ID: 2amq), co-crystallised with the same N3 inhibitor, and the other without an inhibitor (PDB ID: 1q2w), which we refer to as SARS-CoV Mpro. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV Mpro structures differ by only 12 amino acids located mostly on the proteins' surface ( Figure 1A , Supplementary Table S1 ). Both enzymes share the same structural composition; they comprise three domains: domains I (residues 1-101) and II (residues 102-184) consist of an antiparallel \u03b2-barrel, and the \u03b1-helical domain III (residues 201-301) is required for the enzymatic activity [27] . Both enzymes resemble the structure of cysteine proteases, although their active site is lacking the third catalytic residue [28] ; their active site comprises a catalytic dyad, namely H41 and C145, and a particularly stable water molecule forms at least three hydrogen bond interactions with surrounding residues, including the catalytic histidine, which corresponds to the position of a third catalytic member ( Figure 1B ). It should be also noted that one of the differing amino acids in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, namely S46, is located on a C44-P52 loop, which is flanking the active site cavity. Close-up of the active site cavity and bound N3 inhibitor into SARS-CoV (black sticks) and SARS-CoV-2 (blue sticks) Mpros. The catalytic water molecule that resembles the position of the third member of the catalytic triad adopted from the cysteine proteases is shown for both SARS-CoV (black sphere) and SARS-CoV-2 (blue sphere) Mpros. The active site residues are shown as red sticks and the proteins' structures are shown in surface representation. The differing residues in position 46 located near the entrance to the active site are marked with an asterisk (*) on the (A) and as blue and black lines on the (B) panel.",

A combination of the cMD approach with water molecules used as molecular probes is assumed to provide a highly detailed picture of the protein's interior dynamics [29] . The small molecules tracking approach was used to determine the accessibility of the active site pocket in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpros, and a local distribution approach was used to provide information about an overall distribution of solvent in the proteins' interior. To properly examine the flexibility of both active site cavities, we used the time-window mode implemented in AQUA-DUCT software [30] to analyse the water molecules' flow through the cavity in a 10 ns time step and combined that with the outer pocket calculations to examine the plasticity and maximal accessible volume (MAV) of the binding cavity.",

This could be indirectly assumed from the absence of the C44-P52 loop in the crystallographic structure of SARS-CoV Mpro structure. On the other hand, such flexibility could suggest that the presence of an inhibitor might stabilise the loops surrounding the active site. It is worth adding, that this loop is carrying the unique SARS-CoV-2 Mpro residue S46. ",

This is interesting since, in the absence of cosolvent molecules, the water accessible volume for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was 50% smaller than in the case of SARS-CoV Mpro, underlining huge plasticity of the binding cavity and suggesting large conformational changes induced by interaction with a potential ligand.

Secondly, the C44-P52 loop regulates access to the active site and can contribute to the discrimination of potential inhibitors. Therefore, additional mutations in the above-mentioned regions, which could appear during further SARS-CoV-2 evolution, can significantly change the affinity between Mpro and its ligands. To verify potential threat of further mutability of the Mpro protein we performed: i) correlated mutation analysis (CMA) on multiple sequence alignment, ii) the analysis of the contribution of already identified differences between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpros to protein stability, and iii) prediction of further possible mutations caused by the most probable mutations, the substitution of single nucleotides in the mRNA sequence of Mpro.",

It is worth adding that among evolutionary-correlated residues we identified also those that differ between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Mpros, located on the C44-P52 loop ( Figure 6 ) and the F185-T201 linker loop. The CMA analysis indicates that particular residues in both loops are evolutionary-correlated. The Q189 from the linker loop correlates with residues from the C44-P52 loop, whereas R188, A191, and A194 correlate with selected residues from all domains, but not with the C44-P52 loop.

Interestingly, residues forming the catalytic dyad, namely H41 and C145, are also prone to mutate. However, probably the most important message comes from the analysis of the potential mutability of the C44-P52 loop. Mutation of four of them has a stabilising effect for the protein and for the rest the effect is near-neutral.

Dimerisation of the enzyme is necessary for its catalytic activity and the proper conformation of the seven N-terminal residues (N-finger) is required [40] . In SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, the T285 is replaced by alanine, and the I286 by leucine. It has been shown that replacing S284, T285, and I286 by alanine residues in SARS-CoV Mpro leads to a 3.6-fold enhancement of the catalytic activity of the enzyme. This is accompanied by changes in the structural dynamics of the enzyme that transmit the effect of the mutation to the catalytic centre.

There are also differences in the outer pockets' maximal accessible volumes between the two structures of SARS-CoV main proteases; the apo SARS-CoV Mpro structure used as a starting point of MD simulations has shown the largest MAV of all the analysed systems. These results suggest that the SARS-CoV main proteases' binding cavity is highly flexible and changes both in volume and shape significantly alter the ligand binding. This finding indicates a serious obstacle for a classical virtual screening approach and drug design in general. Numerous novel compounds that are considered as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV, have not reached the stage of clinical trials. The lack of success might be related to the above-mentioned plasticity of the binding cavity. Some of these compounds have been used for docking and virtual screening research aimed not only at SARS-CoV [42, 43] but also at the novel SARS-CoV-2 [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Such an approach focuses mostly on the structural similarity between the binding pockets, but ignores the fact that the actual available binding space differs significantly. In general, a rational drug design can be a very successful tool in the identification of possible inhibitors in cases where the atomic resolution structure of the target protein is known. For a new target, when a highly homologous structure is available, a very logical strategy would be seeking chemically similar compounds or creating derivatives of this inhibitor, and finding those compounds that are predicted to have a higher affinity for the new target structure than the original one. This would be expected to work for SARS-CoV-2 proteins (such as Mpro) using SARS-CoV proteins as templates. However, our in-depth analysis indicates a very different situation taking place, with major shape and size differences emerging due to the binding site flexibility. The continuous effort of Diamond Light Source group [44] performing massive XChem crystallographic fragment screen against Mpro supports our finding on large binding site flexibility (Supplementary Figure S4) . Therefore, repurposing SARS drugs against COVID-19 may not be successful due to major shape and size differences, and despite docking methods, the enhanced sampling should be considered.",

The remaining water hot-spots correspond to a much lower water density level and are on the borders of the binding cavity, which suggests a rather hydrophobic or neutral interior of the binding cavity. The MixMD simulations performed with various cosolvents have further confirmed these observations. The largest number and the densest hot-spots were located within the binding cavity and the region essential for Mpros dimerisation [31] , between the II and III domains. The deep insight into the local hot-spots distribution of the various cosolvents underlines the large differences in binding sites plasticity. The smaller binding cavity of the SARS-CoV-2 enlarged significantly in the presence of a highly hydrophobic cosolvent. The benzene hot-spots were detected deep inside the cavity, and also near the C44-P52 loop. In contrast, in the case of the SARS-CoV, benzene hot-spots were located only in the vicinity of the C44-P52 loop. Such a conclusion may also imply that a sufficiently potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV and/or SARS-CoV-2 Mpros needs to be able to open its way to the active site before it can successfully bind to its cavity. These results support the regulatory role of the C44-P52 loop and again alert against unwarranted use of simplified approaches for drug repositioning or docking.",

            "text": "In this paper, we reported on molecular dynamics simulations of the main protease (Mpro), whose crystal structures have been released. We compared the Mpro for SARS-CoV-2 with a highly similar SARS-CoV protein. In spite of a high level of sequence similarity between these two homologous proteins, their active sites show major differences in both shape and size indicating that repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19 may be futile. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the binding pocket's conformational changes during simulation time indicates its flexibility and plasticity, which dashes hope for rapid and reliable drug design. Moreover, our findings show the presence of a flexible loop regulating the access to the binding site pocket. A successful inhibitor may need to have an ability to relocate the loop from the entrance to bind to the catalytic pocket. However, mutations leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of the loop, while not affecting the folding of the protein, may result in the putative inhibitors' inability to access the binding pocket and provide a probable development of drug resistance. To avoid that situation that the future evolution of the Mpros can wipe out all our efforts, we should focus on key functional residues or those whose further mutation will destabilise the protein.
