Local population mobility for a city includes both intra-city and inter-city patterns. The inter-city mobility can be categorized into three sources, i.e., from Wuhan, from Hubei province (excluding Wuhan), and from cities outside Hubei. As nearly two-thirds of population outflow from Wuhan flooded into other cities within Hubei Province 13 , it is important to consider the population outflow from Hubei (excluding Wuhan) as a potentially significant source of epidemic transmission risk after 23 January 17 . The intra-city population movement is also an essential factor -research shows cities that introduced pre-emptive intra-city movement restrictions have 33.3% fewer confirmed cases in the first week of the epidemic outbreak compared to those that started restrictions after the emerging of confirmed cases 6 , pointing to the importance of the timing of introducing these measures. For inter-city population movement among cities outside Hubei, which are restricted after the Wuhan lockdown, different studies hold inconsistent views. On the one hand, the implementation of inter-city travel restrictions cannot significantly reduce the number of confirmed cases during the first week of city outbreaks 6 ; on the other hand, the transmission model of COVID-19 cannot be accurately established without the inter-city connections 19 .",

Based on the mobility change caused by the implementation of restrictions, we estimated the impact of local travel restrictions in cities outside Hubei (Fig. 1) -outside of the Wuhan lockdown -on control of the epidemic. Given that the three mobility patterns, except the population outflow from Wuhan, are heavily influenced by policy measures introduced by the central and local governments, such investigation is important in evaluating the effectiveness of and understanding the influence of the timing of different measures, which can in turn inform policy interventions in the future.",

In Stage One, the coefficients between the population inflow from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei and the number of confirmed cases (r=0.717 and 0.739 respectively, p<0.01) are higher than those of population migration from cities outside Hubei and than intra-city population movement (r=0.650 and 0.597 respectively, p<0.01), indicating the leading role of imported cases in this time period. In Stage Two, the correlations between mobility patterns and the number of confirmed cases (r<0.5, p<0.01) weaken compared to those in Stage One (r>0.55, p<0.01), suggesting the effects of mobility on epidemic spread might be reduced due to local travel restrictions. Meanwhile, the relationship between population migration from cities outside Hubei and intra-city population movement changes from highly correlated (r=0.812, p<0.01) to moderately correlated (r=0.465, p<0.01), implying the different strictness of inter-city and intra-city travel bans. The best-fitting linear regression models for epidemic development in both Stage One and Stage Two are listed in Table 2 . In Stage One, three inter-city mobility patterns, together with the number of initial confirmed cases, could explain 73.3% of the inter-city differences in newly reported infections in cities outside Hubei. The intra-city population movement figure is highly correlated with the inflow from cities outside Hubei (r=0.812, p<0.01), but its impact on the local epidemic development is less than the inter-city scenario. This result implies the existence of imported cases from cities outside Hubei. In Stage Two, intra-city population movement and the number of initial confirmed cases could explain 51.0% of the inter-city differences in newly reported infections in cities outside Hubei.

Therefore, we adopted the mobility scale of 2019 and mobility direction of 2020 to simulate the population mobility after 23 January 2020, when there were no local travel restrictions. The daily population inflow from Hubei (excluding Wuhan), population inflow from cities outside Hubei, and intra-city population movement after 3 February 2019, aligned by the Chinese lunar calendar with 23 January 2020, were used as proxy mobility data for the no-localtravel-restrictions status in cities outside Hubei.",

Before 30 January, cities successively suspended their inter-provincial transport to and from Hubei (Supplementary Table 1) , and restricted their inter-city and their intra-city population movement to varying degrees 6 . That is to say, the inter-city and intra-city population movements were all limited after 30 January. We assume all travel restrictions in cities outside Hubei were imposed at the same time as the Wuhan lockdown. Thus, the population outflow from Hubei excluding Wuhan solely considered those on 23 January. The population inflow from other cities and intra-city population movement from 31 January-6 February replaced those from 23-30 January as proxy mobility data for the timely travel restrictions status.",

More timely travel bans would further decrease the number of confirmed cases in the same period by 15.7% (95% PI:15.4%-16.0%) or 1,378 (95% PI: 1,353-1,402) cases. Therefore, besides the lockdown of one epidemic city, the timely implementation of travel restrictions -including both inter-city and intra-city travel bans -in other cities can effectively control the COVID-19 outbreak. If the whole of Hubei province was not quarantined after the Wuhan lockdown, further national seeding and subsequent infections might have become inevitable. By 12 March 2020, Hubei (excluding Wuhan) has more confirmed cases (17,795) than China excluding Hubei (13,032) 24 .Our results suggest that in cities outside Hubei, the travel restriction of Hubei (excluding Wuhan) is more effective than other inter-city and intra-city travel bans in controlling the development of the epidemic in the two weeks after the Wuhan lockdown. On January 26, all airports and railway stations in Hubei were closed25 . Before January 30, all other provinces in mainland China suspended their inter-provincial road transport to and from Hubei (SupplementaryTable 1), quarantining the whole of Hubei Province. Although these travel restrictions reduced the number of confirmed cases in cities outside Hubei by 15.8% (95% PI: 11.6%-20.0%) of reported cases in the two weeks after the Wuhan lockdown, another 10.5% (95% PI: 10.2-10.7%) might have been prevented by a more timely quarantine of the whole Hubei province (Supplementary",

The contribution of population movement from Wuhan or Hubei to subsequent epidemic development might also be dampened due to the implementation of source control measures 7 . Without the implementation of combined source control measures, our study, at least in the model of Stage Two, might have different results. Our study quantified the relationships between mobility patterns and epidemic trajectory in China and highlighted the importance of synchronized travel restrictions across cities. Several policy implications can be drawn. First, the geographical extension of the quarantine should be carefully considered by the government before the official announcement. In the early stage of epidemic development, there might be a non-negligible number of infected but undetected people in the areas that have geographical connections and frequent traffic with the epidemicstricken ones, like other cities in Hubei. In particular, there are many asymptomatic virus carriers who are highly contagious 23,28 . On the other hand, the expansion of the quarantined area would also bring substantial economic losses. Whether to include farther hinterlands, and if so to what extent, will need to be considered carefully in making the quarantine decision.

First, Pearson correlation analysis was applied to check whether different mobility patterns were correlated with the spread of COVID-19 in cities outside Hubei in two time periods. Correlated data would be introduced to the following linear regression. Second, stepwise multivariate linear regressions were built to explore the explanatory capacity of mobility data to the number of confirmed cases. A model with the highest adjusted R 2 was taken as the best-fit scenario. Cities without confirmed cases until the end of each stage were excluded from the study. Besides, for all the cities with confirmed cases after the Wuhan >0), we also generated models for cities with \u202b\u0725(\u202c >0) in Stage One to identify the impact of the same mobility pattern on different kinds of cities.
