Fourthly, virus infected megakaryocyte sheds platelets that presenting viral antigens, so anti-viral antibodies attack against platelets. Animal models with Rauscher virus infection showed viral gp70 antigen expression on platelets correlated with the development of delayed-phase thrombocytopenia [22] . On this ground, treatment using immunoregulatory agents (including intravenous immunoglobulin [IVIG] and dexamethasone) is reasonable and necessary. IVIG was administered to all these three patients thereafter and proved to be effective in 2 to 3 days. A Zika virus-infected patient suffered severe thrombocytopenia 29 days after illness onset. She was treated as presumed immune-mediated thrombocytopenia with IVIG and her platelets recovered in a few days [18] .",
