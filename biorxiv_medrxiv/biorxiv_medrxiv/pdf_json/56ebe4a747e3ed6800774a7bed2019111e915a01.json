We previously showed that our Organ Chips can recapitulate human organ physiology, disease states, and therapeutic responses to clinically relevant drug pharmacokinetic (PK) exposures with high fidelity 4-8 . Here we show how human lung Airway Chips may be used to model human lung responses to viral infection in vitro, and in concert with higher throughput cell-based assays, to identify existing approved drugs that have the potential to be repurposed for treating or preventing spread of viral pandemics caused by influenza as well as the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is the cause of the current COVID-19 crisis.",

Cell lines and even human cells grown in conventional cultures do not exhibit the highly differentiated tissue structures and functions seen in living human organs. Explant cultures of human respiratory tract tissue circumvent this limitation, but their availability is limited and their viability can only be maintained for short time (4-10 days) 11 .

Moreover, in all of these culture models, drug studies are carried out under static conditions that cannot predict human responses to clinically relevant, dynamic drug exposure (PK) profiles. Importantly, while animal models are currently used as the benchmark for validation of therapeutics, they are not natural hosts for influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2, and when infection is possible, they commonly exhibit different systemic clinical manifestations from humans; husbandry requirements are also complex and expensive, and the ethics of using of non-human primates is garnering increasing concern even by NIH 12 .

This device supports differentiation of the lung airway basal stem cells into a mucociliary, pseudostratified epithelium with proportions of airway-specific cell types (ciliated cells, mucus-producing goblet cells, club cells, and basal cells) (Fig. S1A) , as well as establishment of continuous ZO1-containing tight junctions and cilia (Fig. 1B) , permeability barrier properties, and levels of mucus production (Fig. S1B ,C) similar to those observed in human airway in vivo 13 , as well as in prior Airway Chip studies that used a membrane with smaller pores (0.4 \u00b5m vs. the 7 \u00b5m diameter used here) that did not permit immune cell transmigration 6,7 . The underlying human pulmonary microvascular endothelium also formed a continuous planar cell monolayer with cells linked by VE-cadherin containing adherens junctions (Fig. 1B) as it does in vivo. Importantly, the highly differentiated airway epithelium in the Airway Chip expresses higher levels of multiple serine proteases including TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, TMPRSS11D and TMPRSS11E (DESC1) compared to MDCK cells that are often used to study influenza infection in vitro (Fig. 1C) ; these proteases are essential for the activation and propagation of influenza viruses in vivo. In addition, differentiation of the airway cells at an ALI on-chip is accompanied by large increases in protein (Fig. 1D) and mRNA expression levels of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) (Fig. 1D,E) , as well as the TMPRSS2 protease (Fig. 1F) , which are also required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 14 . author/funder.

Significantly less infection was detected in undifferentiated airway basal epithelium prior to culture at an ALI on-chip, and there was no detectable direct infection of the endothelium by the virus (Fig. S2A) . Interestingly, however, influenza infection led to disruption of the lung endothelium on-chip, as evidenced by loss of VE-cadherin containing adherens junctions (Fig. 1B) (10 3 -to 10 4 -fold) increases in viral titers over 24 to 48 hours in highly differentiated human lung airway epithelium on-chip ( Fig. 2A) . Notably, the H3N2 virus strains (HK/68 and Pan/99) exhibited ~10-fold greater replication efficiency than the H1N1 virus strains (PR8, WSN, and NL/09) ( Fig. 2A) and caused more barrier function damage (Fig. 1G) and cilia loss (Fig. S2B) , which replicates the finding that H3N2 is more infectious and virulent, and causes more severe clinical symptoms in humans 16 .

When primary human neutrophils were perfused through the vascular channel of Airway Chips infected with H1N1 or H3N2, we observed recruitment of these circulating immune cells to the apical surface of the activated lung endothelium within minutes ( Fig. 2B top, Supplementary Movie 2) . This was followed by transmigration of the neutrophils through the endothelium and the ECM-coated pores of the intervening membrane, and up into the airway epithelium over hours (Fig. 2B bottom) . The neutrophils targeted the influenza nucleoprotein (NP)-positive infected airway cells (Fig.   S3 ) and induced them to coalesce into clusters that decreased in size over time, resulting in clearance of the viruses, as evidenced by the disappearance of GFPpositive cells over a period of 1-2 days (Fig. 2B bottom) . Consistent with the ability of H3N2 virus to induce stronger inflammation relative to H1N1 in vivo 16 , H3N2 also stimulated more neutrophil recruitment than H1N1 on-chip (Fig. 2C) , and neutrophil infiltration into the epithelium significantly decreased the viral titers of both H1N1 and H3N2 on-chip (Fig. 2D) , consistent with the protective role that neutrophils provide by clearing virus in vivo 17 . H1N1 infection also was accompanied by increased secretion of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IP-10, RANTES, interferon-\u03b2, and MCP-1, which could easily be measured in the effluent from the vascular channel (Fig. 2E) . author/funder.

Interestingly, chloroquine did not produce statistically significant inhibition effects when administered at its Cmax in the human Airway Chip (Fig. 4B) .

Organ Chips could be particularly useful for identifying existing approved drugs that may be repurposed for pandemic virus applications in crisis situations such as we face today that require accelerated development of potential therapeutic and prophylactic interventions. For example, our work on repurposing of COVID19 therapeutics was initiated on January 13, 2020 (one day after the sequence was published 21 ), and our first results with drugs in Airway Chips were obtained 3 weeks later. One limitation of human Organ Chips is that they are a relatively low throughput model (12 chips can be run per automated culture instrument; 2-3 instruments per incubator) and it can take 2-3 weeks to differentiate the airway epithelium under an ALI on-chip before experiments can be initiated; however, the level of mimicry of human lung physiology and pathophysiology is extremely high as shown previously 6,7 and in the present study with various strains of infectious influenza virus. Established cell lines currently used in virology studies, such as the Huh-7 cells used here, offer a higher throughput approach for rapid screening, but they do not exhibit features of a functional human lung epithelium. Thus, a more effective discovery pipeline can be created by combining these approaches.",
