However, the effectiveness of different policies and their relative impact vis-a-vis that of mechanisms driven by public awareness and voluntary actions have not been studied. This is crucial since in most places we observe significant reductions in social interaction before any policy was implemented. Variations in types and effective dates of different social distancing policies across different states in the US create a natural experiment to study the causal impact of each policy during the early stage of the outbreak. Using these policy variations and the aggregate human mobility and location trends published by Google for the month of March 2020, we employ a quasi-experimental approach to measure the impact of six common policies on people's presence at home and their mobility in different types of public places.",

However, the relative impact of social-awareness versus policy interventions is yet to be determined for the existing outbreak. In addition, several complementary policies were adopted to increase social distancing, some of which might have unintended consequences. Therefore, identifying effective policies could help policymakers respond efficiently to the outbreak. In most cases, decoupling these factors is challenging, since, in most countries, the timing and strength of NPI are highly correlated with public awareness. Moreover, it is crucial to determine which interventions have a significant impact on lowering the contact rate beyond what can be achieved via awareness mechanisms. Furthermore, the evaluation of these policies could provide valuable lessons, especially for the states that have not yet adopted these policies.",

In the United States and as of this writing, the federal government has left NPI decisions to individual states, creating a high level of variation in the type and timing of such policies 7 (See Figure 1 in the Data Section). While there are strong evidences for reduced social contact in the US, not all these reductions can be attributed to NPIs. In fact, mobility data show that people in most states had already started to reduce the time they spend outside of home before any NPI was implemented (See Figure AP.1 in the appendix).In fact, for some states such as Idaho, Missouri, Wyoming and the District of Columbia, people's presence at home had already increased close to a level of saturation before any social distancing policy went into effect. These pieces of evidence suggest that attributing current reductions in social interaction to policy measures can be misleading and further underscore the need for a formal study to disentangle the direct impact of NPIs from other factors such as awareness and spillover effects.",

These data were publicly released on April 2, 2020, in a form of charts that plot country-specific mobility trends and the percentage of changes with respect to a baseline in the period of Feb 16 to March 29. The US data also include mobility trends at the level of states and counties. Given that most intervention policies are implemented state-wide, we base our analysis at the state level. Each movement trend includes multiple data points per day. We aggregated these points to get a single mobility index per day for each trend chart.

Besides encouraging people to stay at home, social distancing policies also intend on keeping people away from crowded locations and large gatherings, even when they go out. We use the impact of policies on the changes in the remaining five location categories (i.e. retail, transit stations, parks ,and work places).

We considered the effective date as the first day in which the policy in question has been in full effect, acknowledging that this decision creates potential biases since some states had policies that went into effect immediately, resulting in fractions of a day of policy that are missed in our data.

We calculated an aggregate daily temperature for each state by taking the average of daily temperatures of top 5 cities weighted by their populations.

The more crucial question is how and to what extent such reductions in different forms of social interaction impact the infection rate and disease mortality. This is especially important since the relationship between social interaction and the infection rate is not fully understood and is expected to be highly nonlinear with strong dependencies on the location in which such interactions take place (e.g. parks vs. retail stores). Tackling these questions based on positive cases require more reliable data on the number, location, and policies for infection testing, something that is not widely available in most US states at the time of this writing. This problem can be in part mitigated by analyzing the policy effect on the death cases. Given that the median time from infection to death is reported to be close to 17 days, and since many states have issued their stronger policies in the last week of March, this study needs to wait for now until enough reliable data are collected.",

At this stage, where changes in behavior are driven by a combination of policy forces and voluntary actions, our results help us rank NPIs based on the strength and significance of their impact, beyond what has already been achieved through voluntary actions. Specifically, our results show that the tendency to remain at home is driven strongly by the statewide stay-home order and moderately by non-essential business closure and policies related to restaurant and bar limits. Other policies such as school closure mandate, large gatherings bans, and more limited stay-home orders do not show any significant impact on keeping people at home. Furthermore, statewide stay-home orders have a strong and significant impact on reducing mobility in all outside home place categories. The effectiveness of non-essential business closure and restaurant/bar limits are also significant on most (but not all) place categories. Limited stay-home orders and large gathering ban do not show any impact on increasing presence at home or reducing mobility in other place categories. If anything, in the absence of other policies, a large gathering ban results in a moderate increase in mobility in transit stations. School closure mandate gives us a mixed picture, with no significant impact on presence at home and moderate, but significant impact on mobility in retail locations and transit stations. Finally, our Event study analysis further makes a stronger case for the causal nature of these findings. These results show that at the early stages of the pandemic much of the expected impact of some more lenient NPIs are reaped from other factors such as voluntary actions and awareness driven mechanisms. Thus, in order to achieve social distancing beyond what is gained through those mechanisms, states need to adopt strong interventions such as statewide stay-home order.",

We show that reductions in out-of-home social interactions are driven by a combination of policy and voluntary measures and point to the strong causal impact of state-wide stay at home and more moderate impact of non-essential business closures and bar/restaurant limits. At this stage of the outbreak and for the US, other policy measures such as school closure mandates or large gathering bans seem to have had no significant causal impact on keeping people at home. We need to be cautious when generalizing the results of this early stage of the pandemic to the later stages and to the possible future waves of the outbreak. Specifically, we need to emphasize that our results do not claim that more lenient social distancing policies such as school closure or large gathering bans are always causally inefficient in reducing social interaction. While it is evident that most of the social distancing capacity of such measures are already absorbed in non-policy driven changes -possibly caused by social awareness -, it is expected that as the pandemic lasts longer, voluntary social distancing measures start to wane, making such policies and a combination of them more effective in later stages of the pandemic 12 .",
