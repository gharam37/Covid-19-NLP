Prezcobix/Rezolsta is a fixed-dose combination of 800 mg of the HIV protease inhibitor darunavir (DRV) and 150 mg cobicistat, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, which is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection. There are currently no definitive data on the safety and efficacy of DRV/cobicistat for treatment of COVID-19. The in vitro antiviral activity of darunavir against a clinical isolate from a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 was assessed. DRV showed no activity against SARS-CoV-2 at clinically relevant concentrations (EC 50 >100 \u03bc M). Remdesivir, used as a positive control, showed potent antiviral activity (EC 50 = 0.38 \u03bc M). Overall, the data do not support the use of DRV for treatment of COVID-19. All rights reserved.

The potential for HIV PIs as a treatment for COVID-19 is mainly based on limited virologic and clinical data on the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir with low-dose ritonavir (as a pharmacoenhancer; LPV/r) in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome related to a coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (4) . After demonstrating the in vitro antiviral activity of LPV against SARS-CoV-1, the clinical response of patients with SARS to a combination of LPV/r and ribavirin was examined. Patients treated with LPV/r had lower rates of adverse clinical outcomes at day 21 following the onset of symptoms compared with historical controls (4). However, recent data in hospitalized adults with severe confirmed COVID-19 treated with LPV/r in addition to a standard care of ventilation, oxygen, vasopressor support, antibiotics and renalreplacement therapy showed that there was no significant improvement in time to clinical improvement or mortality at day 28 compared with the standard care (5).",

This cell culture assay was shown to be suitable for antiviral assays. Productive viral infection takes place in this model with the number of SARS-CoV RNA molecules increasing continuously after infection, indicating that the virus undergoes full replicatory cycles (12) . Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleotide analog initially developed for Ebola virus disease, has shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro with an EC 50 equal to 0,770 \u00b5M (13) and was therefore used as a positive control.",

Virus was added together with the compounds under investigation and incubated in MEM supplemented with 1% FBS. DRV and remdesivir were synthesized at Johnson & Johnson. To assess in vitro antiviral activity, DRV and remdesivir, diluted in MEM without FBS, were added in 4-fold dilutions to were then incubated for 48 hours before the cytopathogenic effect (CPE) was visually scored by two independent laboratory technicians. Evaluation of CPE was also done using an 3-(4,5-dimetiltiazol-2-il)-2,5-difeniltetrazolio (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich) method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Optic densities were measured at 560/620 nm in a Multiskan Reader MCC/340 Labsystems. Three independent experiments with triplicate measurements were performed.

Remdesivir showed potent antiviral activity with an (CC 50 / EC 50 ) for DRV could not be calculated (>100 \u00b5M / >100 \u00b5M for SARS-CoV-2) due to the lack of antiviral activity. In contrast, remdesivir had a selectivity index of >900 by visual CPE scoring and >260 by the MTT method, confirming a strong in vitro antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. Modelling In silico docking of DRV in the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CL protease) identified five docking poses. The docking scores ranged from S= -8.6 to -8.2, showing that DRV can fit into the pocket, but these values are indicative of suboptimal binding to this protein. Visual inspection of each of these poses showed very few interactions of DRVwith the active site of the protease, and the catalytic cysteine residue was not directly targeted, unlike the many strong interactions observed for DRV bound to the HIV protease(14).
