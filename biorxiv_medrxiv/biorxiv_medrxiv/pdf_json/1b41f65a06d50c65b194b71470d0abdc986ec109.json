It is found that the growth of the number of infected individuals N (t) can be modeled across different states with a simple linear function N (t) = \u03b3 +\u03b1t beyond the date when reasonable number of individuals were tested (and when a countrywide lockdown was imposed). The slope \u03b1 is different for different states. Following recent work by Notari (arxiv:2003.12417), we then consider the dependency of the \u03b1 for different states on the average maximum and minimum temperatures, the average relative humidity and the population density in each state. It turns out that like other countries, the parameter \u03b1, which determines the rate of rise of the number of infected individuals, seems to have a weak correlation with the average maximum temperature of the state. In contrast, any significant variation of \u03b1 with humidity or minimum temperature seems absent with almost no meaningful correlation. Expectedly, \u03b1 increases (slightly) with increase in the population density of the states; however, the degree of correlation here too is negligible. These results seem to barely suggest that a natural cause like a hot summer (larger maximum temperatures) may contribute towards reducing the transmission of the virus, though the role of minimum temperature, humidity and population density remains somewhat obscure from the inferences which may be drawn from presently available data.",

COVID-19, as the pandemic is technically called, is a highly infectious viral disease which first appeared in Wuhan in China in December 2019. Since then, containing the virus through studies of its transmission mechanism has been a subject of great interest. A central question along these lines is whether local climate (as embodied in the temperature and relative humidity at a given location) on Earth has any role to play in the existence, functional behaviour and transmission of this virus. It is true that apart from temperature or humidity, there could be many other factors as well which could contribute to an answer to this serious question.",

Nonetheless, weak correlation between the meteorological parameters (T max , T min and h) and the population density (\u03c1) do exist. In view of this, we fitted the data points in each panel in Figure 5 with a linear relation, \u03b1 = A + B \u00d7 x and with a polynomial relation \u03b1 = A + B \u00d7 x + C \u00d7 x 2 , with x as T max , T min , h or \u03c1. The best fit curves are shown by blue and red solid lines in Figure 5(a)-(d) , respectively. The degree of correlation (R 2 ), as obtained from the fitting procedures in each panel is shown in Table 1 . We find a weak correlation between the value of \u03b1 and the parameters x. The value of R 2 is relatively higher if one assumes polynomial relations between the slope (\u03b1) and T max , \u03c1 than if we consider a linear relation. In the fitting procedure, the data point for Maharashtra (shown by green symbol in each plot) is not included, as it lies much away from other data points. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

VARIATION OF SLOPE WITH AVERAGE MAXIMUM/MINUMUM TEM-PERATURES, HUMIDITY AND POPULATION DENSITYAs noted above, for all states, the sharp rise beyond the hump, till April 10, 2020 follows a nearly linear relation with the number of days, and could be fitted fairly well by a straight line, as shown more distinctly, for a few states inFigure 3. Next, we try to find if there is any correlation between the estimated slope and the mean maximum and minimum temperatures (T max , T min ) and humidity (h) of the states during this growth period. We have estimated the value of T max and T min of each state by taking the average of all corresponding recorded temperatures over the days in March-April when the first case was reported and till April 10, 2020. For example, in case of WB, the average of all maximum and minimum temperatures of all days from March 18 to April 10, 2020 are considered to estimate T max and T min . The data source for the weather parameters is the web portal Accuweather [22] and we note temperatures for the capital of each state (eg. Kolkata for WB). This, we believe, is not a bad approximation, as most of the Covid-19 cases are reported from the capital cities, rather than from remote villages. The variation of the slope with the T max and T min and the expected humidity (h) for the states over the rise period are shown inFigure 5(a)-(c), respectively. Figure 5(d) plots the variation of the slope with the population density (\u03c1) of the states as per Census 2011 [23]. The data (on population density) is available in the web portal of the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner, India, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India.",
