Its main protease (M pro ) represents an attractive pharmacological target due to its involvement in essential viral functions. The crystal structure of free M pro shows a large structural resemblance with the main protease of CoV-1. Here we report that CoV-2 M pro is however 300% more sensitive than CoV-1 M pro in transmitting tiny structural changes across the whole protein through long-range interactions. The largest sensitivity of M pro to structural perturbations is located exactly around the catalytic site Cyst-145, and coincides with the binding site of several of its inhibitors. These findings, based on a simplified representation of the protein as a residue network, may help in designing potent inhibitors of CoV-2 M pro . : bioRxiv preprint",

This disease-produced by a new coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 [3] -has become pandemic in about three months, affecting more than 200 countries around the world. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus [4, 5] , to which the virus which produced the respiratory epidemic of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) also belongs to. The new coronavirus shares about 82% of its genome with CoV-1. In spite of this similarity and of the fact that SARS-CoV-1 appeared almost 20 years ago, there are currently no approved specific drugs against SARS-CoV-2 [6, 7, 8, 9] . In consequence, most of the clinical treatment used against the disease is symptomatic in combination with some repurposed drugs, such as the antiviral Remdesivir or the antimalarials chloquine [10] and hidroxychloroquine [11] . This situation urges the scientific community to search for specific antiviral therapeutics and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.",

Thus, inhibiting the activity of M pro would result in blocking viral replication. This protein does not exist in humans, which makes it attractive for avoiding possible toxicities of anti-CoV-2 drugs. The three-dimensional structure of CoV-2 M pro has been resolved by Zhang et al. at 1.75\u00c5 of resolution [15] . They also reported the structure of CoV-2 M pro with an \u03b1-ketoamide inhibitor in two different space groups.

They share 96% of amino acids sequence, i.e., they differ in the amino acids at only 12 out of 303 positions in the sequence. More remarkable the root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation between the two three-dimensional structures is only 0.53 \u00c5 for all C \u03b1 positions. It seems like the two proteases are almost identical in their three-dimensional structures. The first question that emerges here is whether such similarities are also reflected at the topological structural level of the proteins. By topological we mean here the discrete topology emerging from a network theoretic representation of a protein. In this representation of the protein structure the nodes of the network represent amino acids and the edges connecting them indicate that the corresponding residues are at a distance in which they can interact to each other. Because the Euclidean distance between the amino acids is used to construct the network we more correctly should refer to this framework as topographical more than topological. This network theoretic representation has been previously used to answer several questions related to protein structure and functioning [18, 19, 20, 21, 22] . Among the tools in use, the one of node centrality [23, 24] has played a fundamental role (see for instance [22] . These indices capture the relative importance-both structural and dynamical-of an individual amino acid in the protein.",

We then analyze the similarities in the topological structure of CoV-2 M pro with that of CoV-1 for which we also construct the corresponding PRN. We then show that both proteases are very similar in relation to a few topological characteristics which account for a very close environment around the amino acids. That is, when the descriptors used account for the locality of the topological environment of a residue the two proteases do not differ in more than 4%. However, when the descriptors considered account for wider environments around the nodes the difference between the two proteins can increase up to 10%. These descriptors quantify how a perturbation at an amino acid is transmitted through the whole structure to the rest of the residues in the protein. When this transmission is allowed not only between close pairs of amino acids but also between very distant ones, the difference between the two proteases increases up to 300%. That is, CoV-2 M pro is 300% more sensitive to the transmission of perturbations between amino acids through the topological structure of the protein than CoV-1 M pro . We discovered that the residues with this largest sensitivity in CoV-2 M pro are the ones involved in the binding of the three inhibitors studied here. That is, the most central amino acids according to this long-range indices are also the most affected by the interaction with the inhibitors as they are either in the binding site or very close to it. Consequently, we have discovered that the most relevant amino acids from the topological point of view are also the most relevant ones for the binding of some inhibitors to the CoV-2 M pro and should play an important role in the design of drugs inhibiting this protease.",

The amino acid sequence of both proteases share 96% of similarity, i.e., only 12 amino acids are different in both proteases of a total of 303. These amino acids are at positions 33 [25] ). Then, it is not surprising that most of the topological characteristics of the first kind of the PRNs of both proteases are very similar with relative differences not bigger than 4% for all the properties analyzed except for the degree heterogeneity. In this case, the relative difference is 8.61% between both proteases, showing that that of CoV-2 is more heterogeneous than the one of CoV-1 (see Table 1 ). However, the values of this parameter are very close to zero in both cases (the degree heterogeneity index is bounded between zero and one), which indicate that both networks are poorly heterogeneous and look more like regular graphs. In fact, both networks have almost normal degree distributions and the main difference is that for CoV-1 about 27% of the nodes have degree 5, while for CoV-2 about 32% have degree 4. We then continue the analysis by comparing the topological descriptors of the second kind. We notice that neither the eigenvector centrality, which has been found very useful in previous analysis of PRN [22] , nor the communicability angles, which account for the communication efficiency of the PRN, display any significant difference between both proteases. However, there are differences in the mean subgraph centrality of about 6% and of the average communicability between pairs of nodes of more than 10%. In both cases, the indices are significantly larger for the protease of CoV-2 than for that of CoV-1. This means that the 12 punctual mutations that make the difference between the proteases of CoV-1 and CoV-2 increase the capacity of the individual amino acids of feeling a perturbation or thermal oscillation produced in another amino acid of the protein. As we have previously explained these communicability factors penalizes very heavily any perturbation being transmitted between two amino acids separated by a relatively long distance in the protein. Thus, they can be considered as a indices that account for shorter range interactions than the third kind descriptors considered here.",

In this case the increase of these indices is more than 280% for the LR communicability and more than 300% for the LR subgraph centrality. In short, this means that the protease of CoV-2 has almost 4 times more capacity of transmitting perturbations between pairs of nodes than the protease of CoV-1. This is equivalent to say that the protease of CoV-2 is significantly much more topologically efficient in transmitting \"information\" among its amino acids than the protease of CoV-1. And, such efficiency has been obtained only with 12 punctual mutations! We now proceed to the analysis of the local variation of the subgraph and the LR subgraph centralities for the amino acids of the two M pro (see Fig. 2 ). In the case of the subgraph centrality the largest change is produced for a few amino acids which increase their centrality in CoV-2 relative to CoV-1. These are the cases of 27, 205, 202, 295, 290, and143 . But there are also other amino acids which drop their centrality in CoV-2, such as 172, 225, 234, 171, and 235among others (see Fig. 2 (b)). Therefore, the increase of the subgraph centrality of a few amino acids makes that in total the average subgraph centrality increases in CoV-2 in relation to CoV-1. An important characteristic feature of the differences in this centrality between the two proteases is that they are spread across the three domains of the proteases with a large increment in the domains I and III. This is a major difference with the LR subgraph centrality (see Figs. 2(c) and (d)), where the main change is a dramatic increase in the centrality of the nodes in the domains I and II of the CoV-2 protease relative to CoV-1.

In Fig. 8 we illustrate the subgraphs having the 22 most central amino acids according to this topological feature. As can be seen both subgraphs are connected and have edge densities 0.33 (6W63) and 0.31 (6LU7). In the case of 6W63 21 out of 22 amino acids are the same found as the most central ones in 6Y2E according to this index. For 6LU7 16 out of 22 of the amino acids with the largest deviations of the LR subgraph centrality coincide with the most central ones in the free CoV-2 M pro . In both cases, these residues are in the binding site of CoV-2 M pro or very close to it, indicating that the functional importance of them coincides with their topological relevance in the PRN. An interesting difference between the responses of the CoV-2 M pro to the inhibitors in 6W63 and 6LU7 is that in the first the centrality of the nodes after binding is smaller than in the free protease. Although the free protease 6Y2E and the one bounded to inhibitor 6W63 are solved at different resolutions we point out that this behavior is similar to the one observed for 6Y2G. However, in the case of 6LU7 the response of the amino acids after binding with inhibitor is an increment of their centrality, which is equivalent to a more compactness of this region of the protein and of the whole protein itself.

            "text": "We present an analysis of some of the most relevant topological properties of the main protease of the SARS CoV-2. Our approach is based on the representation of the three-dimensional structure of the protein as a residue network in which C \u03b1 of every amino acid is represented by a node of the network and two nodes are connected if the corresponding C \u03b1 are at no more than 7.0 \u00c5. CoV-2 M pro differs only in 12 punctual mutations from CoV-1 M pro and the superposition of their three-dimensional skeletons gives an r. m. s. of only 0.53 \u00c5. Then, it comes at no surprise that the difference between most of the topological properties of the PRNs representing both proteases differ in less than 5%. If we exclude from the analysis the LR descriptors, then 70% of the topological descriptors shows only a small variation between the two proteases. In this situation it is certainly remarkable that there are topological descriptors which change in about 300% from one protease to the other. These are the cases of the LR subgraph centrality of the amino acids and of the LR communicability between pairs of them. The increase of these parameters in about 300% for CoV-2 M pro relative to CoV-1 M pro means that the 12 punctual mutations that differentiate both proteases have created a huge increment in the efficiency of CoV-2 M pro in transmitting perturbations of any kind between the amino acids of the protein using all available routes of connection and allowing for long-distance transmission. To make clearer what this sensitivity means we are going to use a simple example. Let us consider a tiny perturbation on the structure of the proteases which prevent the interaction between the amino acids P9 and G11, which have been selected at random. In CoV-1 M pro these amino acids are at 5.69 \u00c5 and in CoV-2 M pro they are 6.48 \u00c5 apart. Thus, in both cases they are connected in the corresponding PRN. Let us consider that the perturbation remove this edge from the PRN of both proteases. The relative decrement of the average path length in CoV-2 M pro relative to CoV-1 M pro is almost imperceptible, i.e., 5.7%. In the case of the subgraph centrality it is of the same order, i.e., 3.4%. This means that according to these parameters CoV-2 M pro is as sensitive as CoV-1 M pro to perceive a structural change in its structure produced by a given perturbation. However, when we consider the LR subgraph centrality this relative change is 316.8%. That is, according to this topological parameter which takes into account long-range interactions, CoV-2 M pro is more than three times more sensitive to a tiny structural change than CoV-1 M pro . This remarkable finding indicates that the 12 mutations produced in CoV-1 M pro makes the resulting CoV-2 M pro much more efficient in transmitting \"information\" through the protein skeleton using short and longrange routes.",

One of the amino acids which has increased more dramatically its sensitivity to long-range transmission of information in CoV-2 M pro is Cys-145, which is one of the two catalytic sites of the protease, and the one involved in interactions with the inhibitors, such as the ones analyzed here. We have analyzed here three different inhibitors of CoV-2 M pro . In the three cases we have observed a significant variation in the LR subgraph centrality of the amino acids which were previously observed to have increased their LR sensitivity in the free protease. Therefore, these amino acids corresponds to those involved in the binding of these three inhibitors, showing that their increased topological role in the CoV-2 M pro also may play an important functional role in it.",

In this sense the PRN represents a simplified model of the three-dimensional structure of the protein. Typically, such simplification in the complexity of the representation of systems convey a loss in the structural information which is represented by the global system. In this case, however, we have shown that the use of a network representation of the proteins reveals some hidden patterns in their structure that were escaping to the analysis by using the global structure. To detect such important structural factors it is necessary to account for longrange interactions among the amino acids of the proteases, which are the ones revealing the their most important characteristics in terms of their sensitivity to tiny structural changes produced by local or global perturbations to the system. Such LR interactions revealed here the main differences between the proteases of CoV-1 and CoV-2, as well as the most important amino acids for the interaction with inhibitors, which may produce therapeutic candidates against COVID-19.",

The relation of this index with walks is given by the following. Let N k (i) be the number of walks of length k starting at node i and ending elsewhere. Then, if the network is not bipartite, which is the case of the current work, EC i = lim k\u2192\u221e N k (i)/ \u2211 n j=1 N k (j) (see Chapter 5 in [23] ). That is, the eigenvector centrality of a node is the ratio of the number of walks of infinite length that start at this node to the whole number of such walks starting elsewhere. Consequently, the average eigenvector centrality \u27e8EC\u27e9, accounts for the spread of information from the nodes beyond the nearest neighbors and using any infinite-length walk in the graph. A type of descriptors of the second kind are based on counting all walks of any length, but giving more weight to the shorter than to the longer ones. These descriptors are based on the following matrix function: G := \u2211 \u221e k=0 A k k! = exp (A), where exp (A) is the exponential of the matrix. then, we consider the average of the diagonal entries of this matrix, which is known as the average subgraph centrality \u27e8SC\u27e9 = 1 n \u2211 n p=1 G pp [33] , which accounts for the participation of the corresponding node in all subgraphs of the graphs, giving more weight to the shortest than to the longer ones.

The third category of descriptors is formed by all-walks indices that penalize less heavily longer walks connecting pairs of nodes in a network. That is, although G = exp (A) accounts for all walks connecting every pair of nodes, it penalizes very much those walks of relatively large length, then making more emphasis in shorter walks around a given node. In order to include longer walks in the analysis we study the following matrix function [36] :",

In a similar way we consider \u27e8Z ij \u27e9 = 2 n (n \u2212 1) \u2211 i,j Z ij , which accounts for the global capacity of the network of transmitting information between pairs of nodes and allowing longer-range transmission than in the case of the communicability.
