            "text": "This paper analyzes the stability and usefulness of a human-in-the-loop caseload management method for COVID-19. This can control the balance between medical resource utilization and economic shutdown duration across significant scenario variation. It reduce the total cases by controlling the rate of spreading as groups cross the herd immunity threshold, and suggests late intervention has more effect on total cases than early intervention once containment has failed. Data as of April 11, 2020 show that \"flattening\" strategy for COVID-19 in both the world and the U.S. is working so well that a significantly effective removal of social distancing (aka \"unlock\") at any time in the next few years, other than after widespread and effective vaccination, will produce a rebound overloading the healthcare system. For the world, by early April flattening was working so well that a world rebound could be projected in 2021 that would exceed in critical demand even the additional million or so ventilators requested by world governments. In the U.S., whose trajectory is somewhat ahead of the world, the projected rebound of a late year unlock is already greater than the current crisis projected peak. Most citizens are tacitly expecting much sooner rather than much later unlocks. Leaving economies locked down for a long time is its own catastrophe, especially for countries that cannot provide substantial economic aid to their citizens. An SIR-type model was used with clear parameters suitable for public information, and both tracking and predictive capabilities, and an additional simulation of a decision-maker on selected-day partial unlock designed mainly to manage ventilator or other critical resource utilization, to make sure they are neither idle nor over committed. Using certain days of the week, already practiced by some countries, is not a necessary part of the method, but was used in the simulation to give a highly quantified unlock scheme. It also helps restore economic activity. While the model shows total cumulative cases, and therefore deaths, declining initially with flattening, when flattening begins to produce large rebounds the death rate goes back up. Partial unlock to manage critical resources brings the cumulative cases down about 8-12% between now and the second half of 2021, and therefore saves lives with some degree of certainty. (for all needs not just COVID-19), and (3) reduce the social and economic impact of the pandemic [1] . It is generally conceded that the effort is failing catastrophically on the third count, social and economic impact. The natural cycle of COVID-19 without intervention we will show would have ended by late July with only one month of effective shutdown while more than 20% of the world population was simultaneously ill. Current strategies guarantee a high degree of economic and travel shutdown for nearly two years even if vaccine development is successful, which we will also show. Perhaps more troubling for the long run, governments are now considering COVID I.D. cards to identify those with immunity, who will be permitted to travel and work, while enforcing a kind of mandatory quarantine on innocent and socially compliant citizens, as well as totalitarian-like individual monitoring and tracking.",

Economic losses from pandemics, even without a long term global shutdown, have been estimated at the low end of but within the range of impacts from climate change [4] . These historical analyses are likely to vastly underestimate the impact from the economic and social disruption of COVID-19.

Most regions or entities lock down in proportion to cases. Instead of taking control of the situation from the pathogen as intended, by the implicit dependence of strategy on cases this hands control right back to the pathogen, and we will show this assures the survival of the pathogen long into the future, as it decays very slowly under heavy lockdown. Even at current case levels which are far below those anticipated in the near future, fear-based shutdown as evidenced by traffic reductions in cities that have no shutdown may be nearing its maximum potential. Figure 1 shows world cases, normalized to 1.0 on March 21, and the replication rate of the pathogen R0 defined in terms of new cases, active cases, and the average length of cases. R0 appears to correlate well with a damped exponential function given in the figure. While lockdowns began to be enforced outside China from late January, they were initially selective and directed at international travel. By mid-March they were widespread. We would expect a few days delay before a reduction in R0 would appear in the new cases data (largely taken from the CDC, with supplementary data from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ ). Prior to March 21 the US cases were doubling every two days for about a week. This quickly declined following March 21, so that date was chosen as the start date for our tracking and modeling. Any method of caseload management must affect the replication rate, and act quickly enough to provide control authority without overshoot. The chart suggests case data from changes in lockdown of a week or slightly less. It further suggests the initial reaction was primarily due to the rules and recommendations. Lockdowns were mostly in place by the end of March. On the other hand, traffic surveys of cities with no lockdown showed substantial reduction in traffic without lockdown, perhaps 70-80%, and that traffic had already plummeted in other cities prior to lockdown (see https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51235105 ). Taking the damped exponential correlation as a possible predictor, effectiveness of lockdown has nearly reached maximum. It is possible there would be little response if governments eased lockdown, unless they also declared the environment safe, which isn't true any time soon. However, as economic distress builds, coupling easing with the ability to work would likely be a powerful motivator.",

In our simulation we simply establish a percentage of R0 recovery to the initial level of March 21, and to provide an additional degree of control we allow the activity that results in this R0 rebound to occur on selected days of the week. We simulate a decision maker with access to week-old data, who would decide what days of the week would be partially unlocked. This demonstrates that even a crude on/off level of control is adequate. Our per day effectiveness ranges from 20% to 60%, with lower numbers used early on, and larger numbers when herd immunity is reducing R0 and it needs more of a push to progress toward herd immunity and is not in danger of exploding and overloading the healthcare system. In a real world implementation, the simulated unlock manager is replaced by humans looking at new cases data, and from that calculating future ventilator utilization. New cases data should in turn lag their decisions by no more than a week. Our simulations will attempt to show that in a variety of scenarios, over a range of disease parameters, whatever happens the managers will have control authority to accomplish their goal. One thing we cannot do with epidemiological \"trajectory\" models is plan the whole thing out in advance, because tiny changes in R0, often due to behavior, make large changes in future caseload in the future. What we demonstrate instead is that it is possible by making decisions in the future to accommodate those changes in intrinsic R0 and counter them, even with measurement lag in the system. The unlock managers and policy makers must determine what actual social distancing measures correspond to the desired percent of unlock by empirical means. The original goal of this research was just to assure that the constraint of medical resources could be met while reducing economic impact. It was an unexpected discovery that under realistic scenarios, such as a world unlock approximately a year from now, cases and presumably deaths would be reduced by as much as 8-12% as compared to simpler lockdown release strategies, or a long lockdown that results in social unrest.",

The intent of the easing advocated in this paper is to quantitatively manage caseload, including increasing caseload when it is too low to effectively utilize available resources, reduce economic distress, and prevent deadly rebounds later this year or next year. To actually study the parameters and determine how to use them in detail, download the spreadsheet and read the short user guide embedded within it.

When an \"unlock\" policy is established in the predictive model, the reproductive factor is biased toward the initial value and proportioned toward the last data-derived reproductive factor according to the unlock effectiveness. Then it is reduced by the herd immunity factor. Calibrating unlock effectiveness, i.e. what policy will have what percentage unlock effect, is an important activity that is left to the user and local authorities.",

Only part of it is due to the unknown cases. There are differences in the care provided, not only from place to place, but over time as things are learned about treating the disease. Currently the mortality in known cases seems, based in CDC and other published data, to be running around 2.7-3% of known cases, just under the number on ventilators (in many countries including the US survival rates post-ventilation are low). In countries where it is practical, now forewarned, more vulnerable individuals can isolate themselves no matter what the unlock policy is, and the effect will be to reduce that rate. If we assume this effect, along with better treatment, reduces the mortality to 1.2%, then the mortality among all not just known cases, assuming a ration of 6, is 1.2/6 = 0.2%. We use this conservative number to avoid overestimating the number of lives potentially saved by utilizing our method. The number of deaths by this method for Figure 7 is 0.2% of 64% of 7.5 billion or 9.6 million direct deaths from disease. Some estimates will range more than twice that much.",

The total cases are 76%, 8% higher, or a difference of conservatively 1.2 million additional deaths from extreme flattening followed by a vicious rebound. If there is social unrest the R0 will not be maintained and there won't be as many deaths directly from disease, but there could easily be that many from social unrest. If our estimate is too conservative, there could be 2 or more million additional deaths. Figure 8 shows the use of a select-day partial unlock strategy with feedback to maintain ventilator utilization, so that ventilators are not idle while a dangerous rebound builds. There are still some practical issues evident. Either the world ventilator supply has to be augmented by the middle of next month, or the entire strategy shifted to the right until the ventilator supply is augmented. However, from the US portion of the chart -and we assume Europe could if desired follow a similar pattern -by October a reservoir of immune medical volunteers and perhaps even some ventilators may become available.

The savings of life is as real as the saving in economic depression and social unrest.

Total cases are down to 63% from 70% for the US with little loss of economic activity compared to the 70% case, and the medical resources (ventilator and related) requirements have been cut in half.

It is our estimate this likely doesn't allow for much business activity. In each of these charts we have adjusted subsequent unlock levels (the stair steps in the green line) to manage total cases.
