In response to the outbreak, authorities enacted a cordon sanitaire in order to limit spread. Several studies have sought to determine the efficacy of the policy; a search of PubMed for \"coronavirus AND (travel restrictions OR travel ban OR shutdown OR cordon sanitaire) AND (Wuhan OR China)\" returned 24 results. However other studies have relied on reported cases to determine efficacy, which are likely subject to reporting and testing biases. Early outbreak dynamics are also subject to a significant degree of stochastic uncertainty due to small numbers of cases.",

Thus, the travel restrictions likely did not affect the epidemic trajectory substantially in these cities.",

Some countries have enacted cordon sanitaire-type travel restrictions, either to prevent the export of infections from an initial disease epicentre (such as Wuhan in January 2020 (2) or Northern Italy in March 2020 (3) ) to other countries and regions, or to prevent the import of infections from high-risk countries or regions (such as the USA's ban on travel from Europe (4)). Cordons sanitaires aim to curb the number of infected travellers entering a region with a high proportion of susceptible individuals, where they may seed additional chains of transmission. However, they are often reactive, occurring only after a significant number of transmission chains have been established. Hence, the efficacy of cordons sanitaires in averting or delaying outbreaks in other locations is an open question.",

Daily estimated COVID-19 prevalence in Wuhan was retrieved from outputs of a published model on the early dynamics of COVID-19 transmission in Wuhan (8) . We assumed that individuals would travel regardless of their infection status, and Wuhan was the sole source of infected individuals. We examined four travel scenarios (Table 1) , Scenario 1 is based on the observed travel pattern in 2020, and represents the Chunyun period with cordon sanitaire introduced on 23 January. Scenario 2 represents a counterfactual travel pattern used to evaluate how the COVID-19 outbreak would spread if no cordon sanitaire was implemented. This was based upon the actual travel from Wuhan for the equivalent Chunyun period in 2019. In Scenario 3, we synthesized a hypothetical travel pattern to represent a typical non-Chunyun period with cordon sanitaire introduced on 23 January, using outward travel flow on representative non-Chunyun days in 2019. Scenario 4 is a variation on Scenario 3 in which no cordon sanitaire was implemented.",

A surge in volume in the 3 days preceding the cordon sanitaire can be seen in scenario 1 (2020), where an estimated 1.69 million left Wuhan, in line with other estimates (7) . A similar outflow immediately before the LNY observed in scenario 2 (2019) suggests the surge cannot necessarily be attributed to upcoming travel restrictions.

In an unmitigated outbreak where Re remains at 2.2, incidence continues to increase exponentially. Reducing the effective reproduction number Re to simulate local control measures to reduce transmission did have a substantial effect; by 1 March, in Scenario 1 (Chunyun and cordon sanitaire) when Re was reduced by 75% to 0.55, the median daily incidence was 1 (95% CI 0 -42) infections in Beijing, 2 (95% CI 0 -31) infections in Chongqing, 0 (95% CI 0 -9) infections in Hangzhou, and 0 (95% CI 0 -11) infections in Shenzhen, which is comparable to the actual observed case counts on 1 March from the WHO Situation Report (1).",

The Baidu Huiyan mobility values were presented on a relative index scale; we assumed a linear scaling factor of 50,000 travellers per unit. This was based on widely quoted estimates of people leaving Wuhan and the inter-city capacity of the travel network (7,10-13,21,22) (Supplementary Appendix 1) . However, the index may represent a different number of travellers, or the scale may even be nonlinear and the result of a more complex function, but without other evidence we assume linearity, as have other studies (7, 12) . If we chose a higher scaling factor, similar to ones used in other studies (11, 12) , it is likely that infected travellers would have arrived even earlier and in greater numbers to the four destination cities. Additionally, by reconstructing travel outflows for both dates outside of the observed range (22 Nov -31 Dec) and simulated aspects of our scenarios, i.e. Chunyun affected travel days in non-Chunyun scenarios, the actual travel pattern may not have been accurately represented. Further assumptions were also made surrounding the pairwise travel flows, as observed data was only available for 2020, and the travel flows between Wuhan and each other prefecture-level city may have differed in 2019. We only considered Wuhan to be the sole source of infected individuals, and we only accounted for travellers making single-leg journeys to their destination. As such, we may underestimate the number of infected persons arriving by not considering the number of travellers which may have stopped in an intermediate location, become infected, and then arrived at the destination to seed local transmission, or indeed infected travellers arriving from outside of Wuhan. Hence most of our assumptions likely underestimated the number of travellers from Wuhan, and our conclusions would likely be the same even if the true number was higher. However, we also assumed that individuals would travel regardless of their infection status, which may overestimate the number of infections in destination cities.",

We find that local transmission in the four cities we studied (here defined as the probability of sustained transmission exceeding a 95% threshold) was most likely established between 2 January and 8 January; it was only on 8 January that the etiology of the \"mystery pneumonia\" (which was not yet confirmed to spread from person-to-person (25)) was determined as a novel coronavirus, and the first death occurred (26) . It is difficult to see how the cordon sanitaire could have been justified any earlier, as almost every aspect of COVID-19 virology and epidemiology was unknown. Hence, it is likely that the sustained decline in COVID-19 incidence in other cities of China several months into the outbreak is primarily due to other public health measures to reduce the disease transmissibility, i.e, to reduce the reproduction number to 1 or below (8, 18, 23) . The cordon sanitaire may have been more efficacious in delaying outbreaks internationally, as the relative number of travellers is orders of magnitude lower (7, 27) ; the same may also apply to lower-traffic destinations from Wuhan within China, such as small cities geographically distant from Wuhan, as observed in Tian et al. 2020 (7) . We found a mixed picture in these cities, where the cordon sanitaire may have been more efficacious at delaying or preventing outbreaks ( Figure S1 ). However, COVID-19 transmission dynamics may differ in comparison to big cities, and as such we chose to focus on the effect of travel restrictions in large cities with large volumes of travel from Wuhan, where data on R and k from the early outbreak in Wuhan are likely generalisable. Furthermore, these destinations with low traffic from Wuhan are more likely to be seeded by outbreaks in other, comparatively closer, large cities first. Hence, our assumption of a single outbreak source would have been much less realistic.",
