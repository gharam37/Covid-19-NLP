            "text": "The 2019 Novel Coronavirus has caused an acute shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) globally as well as shortage in the ability to test PPE such as respirator fit testing. This limits not only the ability to fit PPE to medical practitioners, but also the ability to rapidly prototype and produce alternative sources of PPE as it is difficult to validate fit. At the George Washington University, we evaluated an easily sourced method of qualitative fit testing using a nebulizer or \"atomizer\" and a sodium saccharin solution in water. If aerosolized saccharin entered candidate masks due to poor fit or inadequate filtration, then a sweet taste was detected in the mouth of the user. This method was tested against previously fit tested Milwaukee N95 and 3D Printed Reusable N95 Respirator as a positive control. A Chinese sourced KN95, cotton cloth material, and surgical mask were tested as other masks of interest. Sensitivity testing was done with no mask prior to fit test. A sweet taste was detected for both the surgical mask and cotton cloth, demonstrating a lack of seal. However, there was no sweet taste detected for the Milwaukee N95, 3D Printed Reusable N95 Respirator, or Chinese KN95. These results demonstrate this could be a valuable methodology for rapid prototyping, evaluation, and validation of fit in a non-clinical environment for use in creation of PPE. This method should be not be used without confirmation in a formal qualitative or quantitative fit test but can be used to preserve those resources until developers are confident that potential new N95 comparable respirators will pass. We strongly suggest validation of masks and respirators with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) approved fit testing prior to use in a clinical environment.",

The 2019 Novel Coronavirus has caused an unprecedented in the number of practitioners seeking N95 protection and corresponding fit testing. This has resulted in a shortage of not just N95 respirators, but also a shortage in the materials used for fit testing respirators. A survey of 8,200 nurses across the USA reported that only 55% has access to N95 respirators, and only 65% had been fit tested in the last year. ii Commercially available fit tests like those produced by 3M cost $250-350 USD, and are currently on global backorder, and can sometimes take 2 -3 months to deliver.iii It is notable that a delay of 2-3 months in these resources make the use of this supply chain impractical given that peak resource use due to COVID-19 in the United States is expected on April 15 th , 2020, which is within several weeks of the writing of this article. iv Considering these shortages, OSHA has instituted temporary guidance to switch from quantitative methods of testing N95 respirators to qualitative methods.v OSH recommends four substances for testing qualitative fit of N95 respirators vi :",

Of the four, Saccharin was determined to be low-cost, readily available, and easily detectable. For these reasons Saccharin was selected for candidacy in developing an alternative fit test. We used pellets of sodium saccharin made by NectaSweet, and purchased from a commercial vendor (Amazon, etc.). The tablets contain approximately 30 mg of sodium saccharin each, with a binder of sodium bicarbonate and cellulose. An alternative source may also include \"Sweet n Low\" packets, which contains approximately 36 mg of sodium saccharin per packet. However, we used NectaSweet tablets because it contained less binder material. NectaSweet tablets were dissolved into a warm neutral water solvent. To form this solution 60 ml water was first warmed to near boiling and then 10 pellets (each containing 30 mg of sodium saccharin) were added to the water and stirred until fully dissolved. The solution was then cooled to room temperature before use. The final solution had a concentration of 5 mg/ ml of sodium saccharin.",

The sensitivity test was detectable for all tests of all masks and all subjects, suggesting the atomizer and saccharin solution functioned comparable to a nebulizer for this purpose similar to clinically used Saccharin or Bitrix in qualitative fit tests. The N95 respirator has been approved by OSHA and US NIOSH, functioning as high efficiency particulate filter against coronavirus, and a positive control for this study. (OSHA 29CFR1910.134) The 3D Printed Reusable N95 Respirator had been previously tested in employee health, so it also served as a positive control for this purpose.",

            "text": "These results suggest similar tests could be used to rapidly prototype and fit N95 comparable respirators outside of a clinical environment due to the shortage of PPE, personnel, and access to clinical grade fit testing. It should be emphasized that after passing the protocol described in this study, clinical fit testing should still be performed and passed before N95 equivalent masks or respirators are put into use with COVID 19 positive patients. However, this study does allow for rapid testing and cycling of designs and may speed development of PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic in the setting of resource limitations. 5.0 Conclusion: Aerosols created using a nebulizer and an easily sourced saccharin solution were able to be used to test the fit of several different N95 equivalent and non-equivalent masks and respirators. This could provide a valuable non-clinical grade evaluation of N95 respirators to rapidly develop PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic. We strongly suggest validation of masks and respirators with OSHA approved fit testing prior to use in a clinical environment.",
