            "text": "We present a stochastic optimization model for allocating and sharing a critical resource in the case of a pandemic. The demand for different entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory for a central agency is to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical resource with a different state under a risk-averse condition. The model is applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID-19 pandemic by FEMA to different US states. Findings suggest that if less than 60% of the ventilator inventory is available for non-COVID-19 patients, FEMA's stockpile of 20,000 ventilators (as of 03/23/2020) would be nearly adequate to meet the projected needs in slightly above average demand scenarios. However, when more than 75% of the available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non-COVID-19 patients, various degrees of shortfall are expected. In a severe case, where the demand is concentrated in the top-most quartile of the forecast confidence interval and states are not willing to share their stockpile of ventilators, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (till 05/31/20) is about 232,000 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 17,200 ventilators on 04/19/2020. Results are also reported for a worst-case where the demand is at the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval.",

Harder hit states (such as New York, Michigan and Louisiana) are desperately trying to acquire additional ventilators in anticipation of significant shortages in the near future. Yet in the absence of a coordinated federal response, reports have emerged of states finding themselves forced to compete with each other in order to obtain ventilators from manufacturers [1] . According to New York's Governer Cuomo, the state has ordered 17,000 ventilators at the cost of $25,000/ventilator, but is expected to receive only 2,500 over the next two weeks [3] . As of 03/31/2020, according to the US presidential news briefing, more than 8,100 ventilators have been allocated by FEMA around the nation. Of these, 400 ventilators have been allocated to Michigan, 300 to New Jersey, 150 to Louisiana, 50 to Connecticut, and 450 to Illinois, in addition to the 4,400 given to New York [8] .",

The modeling framework incorporates conditions under which part of the historically available ventilator inventory is used for non-COVID-19 patients, who also present themselves for treatment along with COVID-19 patients. Thus, only a fraction of the historical ventilator inventory is available to treat COVID-19 patients. The remaining demand needs are met by allocation and re-allocation of available ventilators from FEMA and availability of additional ventilators through planned production. FEMA is assumed as the central agency that coordinates state-to-state ventilator sharing. The availability of inventory from a state for re-allocation incorporates a certain risk-aversion parameter. We present results while performing a what-if analysis under realistically generated demand scenarios using available ventilator demand data and ventilator availability data for different US states.

The problem of scarce medical resource allocation after a natural disaster using a discrete event simulation approach is investigated in [14] . Specifically, the authors in [14] investigate four resource-rationing principles: first come-first served, random, most serious first, and least serious first. It is found that without ethical constraints, the least serious first principle exhibits the highest efficiency. However, a random selection provides a relatively fairer allocation of services and a better trade-off with ethical considerations. Resource allocation in an emergency department in a multi-objective and simulation-optimization framework is studied in [16] . Simulation and queuing models for bed allocation are studied in [27, 18] .",

In the context of ventilator allocation, a conceptual framework for allocating ventilators in a public emergency is proposed in [30] . The problem of estimating mechanical ventilator demand in the United States during an influenza pandemic was considered in [22] . In a high severity pandemic scenario, a need of 35,000 to 60,500 additional ventilators to avert 178,000 to 308,000 deaths was estimated. Robust models for emergency staff deployment in the event of a flu pandemic were studied in [12] . Specifically, the authors focused on managing critical staff levels during such an event, with the goal of minimizing the impact of the pandemic. Effectiveness of the approach was demonstrated through experiments using realistic data.",

Optimal allocations prioritize local over central storage, even though the latter can be deployed adaptively, on the basis of real-time needs. Similar to this paper, the model in [19] uses an expected shortfall of ventilators in the objective function, while also considering a second criteria of total cost of ventilator stockpiling. However, the model in [19] does not consider distribution of ventilators over time. In the case of COVID-19, the ventilator demand is expected to peak at different times in different states, as the demand for each state has different trajectories.

The objective also includes a cost, parameterized by \u03b8 of allocating a ventilator by the central agency to a state at a given time. This cost can be set to zero, or set to a small value.

Therefore, we replaced these models with their expected value problem, where the stochastic demand is substituted with the expected demand. Then, we solved the resulting model. This heuristic yields an integer feasible solution to model (3) and (3) for all instances we tested in the time limit, and we report those results here. In Section 4.5.1, we provide the results on ventilator' shortage and inflow/outflow from/to FEMA for the case that there is no lead-time.

The results in Tables 1-3 suggest that when up to 60% of a state's ventilator inventory is used for non-COVID-19 patients, FEMA's current stockpile of 20,000 ventilators is nearly sufficient to meet the demand imposed by COVID-19 patients in mild cases (i.e., Cases I-III). The ventilator availability situation gets worse in the case where 75% (or greater %) of the available ventilators must be used for non-COVID-19 patients and states' risk-aversion parameter to send the idle ventilators to FEMA to be used in a different state is 3. In this case, if states are willing to share up to 50% of their excess inventory with other states, then 12,700 number of ventilators will be required beyond FEMA's current stockpile to meet demand in Cases I-IV. However, if no such sharing is considered, then the need for ventilators would increase to 14,200. This situation gets even worse for Cases V and VI, where the inventory shortfall on the worst day (04/19/2020) is between 17,200-30,600. This shortfall decreases moderately to 15,900-28,000 if states are willing to share part of their initial ventilator inventory.

The demand arising from different entities (states) peaks at different times, and it is important to meet as much of this demand as possible to save lives. Each participating state is risk averse to sharing their excess inventory at any given time, and this risk-aversion is captured by using a safety threshold parameter. Specifically, the developed model is applicable to the current COVID-19 pandemic, where many US states are in dire need of mechanical ventilators to provide life-support to severely-and critically-ill patients. Computations were performed using realistic ventilator need forecasts and availability under a wide combination of parameter settings.",

When more than 40% of the existing inventory is available for COVID-19 patients, the national stockpile is nearly sufficient to meet the demand in mild cases. However, if less than 25% of the existing inventory is available for COVID-19 patients, the current national stockpile and the anticipated production may not be sufficient under extreme demand scenarios.

This include the process of demand forecast scenario generation, estimates of initial ventilator inventory, and future production quantities. Each one of these, as well as other model parameters, can be changed in the model input to obtain more refined results.
