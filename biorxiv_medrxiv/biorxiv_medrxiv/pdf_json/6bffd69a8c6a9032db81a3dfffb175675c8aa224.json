Only 17.1% HD patients thought that COVID-19 had moderate or more severe influence on the severity of their illness, and only 13.5% PD patients did so. As for the impact on the daily life, 26.3% HD patients and 21.2% PD patients thought that COVID-19 had a moderate or more impact on their daily life, respectively. As to the reasons of going out, dialysis treatment was the main reason for HD patients, while prescribing medicine and shopping for necessities were the main reasons for PD patients ( Table 2) . What's when being asked about the most wanted supports, HD patients mainly wanted the hospitals remained open and protective equipment were adequate, which were essential for hemodialysis treatment. On the other side, PD patients hoped that the delivery of medication and PD fluid could be more convenient and the hospitals remained open as well ( Table 2) .",

On the contrary, every HD patient had to go to the dialysis center. Regular hemodialysis was very important [24] and was the main reason for going out in HD patients (93.4%). Additionally, in order to decrease the spread of COVID-19, the traffic control measures and community restrictions were adopted by the government [25] . Normal people were restricted from going out and medical proofs of dialysis treatment were required in some communities. This might cause some inconvenience for HD patients to go to dialysis centers. As we found out, 94.7% HD patients went to the hospitals at least 3 times a week.

Therefore, 44.7% HD patients worried about themselves being infected. In contrast, only 34.6% PD patients were anxious about this. Meanwhile, the shortage of masks and other protective materials was serious in February [28] . Higher frequency of going out required more protective materials. Of the patients we included, 48.7% HD patients concerned about the shortage of protective equipment, while only 28.2% PD patients worried about this. The lack of protective materials made HD patients bear greater psychological pressure. Based on all these factors, HD patients might have higher IES scores than PD patients.
