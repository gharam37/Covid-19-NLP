SARS-CoV-2 is a novel, enveloped betacoronavirus with phylogenetic similarity to SARS-CoV. 1 Unlike the coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU, that are pathogenic in humans and are associated with mild clinical symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 resembles both SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), with the potential to cause more severe disease. A critical distinction is that CoVs that infect the upper respiratory tract tend to cause a mild disease, whereas CoVs that infect both upper and lower respiratory tracts (such as SARS-CoV-2 appears to be) may cause more severe disease. Coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has since spread around the globe as a pandemic.",

We retrospectively examined the outcomes of patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who received antiviral treatment with either IFN-\u03b12b (Tianjin Sinobloway Biology, 5mIU/ml), arbidol (ARB) (arbidol hydrochloride; Jiangsu Simcere Pharm. Co.,100mg dispersible tablets), or a combination of IFN-\u03b12b plus ARB, at the discretion of the treating physician, in accordance with the current practice guidelines. 5mIU IFN-\u03b12b (1ml) were added to 2ml of sterile water and introduced as an aerosol by use of a nebulizer and mask. IFN-\u03b12b treatment was bid, i.e. 10mIU/day. ARB treatment was 200mg (2 tablets) tid, i.e. 600mg/day. Additional COVID-19 confirmed cases from Wuhan Temporary Shelter Hospital (February 2-17, 2020), who were transferred to Union Hospital and treated with only ARB, were also included in this retrospective study.

More specifically, whereas circulating levels of IL-6 remained low for all patients who received IFN, those who received ARB alone (i.e. with no IFN) exhibited a significant spike in circulating IL-6 levels ( Figure 2A , Figure 7) . We also noted elevated levels of CRP over approximately the same time that IL-6 was elevated (Supplementary Appendix, Figure   7 ).

This includes lopinavir/ritonavir, 7,8 chloroquine, 9 remdesivir ,10 as well as interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 2 and arbidol (ARB) 4 and combinations of these. Most of these antivirals only have in vitro data to support consideration for coronavirus targets prior to clinical testing; as such, while unfortunate, it is not surprising that there is a high chance of failure. 11 However, we had shown during the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in Canada that IFN-\u03b1 treatment could hasten resolution of coronavirus-mediated human disease. 3 This prompted us to evaluate IFN-\u03b1 therapy that was administered for COVID-19 disease in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Indeed, our analysis suggests that inhaled IFN-\u03b12b accelerated viral clearance from the respiratory tract and hastened resolution of systemic inflammatory processes when compared to ARB treatment alone. While we recognize that these data are at best suggestive, given the urgency, the findings indicate that a follow-up randomized placebo controlled clinical trial (RCT) is now warranted.

This form of therapy has recently been approved by China's National Health Commission 13 and is currently under consideration by the Italian Medical Agency. 14 The advantage of IFN-\u03b12b over blocking IL-6 rests in IFN targeting the cause (SARS-CoV-2), not only the symptoms (IL-6).",

Roche, Basel, Switzerland). RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 RNA were conducted using two target genes, namely open reading frame1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N). Samples were designated positive (+) or negative (-) based on a threshold adjusted to fall within the PCR exponential phase, for both target genes. 9 Complete blood count and serum biochemical tests were assessed as per the Union Hospital's routine clinical laboratory procedures. Serum cytokine levels (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3) were assayed using the BD Biosciences Th1/Th2 cytokine kit, as per the manufacturer's instructions (BD Ltd., Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and peripheral blood cell populations enumerated using a BD FACSCanto Plus flow cytometer as per the Union Hospital's routine clinical laboratory protocols.",

For 50% of all cases, treatment was started within 72hrs of confirmation of infection by a PCR(+) result; for 75% of cases, treatment started within 96hrs of a PCR(+) test and for 95% of cases, within 10 days of PCR(+). While all patients received various prophylactic antibiotic regimens as outlined in Supplementary Appendix, File 1, there was no case of proven or suspected bacterial infection. Serial clinical evaluations were performed on all patients (See Supplementary Appendix, File 1). Irrespective of the treatment group, none of the patients evaluated in this study exhibited persistent signs or symptoms of end organ dysfunction. Specifically, none of the patients developed respiratory distress requiring prolonged oxygen supplementation or intubation; consequently, none of the patients in this cohort required intensive care. Outside of the admission temperature, when approximately 50% of all patients exhibited fever (temperature > 38 o C; which was successfully treated with ibuprofen), no other occurrence of fever was noted irrespective of antiviral treatment group (Supplementary Appendix,",

With the exception of elevated platelets, which peaked two weeks into the disease course, all other cell populations fluctuated around the normal range with no clear or consistent difference discernible among antiviral treatment groups.

Specifically, outcome analysis suggested that treatment with IFN-\u03b12b, whether alone or in combination with ARB, accelerated viral clearance when compared to ARB treatment alone. Closer scrutiny of the treatment regimens for those cases treated with a combination of IFN-\u03b12b and ARB revealed that for 16 of the 46 cases (34.8%) IFN-\u03b12b treatment was started after ARB treatment had been initiated and, for 24 cases (52.2%), IFN-\u03b12b treatment was continued after ARB treatment was stopped (Supplementary Appendix, Figure 5). Given the heterogeneity of treatment regimens within this treatment group, we considered the time to viral clearance for all cases treated with IFN (i.e. combined the IFN-only with the IFN plus ARB groups) compared to those who received ARB only. The data shown in Figure 1display the statistically significant accelerated viral clearance from the upper respiratory tract in patients who received IFN-\u03b12b treatment (p=0.003). Circulating cytokine levels (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, TNF\u03b1) and biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, CRP and procalcitonin, PCT) were also examined over the disease course. Circulating levels of PCT, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 remained within their normal range throughout disease course, irrespective of treatment group (Supplementary Appendix,",
