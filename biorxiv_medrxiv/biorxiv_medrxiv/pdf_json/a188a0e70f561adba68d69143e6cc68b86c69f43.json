To combat this spread, medical imaging such as computed tomography (CT) images can be used for diagnostic. An automatic detection tools is necessary for helping screening COVID-19 pneumonia using chest CT imaging. In this work, we propose a multitask deep learning model to jointly identify COVID-19 patient and segment COVID-19 lesion from chest CT images. Our motivation is to leverage useful information contained in multiple related tasks to help improve both segmentation and classification performances. Our architecture is composed by an encoder and two decoders for reconstruction and segmentation, and a multi-layer perceptron for classification. The proposed model is evaluated and compared with other image segmentation and classification techniques using a dataset of 1044 patients including 449 patients with COVID-19, 100 normal ones, 98 with lung cancer and 397 of different kinds of pathology. The obtained results show very encouraging performance of our method with a dice coefficient higher than 0.78 for the segmentation and an area under the ROC curve higher than 93% for the classification.",

The infection can lead to severe pneumonia that can causes death. Also, COVID-19 is highly contagious, which is why it must be detected quickly, in order to isolate the infected person very fast to limit the spread of the disease.Today, the gold standard for detecting COVID-19 is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) [1] , which consists of detecting viral RNA from sputum or nasopharyngeal swab. The limitation with the RT-PCR test is due to the time needed to get the results, the availability of the material which remains very limited in hospitals [1] and its relatively low sensitivity, which does not meet the major interest of rapidly detecting positive cases as soon as possible in order to isolate them [2] . An alternative solution for rapid screening could be the use of medical imaging such as x-chest ray images or computed tomography (CT) scanners [2] .",

In [13] Ali Narin et al. created deep convolutional neural networks to automatically detect COVID-19 on X-ray images. To that end, they used transfer learning based approach with a very deep architectures such as ResNet50, InceptionV3 and Inception-ResNetV2. The algorithms were trained on the basis of 100 images (50 COVID vs 50 non-COVID) in 5 cross-validation. Authors claimed 97 % of accuracy using In-ceptionV3 and 87% using Inception-ResNetV2, however, due to the very limited size of patient and the very deep models, overfiting would rise and could not be ruled-out, hence the need to validate those results in a larger database is necessary. Also in [14] , Hemdan et al. created several deep learning models to classify x-ray images into COVID vs non-COVID classes reporting best results with an accuracy of 90% using VGG16. Again, the database was very limited with only 50 cases (25 COVID vs 25 non-COVID). A resembling study was conducted by wang and wang [15] where they trained a CNN on the ImageNET database [16] then fine-tuned on x-ray images to classify cases into one of four classes: normal, bacterial, non-COVID-19 viral and COVID-19 viral infection, with an overall performance of 83.5%. For CT images, Jinyu Zhao et al [17] created a container for CT scans initially with 275 CT COVID-19 on which they also applied a transfer learning algorithm using chest-x-ray14 [18] with 169-layer DenseNet [19] . The performance of the model is 84.7% with an area under the ROC curve of 82.4%. As of today, the database contains 347 CT images for COVID-19 patients and 397 for non-COVID patients.",

The system was deployed in 16 hospitals and performed over 1300 screenings per day. They proposed a combined model for classification and segmentation showing lesion regions in addition to the screening results. The pipeline is divided into 2 steps: segmentation and classification. They used several models including 3D U-NET++, V-NET, FCN-8S for segmentation and Incep-tionV3, ResNet50 and others for classification. They were able to achieve a dice coefficient of 0.754 using 3D U-NET ++ trained on 732 cases. The combination of 3D U-NET ++ and ResNet50 resulted in an area under the OCR curve of 0.991 with a sensitivity of 0.974 and a specificity of 0.922. In practice, the model continued to improve by re-training. The model proved to be very useful to physicians by highlighting regions of lesions which improved the diagnosis. What should be noted here is that the two models are independent and therefore they cannot help each other to improve both classification and segmentation performances.",

Three lesion labels are provided : ground glass, consolidation and plural effusion. As all legion labels are not given in all images, for the purpose of this study, we merged the three labels into one lesion label (See Fig 2) . The third dataset coming from the hospital \"Henri Becquerel Center\" in Rouen city of France includes 100 CT of normal patients and 98 of lung cancer. All the three image datasets were resized to have the same size of 256 x 256 and the intensity normalized between 0 and 1 prior to analysis.

Other powerful tool which come to hand is the use of weakly supervised learning algorithms to classify the image and detect the lesions where only a few datasets are available [29] . These weakly supervied methods can help the progress in the fight against the coronavirus COVID-19 where only few databases are usually available, and physicians are not able to provide many labeled data.",

Our method can improve the segmentation results even if we do no have many segmentation ground truths, thanks to the classification data with ground truth which can be easily obtained compared to that of segmentation. Our method shows very promising results. It outperformed the state of the art methods for image segmentation when used alone such as U-NET or image classification such as CNNs. We have shown that by combining jointly these two tasks, the method improves for both segmentation and classification performances. Moreover, adding a third task such as image reconstruction, the encoder can extract meaningful feature representation which can help the other tasks (classification and segmentation) to improve even more their performances.",

The results of 4 other experiments were also shown with multi-task learning but with a higher resolution of 512 x 512, and the combination 2 by 2 of the other tasks. The major differences between our best model and the model with higher resolution are in the sensitivity (0.94 vs 0.75) and specificity (0.79 vs 0.94). Compared to the peer combination of T1 and T3 for segmentation our model proved to be more performing with an improvement of +7% of dice, and a higher AUC and accuracy compared ti the peer T1 & T3 for classification only. The same result was observed for the peer segmentation & classification without reconstruction. Those results confirm the usefulness of the use of the reconstruction task to extract meaningful features and help improve the results of the other two tasks.
