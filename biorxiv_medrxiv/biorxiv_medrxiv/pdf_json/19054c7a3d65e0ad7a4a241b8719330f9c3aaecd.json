Automation of workflows in molecular diagnostics are instrumental for 28 coping with the large number of tests ordered by clinicians, as well as providing fast-tracked rapid 29 testing for highly urgent cases. In this study we evaluated a SARS-CoV-2 LDT for the NeuMoDx 96 30 system, a fully automated device performing extraction and real-time PCR. Methods: A publicly 31 available SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay was adapted for the automated system. Analytical performance 32 was evaluated using in-vitro transcribed RNA and clinical performance was compared to the cobas 33 6800-based reference assay within the lab. Results: The NeuMoDx-sarbeco-LDT displayed good 34 analytical performance with an LoD of 95.55 cp/ml and no false positives during evaluation of cross-35 reactivity. A total of 176 patient samples were tested with both the Sarbeco-LDT and the reference 36 assay. Positive and negative agreement were 100% and 99.2% respectively. Invalid-rate was 6.3%. 37",
