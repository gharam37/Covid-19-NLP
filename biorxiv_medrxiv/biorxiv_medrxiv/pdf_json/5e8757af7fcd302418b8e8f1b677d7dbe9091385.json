            "text": "Since its emergence in December 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly developed into a pandemic with many countries declaring emergency conditions to contain its spread. The impact of the disease, while has been relatively low in the Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) so far, is expected to be devastating given the less developed and fragmented health care system in the continent. In addition, most emergency measures such as border closings, cancellations of inbound flights, social distancing, and promotion of hand hygiene may not be as effective due to the clustered way people live in large as well as smaller population centers. As SSA waits for the start of large epidemics as seem in other regions, there exist acute need for estimates of the potential impacts of the disease once it gets strong hold in the region. To address this need, we developed a mathematical model with key parameters obtained from recent studies, to estimate the number of infections with in the first 90 days of the transmission under 54 scenarios of population sizes, initial number of cases, and coverage of contact tracing and isolation. Our results show that if implemented early, 80% contact tracing may \"flattens the curve\" of local epidemics, brings the pandemic to a manageable level for all population sizes we assessed.

            "text": "Since its emergence in December of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 virus has continued to spread in many regions with 824 thousand confirmed cases and more than 41 thousand reported deaths worldwide in 206 countries and territories by March 31, 2020 [1] . The rapid progression of the number of infections and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 has taken many by surprise, with many of its characteristics related to its transmissibility under continuous update [2] . While the disease is still actively spreading in many regions of the world, researchers are working to quantify transmission parameters [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , and make estimates of infections and resulting deaths under different scenarios [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, these studies are either too specific to certain geographies [10, 12] or are too general to handle realistic scenarios [8, 11] in the context of Sub Saharan Africa where majority of the population live in rural and semi urban areas with poor physical interconnections. To overcome this problem and make estimates of infections in clusters of population with different sizes, we developed a mathematical based model with Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed states, with parameters obtained from recent studies, and based on 54 scenarios of initial number of cases, coverage of contact tracing, and population size, more suited to realities in resource poor, less inter-connected regions around the world.",

Once exposed, infected individuals stay in that state for the duration of the incubation period (1/\u03be) and subsequently progress to the infectious state I, where they stay for the length of the infectious period (1/\u03b3) until they are removed either through isolation or recovery. In our model, contact tracing coverage of \u03b8 is assumed to affect those that are in the infectious state where those affected will be transitioned to the removed state R. We assumed a mean time to isolation after start of the infectious period (1/\u03d5, where 0 < 1/\u03d5 < 1/\u03b3).

We run all scenarios based on the cluster sizes: 100 thousand, 1 million and 3 million populations in consideration of population clusters most common in the SSA context, yielding in a total of 54 scenarios. All model simulations were performed using the Partially Observed Markov Process (Pomp) package available in R, with all scenarios run based on Monte Carlo sample of parameter values from their corresponding distributions.",
