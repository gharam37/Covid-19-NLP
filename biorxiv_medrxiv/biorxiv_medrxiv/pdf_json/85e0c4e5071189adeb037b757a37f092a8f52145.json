The time-delay adjusted case fatality risk of COVID-19 in Korea is yet to be 27 estimated. 28 29 Methods: We obtained the daily series of confirmed cases and deaths in Korea reported prior to March 21, 30 2020. Using statistical methods, we estimated the time-delay adjusted risk for death from COVID-19 in the 31 city of Daegu, Gyeongsangbuk-do, other regions in Korea, as well as for the entire country. 32 33 Results: Our model-based crude CFR fitted the observed data well throughout the course of the epidemic 34 except for the very early stage in Gyeongsangbuk-do, partially due to the reporting delay. Our estimates of 35 the risk for death in Gyeongsangbuk-do reached 2.4% (95% CrI: 1.6-3.4%), 1.3% (95% CrI: 1.0-1.6%) in 36 Daegu and 0.7% (95% CrI: 0.3-1.4%) in other regions, whereas the national estimate of the risk for death 37 was estimated at 1.4% (95% CrI: 1.2-1.7%) in Korea. 38 39 Conclusions: The relatively low CFRs are associated with the early implementation of public health 40 interventions including widespread testing, social distancing, and delayed school openings in Korea. 41 Geographic differences in CFR are likely influenced by clusters of nosocomial transmission. 42 43",

Specifically, we have estimated time-delay adjusted CFR in three different 154 geographic areas in Korea and found that the most severely affected areas were Gyeongsangbuk-do while 155 the rest of Korea exhibits milder severity impact. Specifically, the delay-adjusted CFR in Gyeongsangbuk-156 do, largely driven by hospital-based transmission, was relatively high, being estimated at 2.4% (95% CrI: 157 1.6-3.4%), which is about 2-fold higher than our estimate for Daegu and for all regions in Korea. These 158 findings suggest that the situation in Gyeongsangbuk-do is more severe compared with the other affected 159 areas in Korea. 160",

It was also reported that the risk of symptomatic 162 infection also increases with age, although this may be partially affected by preferential ascertainment of 163 In addition, our estimates on CFR are relatively lower than the CFR obtained from affected areas in China 174 (ranging from 1.41%-5.25%), based on the cases and deaths observed to date [18, 29] . In general, the CFR 175 of the same disease might vary greatly in different countries or even different regions of the same country, 176 partially due to differences in health control policies, availability of healthcare, medical standards, and 177 detection efficiency. In Korea, an extensive COVID-19 testing regime has been instituted, and authorities 178 launched a massive contact tracing as case numbers grew. As a result, the country has tested more people In conclusion, our estimates of the risk for death from COVID-19 in Korea as of March 21, 2020, 221 were as high as 2.4% in Gyeongsangbuk-do and as low as 0.7% in the less severely affected areas in Korea, 222 and this difference in CFR is likely influenced by nosocomial transmission of the disease. In the absence 223 of pharmaceutical interventions (i.e., vaccination and antiviral drugs), the control of COVID-19 is highly 224 dependent on public health interventions including social distancing measures, isolation of the infected, 225 delayed school openings, and extensive testing of potential contacts of confirmed cases. The estimates of 226 CFR associated with COVID-19 is thus critical to help inform the assessments of health impacts and to 227 determine both the intensity and appropriateness of mitigation strategies as the epidemic unfolds. 228 ",

Among the cumulative cases with reported day t in 109 area a, Da,ti have died and the remainder have survived the infection.

Posterior distributions of the model parameters were estimated by sampling from the 115 three Markov chains. For each chain, we drew 100,000 samples from the posterior distribution after a burn-116 in of 20,000 iterations. Convergence of MCMC chains were evaluated using the potential scale reduction 117 statistic [21, 22].

During the course of the outbreak, our model-based posterior estimates of time-138 delay adjusted CFR take much higher values than the observed crude CFR. Our estimates of the time-delay 139 adjusted CFR appear to be decreasing almost consistently in all of the three areas, whereas in 140Gyeongsangbuk-do, estimates were low at the early stage and then increased and peaked in the midst of the 141 study period, and are now following a decreasing trend similar to the other two areas, reaching estimates 142 around 2.5%. 143The latest estimates (March 21, 2020) of the time-delay adjusted CFR are at 1.3% (95% CrI: 1.0-144 1.6%) in Daegu, 2.4% (95% CrI: 1.6-3.4%) in Gyeongsangbuk-do, 0.7% (95% CrI: 0.3-1.4%) in Other 145 regions and 1.4% (95% CrI: 1.2-1.7%) in Korea, while the observed crude CFR is 1.2% (95% CI: 0.9-1.4%)",

Such 180 extensive testing might have effectively identified COVID-19 cases even with mild symptoms, thus 181 lowering the CFR. 182The reported CFR of COVID-19 tends to vary over the course of epidemic curve. It is noteworthy 183 that the upward trend of CFR during the early phase generally indicates increasing ascertainment bias.184 During a growing epidemic the final clinical outcomes of most reported cases are unknown, and thus 185 underestimating the true CFR early in the epidemic. Such effect was observed in our results (Fig. 2) as well 186 as in prior studies of past epidemics of respiratory pathogens including SARS and H1N1 influenza [30, 31]. 187 Similarly, the observed time lag between onset of symptoms and outcomes tends to bias the estimated CFR 188 downwards during the early growth phase of an epidemic. 189 When the transmission of COVID-19 was widely recognized by clusters of confirmed cases such 190 as hospital-based transmission, surveillance is typically biased towards detecting clinically severe cases, 191 therefore resulting in higher CFR estimates. Specifically, hospital-based transmission has occurred during 192 the outbreak of COVID-19 in Korea, including clusters based in Cheongdo Daenam Hospital (resulting in 193 120 infections), Hansarang Convalescent Hospital (75 infections) and Gyeongsan Seo Convalescent 194 Hospital (30 infections) in Gyeongsangbuk-do, which explains our higher CFR estimate at 2.4% (95% CrI: 195 1.6-3.4%) for Gyeongsangbuk-do. Similarly, nosocomial clusters also occurred in Bundang Je-saeng 196 Hospital (38 infections) in Gyeonggi province, KimSin Recuperation Hospital (26 infections) in Daegu, 197 and Eunpyeong St Mary's Hospital (14 infections) in Seoul [5]. Such hospital-based transmission resulted 198 in secondary infections affecting healthcare workers, inpatients and their visitors, which tend to elevate 199 CFR estimates as has been previously documented for outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome 200 (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome in the past [32, 33]. In addition, a large number of COVID-201 19 cases are related to church clusters in Korea, including a total of 5,037 COVID-19 cases in a cluster 202 linked to the Shincheonji Church, accounting for about 57% of all confirmed cases [5]. 203 Asymptomatic patients complicate the estimation of CFR for COVID-19. In fact, the transmission 204 of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic individuals (or individuals within the incubation period) has also been 205 described [34-36]. For instance, in a COVID-19 outbreak on a cruise ship, about half of the 619 confirmed 206 COVID-19 cases were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis [37]. Moreover, some of patients with 207 asymptomatic infection showed objective clinical abnormalities. In a previous study of 24 patients with 208 asymptomatic infection and their chest computed tomography (CT), 50 percent of those had typical ground-209 glass opacities or patchy shadowing, and another 20 percent had atypical imaging abnormalities [38]. In 210 addition, it is likely that asymptomatic or very mild cases were not reported, and thus were not included in 211 our analysis, possibly overestimating our CFR. Future research and more accurate incidence data including 212 age-stratified serologic studies would improve our estimates. 213 During the course of the epidemic, estimates of the time-adjusted CFR for Daegu, Gyeongsangbuk-214 do, other regions (outside Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk-do) as well as all regions in Korea showed a declining 215 trend. A downward trend in time-adjusted CFR after its peak suggests the extent of improvement in 216 epidemiologic surveillance. In addition, a downward trend in CFR is partially due to a substantial number 217 of mild or asymptomatic cases, which might prolong the end of the outbreak [18]. We note that a similar 218 trend was previously reported for the COVID-19 outbreak in China, and for the 2015 MERS outbreak in 219 South Korea.",
