Data pertaining to Covid-2019 cases were extracted from Worldometer. Ozone concentration levels were taken from the open-access database of World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC). Latitude of specific area where measurement took place was also provided in the database. Preliminary Kendall rank correlation test revealed that Covid-2019 incidence was positively and significantly related to ozone concentration; however, incidence was not significantly related to latitude. Using multivariate linear regression, a statistically significant link between ozone concentration and Covid-2019 incidence in 34 countries was established; however, I found no statistical association between latitude and Covid-2019 incidence refuting previous claims. Prompt health actions should be developed for areas with high ozone concentration in the present and possibly, future outbreaks; however, extensive laboratory analysis should be conducted to further confirm the findings of the study. Nevertheless, the results of this study could serve as a basis for further clinical and large-scale studies.",

Previous works also provided argument pertaining to the possible relationship between latitude dependence of Covid-2019 mortality and Vitamin D deficiency. 4, 5 Vitamin D is strongly affected by ozone variability, since ozone filters Ultraviolet B, an important factor for Vitamin D synthesis. 6 A possible link between ozone concentration and Covid-2019 incidence, therefore, should be established.

The sample size is small; hence, generalizability of the results is limited to the countries included in the analysis. Also, actual patients' information were not used to support the claim on the relationship between Vitamin D supplementation and Covid-2019 clinical outcome. Therefore, clinical trials and large sample studies should be conducted to further verify the causal link among these variables.",

Although no clinical trials have been made in the 34 countries included in the study, Vitamin D levels in individuals residing in areas where ozone concentration was high could possibly be deficient or at least insufficient. Studies established how Vitamin D supplementation could increase immunity against infection, especially the common cold. 9,10 While there is a dearth of research confirming the effect of Vitamin D supplementation on Covid-2019 outcome among actual patients, a previous work found Vitamin D supplementation could possibly improve clinical outcomes of Covid-2019 patients based on increasing odds ratio of having a mild outcome when serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level increases. 5 Serum 25(OH)D is a robust indicator of Vitamin D status. Hence, health action plans could be developed to provide adequate intake of Vitamin D to individuals living in areas where ozone concentration is high. However, the negative spillover effects of low ozone concentration should not be downplayed as this is an important indicator of ozone layer depletion in the stratosphere.",
