Although we cannot use the rise in numbers seropositive to infer the contemporary seroprevalence or the growth rate of the epidemic, we note that they are consistent with frequency of reported diagnosed infections and SARS-CoV-2-associated 60 deaths reported in that time period in Scotland, given that seroconversion takes up to [2] [3] weeks. It should also be noted that blood donors are not representative of the general population; in particular, those with a history of recent respiratory infections are deferred. [1] [2] [3] [4] . Since the first reports in December, 2019, infections with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported from an increasing number of countries worldwide, with particularly high incidence of diagnosed infections and associated deaths from respiratory disease initially in China but more recently in Italy, Iran, Spain, France and the USA (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). Increasing age, male 80 gender, smoking and comorbidities such as cardiac disease, hypertension and diabetes have been identified as risk factors for severe infections [5] [6] [7] . For as yet unknown reasons, infants and children seem to be less at risk for moderate to severe COVID-19 disease 8 .",

However, a dramatic rise in the number of admissions of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infections followed and emergency plans have been implemented. Prediction of the future severity of the outbreak, and most specifically the trajectory of severe cases that require hospitalisation and intensive care support is key to the national response, as it is throughout several affected countries worldwide. Predicting disease 90 outcomes is complex; in addition to the basic information of the proportions of individuals in different age ranges who develop severe disease, the severity of the outbreak is also crucially dependent on current population immunity and virus transmissibility. Mean estimates of R0 of 3.29 (2.12 -4.45 interquartile range from 12 studies based on presumed SARS-CoV-2 naive populations) 9 indicate that a 50%-75% minimum level of herd immunity from past 95 infection is sufficient for a sustained reduction of new infections with time. SARS-CoV-2 spread may be further influenced by seasonal changes in transmissibility, as observed for other respiratory coronaviruses infecting humans [10] [11] [12] .",

The results presented in the study are therefore based on a formally non-validated assay. However, we believe that 280 the neutralisation antibody test is likely to be robust. Firstly, it is based on the same design as pMN assays for SARS-CoV-1, ebolavirus and influenza A virus; pMN assays that have demonstrated high specificity for target virus neutralising antibodies and a sensitivity that is often greater than achieved in neutralising antibody assays for whole virus [13] [14] [15] . Overall, although sampling was limited, there was concordance between the pMN assay to detect 285 neutralising antibody and the detection of anti-spike IgG antibody by ELISA . The pMN assay does, however, require comparison with neutralisation of live virus for further interpretation of these data.",

Some previous studies have indicated an absence of reactivity of negative control sera against the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein in ELISA and the high specificity of assays based on the spike protein compared to those using the more conserved nucleoprotein or whole virus 18 . SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is likely to share this 295 specificity. Existing data on neutralising antibodies indicates that assay specificity may be even greater; although both SARS-CoV-1 and -2 enter cells through the ACE-2 receptor [19] [20] [21] , and possess structurally similar spike proteins 20,22-24 , it has recently been demonstrated that neutralising monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against SARS-CoV-1 infection bound but did not neutralise SARS-CoV-2 25 , Conversely, MAbs raised against SAR-CoV-2 showed little or no 300 cross-neutralisation of SARS-CoV-1 26,27 . However, cross-reactivity is most unlikely to cause an assay specificity problem, as SARS-CoV-1 has never spread significantly in the UK or elsewhere in Europe 28 .",

All other samples from 2020 showed low IC50 values, low R 2 values or in most cases low values for both and were classified as negative. To verify the antibody results, the positive samples and a selection of negatives, including those close to the threshold of positivity in the pMN assay, were tested in an anti-spike 215 protein ELISA for IgG and IgM antibodies at a single 1:50 dilution. ELISA analysis identified a further antibody positive test sample that was not clearly positive in the pMN assay ( : 2.55 R 2 :0.32; lower left quadrant in Fig. 2). Optical densities (ODs) recorded for the positive controls and blood donor samples that were positive in the pMN assay showed a good correlation with neutralising antibody titres in the ELISA for IgG antibodies (Fig. 3). 220 The two weak positive samples in the pMN assay were also clearly reactive in the ELISA and have been assigned as positive in this study.

However, they might be 260considered a reasonable representation of the adult population for SARS-CoV-2 (and other respiratory viruses) in the absence of any obvious predisposing factors for infection. The only other general exclusion was a 4 week donation deferral period in those recently travelled to specified countries at risk for arbovirus and malaria infections (including China). However, since the onset of the outbreak, donors have also been deferred if they have a history of a 265 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, or respiratory symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection within the previous 28 or 14 days (listed in Suppl. Data). The potential exclusion of infected symptomatic donors will therefore systematically reduce the seroprevalence recorded and skew the estimate of population seroconversion.

An investigation of immune responses in patients in the related MERS-CoV indicate that antibody seroconversion in coronavirus infections may not occur in all individuals 29 . Of concern, those with mild MERS-CoV infections (asymptomatic, or 315 symptoms restricted to fever, headache, cough, and malaise) invariably failed to seroconvert for IgM or IgG antibody in immunoassays and similarly failed to mount a neutralising antibody throughout the study period. These observations contrast with universal seroconversion in those with moderate or severe MERS. If SARS-CoV-2 showed a similar disease-related differences in serological responses, it is possible that a substantial proportion 320 of the test population in the current study may have been infected but negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies. Studies on SARS-CoV-1 showed that most patients seroconverted after infection but this was delayed (17-21 days) compared to a typical time course for seroconversion with other 325 respiratory viruses 30,31 . Several studies demonstrate seroconversion of IgG antibodies against the spike protein 1-3 weeks after infection with SARS-CoV-2 32-36 . A robust early and strong IgM, IgG and neutralising antibody responses was similarly observed in hospitalized individuals identified on contact tracing -in 50% of subjects by day 7, and in all nine by day 14 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2196-x). A proteome analysis of antibody induced by 330 SARS-CoV-2 in 29 donors revealed a reproducibly detectable response to Spike and N proteins following SARS-CoV-2 infection 37 . However, there remains considerable uncertainty in this area. For example, a study of 175 hospitalized patients in China indicated a wide range of neutralizing antibody levels detectable post-recovery, with a some below the level of detection, especially amongst younger patients (9/55 assayed in those <40 years 335 old) 38 . Similarly, the median time for seroconversion to IgG in hospitalized patients was found to be 14 days in a study of 173 patients in China, with some taking up to 1 month to",

Extrapolating this figure to represent the past infection frequency of SARS-CoV-2 in this and the wider community has a number of uncertainties that need to resolved in future studies in this and other similar populations. However, this study implements a novel method of tracking the spread of epidemics like the current SARS-CoV-2 350 outbreak, and should be carefully considered as a routine component of an immediate response to such an impending threat. 355 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to acknowledge the help and collaboration of many SNBTS staff for provision and preparation of samples (anonymous archive and recent donation samples).
