In the early phase of the epidemic, almost all patients worked at or lived around the Huanan Seafood Whole Market in Wuhan [10] . With COVID-19 spread rapidly in Hubei province, Wuhan-related exposures was regarded as a key criterion. Previous retrospective research demonstrated that 86% cases had a Wuhan-related exposures history [11] . Similarly, our study revealed most of infected patients lived around Xiling strict, because of many residents working at China Gezhouba Group Corporation, returning from Wuhan. The common symptoms of COVID-19 patients were fever, fatigue and cough, some patients may present with abdominal symptoms [12] . While a few patients without any symptoms were detected accidentally by chest CT [11] .Thus, it is difficult to suspect the disease without auxiliary examinations. The significant of laboratory examinations was blood routine, the results suggested leukocytes were mainly normal or decreased, and lymphocytes reduced evidently in many COVID-19 patients [13] . A recent research indicated that lymphocytes,especially CD3 + lymphocytes and CD45 + lymphocytes, decreased significantly in comparison with non-COVID patients, while there was no significantly difference in quantities and proportions of neutrophils and monocytes [14] .Results of this analysis showed lymphocytes and eostinophils decreased obviously without leukocytes increasing in most patients, and neutrophils,monocytes and platelet mainly kept at normal range,it was consistent with previous reports. In term of chest CT, the typical image features were peripheral, subpleural ground glass opacities in the lower lobes. However, a study of CT manifestations demonstrated that it was approximately 14% COVID-19 patients with atypical CT features [15] . Real time RT-PCR was considered a standard assessment for COVID-19\uff0cbut the sensitivity was lower than chest CT scans, RT-PCR was 71%, chest CT scans reached 98% [16] .Thus, it was essential to perform chest CT for detecting the suspected patients.",

Oxygen inhalation was important to avoid to ARDS for the COVID-19 patients with hypoxemia. In this study, 76.6% patients received oxygen by nasal catheter, and 90% received antiviral therapy, and 38.1% received glucocorticoids. CDC reported that the case-fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 the overall case--fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 was 2.3% in confirmed cases, and CFR among critical cases may reach 49.0% [11] . Nevertheless, most of patients were still treated in the hospital. Another retrospective study suggest the CFR was about 11% [13] . Statistical analysis of this study found that the CFR was 14.2%, and most of them were over 70 year-old patients accompanying with chronic illness. In the past one month, numerous effective measures, including blocking cities and roads, closing supermarket, monitoring temperature, building a new hospital and setting up medical assistance team, have been carried out to controlling infection source, preventing transmission and reducing death. Until now, there was no new confirmed patients for 13 days,and hospitalized patients decreased sharply.",
