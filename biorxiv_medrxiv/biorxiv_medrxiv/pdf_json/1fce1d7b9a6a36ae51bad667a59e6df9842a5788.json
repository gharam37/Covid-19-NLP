            "text": "In this article, we introduce an unsupervised algorithm to identify putative virus host ranges based on only genome sequence information (figure 1). The proposed methodology has been tested in 94 viruses of genus Flavivirus and 16 potential hosts. Several flaviviruses are major human pathogens, with potential host ranges from vertebrates to arthropods 9 . Flaviviruses are classified by vector type into mosquito-borne (MBFV), tick-borne (TBFV), insect-only (IOFV) and unknown vector (UVFV) 10 flaviviruses. In MBFVs, there exists a paraphyletic subgroup of mosquito-specific viruses 11 , also known as dual-host insect-only flaviviruses (dhIOFVs). Flaviviruses with the same host type tend to be monophyletic and are subject to the same selective pressures as the host; this situation is reflected in their codon usage and dinucleotide composition 12 . The most widespread and prevalent flaviviruses include Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and Zika virus (ZKV) 13 . Several articles suggest that highly similar codon usage frequencies between viruses and hosts are indicative of a high virus-host adaptation level 14 . Thus, the codon adaptation index (CAI) 15 may be a robust indicator to determine putative hosts. Here, we use a normalized CAI (nCAI) to compare codon usage frequencies across virus and host sequences (see methods section). The highest level of optimization is at nCAI=1.0, when the relative use of synonymous codons in the virus and host is identical. Virus-host adaptations are also evaluated with a correspondence analysis (CA) plot (figure 2). Flaviviruses able to infect a wide range of hosts (generalists) tend to be in the center of the plot, whereas host-specific flaviviruses move away from the center towards their optimal hosts (supplementary figures 1-2). Therefore, the nCAI-CA algorithm provides a fast and reliable method of identifying the putative host range of a virus. This method requires only coding sequences (CDSs) without prior knowledge and can be implemented with minimal computational equipment. In addition, we have developed an easy-to-use web server, available at http://ppuigbo.me/programs/CAIcal/nCAI , to calculate nCAI values.",

Each viral subgroup formed a distinct cluster based on relative synonymous codon usage (supplementary figures 3-4) and GC content (%GC) (supplementary figures 5-7). In addition, we determined the interspecies and intraspecies variability of the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) and %GC in the DENV, JEV, WNV and ZKV genomes. The results showed that the RSCU values could differentiate viral subgroups within species and that their distances mostly reflected the evolutionary histories of the viruses (supplementary figure 5 ). The %GC was not a discriminating factor at the intraspecific level (supplementary figure 6) . At the interspecies level, the clustering patterns based on the RSCU were only slightly more similar to the evolutionary histories of the viruses than the %GC (supplementary figure 7) .",

The nCAI-CA algorithm was able to accurately determine host types for MBFVs and UVFVs (vertebrates), IOFVs ( Aedes mosquitoes), and TBFVs ( Ixodes scapularis ) (figure 2). The paraphyletic group of dhIOFVs clustered between Aedes mosquitoes and vertebrates (supplementary figure 1 ). The CA plot shows a partial overlap between the MBFV and TBFV groups (supplementary figure 1) ; however, on average, TBFVs had higher nCAI values (0.813) than MBFVs (0.765) for I. scapularis , suggesting a higher degree of optimization for tick hosts (supplementary table 2 ). The nCAI-CA analysis also revealed unexpected findings for individual viruses, e.g., WNVs clustered within MBFVs but near TBFVs, which aligns with the results of previous infectivity tests 18 and some observational studies (supplementary table 1). All the viruses could be classified into two general host groups: vertebrates (MBFVs, TBFVs, UVFVs and dhIOFVs) and mosquitoes (IOFVs) (supplementary figure 2). As expected, no group clustered near Anopheles gambiae or Culex quinquefasciatus , suggesting that these are not optimal hosts for flaviviruses.",

Likely optimal hosts (within an nCAI range of 0.9-1.1) include mammals ( Myotis brandtii , M. davidii , Mus musculus , Bos taurus and Homo sapiens ) and Aedes mosquitoes ( Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus ). Unlikely hosts due to low adaptation (nCAI < 0.9) include C. quinquefasciatus , A. gambiae , I. scapularis and Sus scrofa . These results are in accordance with previous studies and observations, e.g., most MBFVs have a reproductive cycle that includes Aedes (host-vector) or Culex (vector) mosquitoes and a primary mammalian host (supplementary table 1 ). Based on these analyses, flaviviruses are potentially less adapted to reproduction in Culex mosquitoes due to the differences in %GC between Culex and Aedes mosquitoes . Moreover, our analysis suggests that TBFV is a group of flaviviruses optimized to reproduce in vertebrates and use ticks as vectors (and we speculate that they may occasionally reproduce in ticks). In general, flavivirus codon usage is overoptimized (nCAI > 1.1) for birds ( Columba livia , Gallus gallus , Anas platyrhynchos ), amphibians ( Xenopus laevis ) and reptiles ( Alligator mississippiensis ).",

The algorithm is based on the assumption that there is a selection pressure to optimize the relative use of synonymous codons in the virus. However, it is well known that some viruses use the opposite strategy, and some viruses deoptimize codon usage to hide from host defense mechanisms 19 . In addition, viruses with overoptimized codon usage (nCAI >> 1) might be explained by multiple factors, e.g., adaptation to multiple hosts, effects of extreme %GC bias or adaptation to highly expressed genes 20 . Nevertheless, further empirical investigations are necessary to determine reliable confidence intervals for nCAI. Host determination may be uncertain if viruses display approximately equal optimizations for different host types; for example, although dhIOFV codon usage is optimized for both vertebrate and mosquito hosts, they are insect-specific 11 . Although common host preference patterns are observed, the optimal hosts vary depending on the virus or subgroup and may not reflect documented cases (supplementary table 1 ). The observed host ranges also do not distinguish between vectors and hosts, and classical phylogenomic methods cannot determine potential hosts without confirmed cases. Our nCAI-based method overcomes this limitation by directly measuring the adaptation of viruses to the translational machinery of their hosts.",

In the first phase, the algorithm computes the required codon usage tables through two subroutines: one for the host and the other for the virus. These tables along with complete genomic CDSs are then used as the input data for CAIcal 21 . This produces CAI data between the virus and host (CAI h ) using virus CDSs and host codon usage tables and CAI data for the virus itself (CAI s ) using virus CDSs and virus codon usage tables. In the second phase, the CAI h values are normalized by dividing each by its respective CAI s as follows:",

The CAI values for possible hosts and viruses of interest are computed from the complete coding sequences (CDSs) and the codon usage tables, which are calculated from the same sequences. The CAI values of the host (CAI h ) are calculated from virus CDSs and host codon usages, and the CAI values of the viruses (CAI s ) are computed using virus CDSs and the codon usage values of the viruses themselves. The resulting CAI values are then normalized by dividing each CAI h by its respective CAI s .",
