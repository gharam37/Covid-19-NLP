Methods: A Polynomial Regression Model with cubic adjustments of the number of days of contagion, demographic density, city population and climatic factors was designed and used to explain the spread of COVID-19 in Brazil. Main results: It was evidenced that temperature variation maintains a relationship with the reduction in the number of cases of COVID-19. A variation -3.4% in the number of COVID-19 cases was found for each increase of 1 \u00b0 C. Conclusion: There are evidences that the temperature, has a relative effect in the variation in the number of COVID-19's researched cases. For the reason, it recommends this relationship deserves to be investigated in other tests with more extended time series, wide and with especially non-linear data adjustments.",

The authors also pointed out that a variant similar to SARS-CoV-2, the influenza virus, was affected by the climate. Today it is unknown whether COVID-19 follows the same scalability (LOWEN\u00b2; BARRECA & SHIMSHACK\u00b3). Bukhari and Jameel\u00b9 found some important findings in their data, for example, they made an analysis of the climatic patterns of the regions affected by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide until March 22, 2020, with 83% of the tests being performed in non-tropical countries (30N and above) and 90% of SARS-CoV-2 cases were recorded in the same countries within a temperature range of 3 \u00b0C to 17 \u00b0 C.",

It was found that in the single-factor model of the highest temperature group, each 1\u00baC increase in the minimum temperature led to a 0.86% reduction in the cumulative number of cases. Thus, the study concluded that, to some extent, the temperature could impact COVID-19 transmission and there may be a better temperature for viral transmission, which may partly explain why the first explosion occurred in Wuhan. It is suggested that countries and regions with the lowest temperature in the world adopt the most stringent control measures to avoid future reversals (WANG ET AL. ).",

It means that above 80% of the variations of the dependent variable (Y) are derived from variations of independents variables (X1 ...Xn). It is a relatively robust statistical model, with algebraic signs according to the established hypotheses, and, therefore, liable to have its results deepened. The statistical model plotted on the temporal dynamics of COVID-19 in Brazil, demonstrated a robust dimension of the population and demographic density. The issue of temperature the municipalities also demonstrated that there are strong indications that this variable is also significant, but in smaller dimension. It was evidenced that the temperature variation maintains a relationship with the reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases. However, this depends on the contagion process in progress. The expected reductions in the number of cases of COVID-19 with the temperature increase in 1\u00ba C is -3.4%. (Graph 4) .",
