Insufficient access to testing has hampered effective public health interventions and patient care management in a number of countries. Furthermore, the availability of regulatory-cleared reagents has challenged widespread implementation of testing. We rapidly developed a qRT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 detection assay using a 384-well format and tested its analytic performance across multiple nucleic acid extraction kits. Our data shows robust analytic accuracy on residual clinical biospecimens. Limit of detection sensitivity and specificity was confirmed with currently available commercial reagents. Our methods and results provide valuable information for other high-complexity laboratories seeking to develop effective, local, laboratory-developed procedures with high-throughput capability to detect SARS-CoV-2.",

For the majority of qRT-PCR procedures, RNA must be extracted from patient samples [1, 3] . SARS-CoV-2 present in patient samples must be inactivated during the lysis step of RNA extraction for the safety of individuals working with the samples. The CDC has confirmed the use of several RNA extraction kits with external lysis buffer that is effective at inactivating SARS-CoV-2 [5] . Unfortunately, access to these kits is severely limited, hampering widespread implementation of testing. Validation of new RNA extraction kits and qRT-PCR reagents is desperately needed to ease supply constraints and to increase testing worldwide. Two of the CDC approved kits, the QIAmp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen) and EasyMag NucliSENS kit (biom\u00e9rieux), have lysis buffers that contain guanidinium thiocyanate and guanidine thiocyanate, respectively. A third kit, the NucleoSpin Virus RNA/DNA extraction kit (Machery Nagel, Takara) which is not currently CDC approved, contains guanidine hydrochloride in the lysis buffer. We compared these three extraction methods and performed qRT-PCR with RUO primer-probe sets targeting the CDC approved 2019-nCoV_N1, 2019-nCoV_N2 and human RNase P (RP) sequences. Responding to current shortages in reagent availability, we developed a 384-well, lower volume qRT-PCR assay with an alternative single step master mix. Our data demonstrate all three RNA extraction kits can be used with this laboratory-developed procedure to effectively detect SARS-CoV-2 and that reducing input and qRT-PCR reaction volumes can still provide sensitivity of detection down to 5 copies of viral genome per microliter (comparable to previously validated methods).",

All work with patient samples is performed in a biological safety cabinet (BSC), including centrifugation, vortexing and heating. Additional BSL2+ precautions include: changing outer gloves after any manipulation of samples prior to removing hands from the BSC, reduced pipette speed to minimize aerosol risks, working over towels soaked in 10% bleach, and disposing pipet tips used with clinical samples into a container with bleach. For viral inactivation, clinical samples are first placed in tubes containing viral lysis buffer and treated according to manufacturer's protocol. Samples are transferred into a new clean tube containing 96-100% ethanol as per the next step in the RNA extraction protocol. After inactivation, sample tubes are surface decontaminated, placed in secondary containment, and moved into a separate room where the remainder of the RNA extraction protocol is carried out at standard BSL2 practices in a BSC.

A minimum of two no template controls (NTCs) were included on all runs. Baselines were allowed to calculate automatically, and a \u0394Rn threshold of 0.5 was selected and set uniformly for all runs.

We utilized a subset of available clinical biospecimens, synthetic positive extraction controls, and nucleic acid controls to test initial parameters, confirm reproducibility, and determine a initial limit of detection. One aliquot each of four clinical samples (two positive, two negative) and three separate aliquots of a synthetic positive control with 200 viral copies per microliter (EDx_200) were extracted with Qiagen viral RNA reagents (one of the CDC-approved extraction methods); all unique extractions were run in PCR replicate (n=8 clinical replicates, 6 synthetic replicates). All samples showed expected positive (viral N1 and N2 gene targets detected with internal human RP gene control detected) or negative (N1, N2 undetermined, RP detected) results across all replicates. The average Ct values demonstrated a narrow standard deviation across both extraction and PCR replicates (Table 1 ). Further, we tested five-fold dilutions of input RNA into nuclease free water for all of these samples. Each dilution remained positive for SARS-CoV-2; and demonstrated delta Ct values ranging between 2.01-3.16 for the viral N1 and N2 targets ( Table 2 ). The internal human control RP gene target showed the greatest amount of delta Ct variability in this test.",
