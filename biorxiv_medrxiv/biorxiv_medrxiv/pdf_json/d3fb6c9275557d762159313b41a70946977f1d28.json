For this reason, we and others have sought to demonstrate the potential for decontamination and reuse of existing N95 respirators. Standardized procedures already exist for the sterilization and reuse of medical equipment and surfaces, such as autoclaving, steam heat, and chemical inactivation (e.g. bleach) (1) . Sterilization of most medical equipment is verified using spore-based biological indicators. Unlike most hospital equipment (e.g. steel, metal, plastic) or fabrics (e.g. blankets) for which standardized sterilization methods exist (1), N95 respirators were not intended for re-use (2) . Thus many of the standard sterilization approaches deform, damage, or destroy the integrity of N95 respirator fabric, nosepieces, or elastic straps (3, 4) . Aerosolized or vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) offers promising methods of use for decontamination for N95 respirators, with indications that these methods are non-deforming, non-damaging, and can penetrate the densely-woven fabric of respirator facepieces (3, 5) . In addition, the virucidal capability of H2O2 sterilization methods have been previously demonstrated (6) (7) (8) .",

This study included multiple respirator facepiece types, representing those in wide use by local healthcare and research personnel. Successful decontamination of microbes was tested using stable, resistant spore-based bio-indicators (Geobacillus stearothermophilus), as well as by using multiple viral surrogates which represent the structure, characteristics, and environmental resistance of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. Virologic testing utilized sensitive plaque assays to detect the partial inactivation of viruses by drying onto respirator surfaces, and their subsequent decontamination by aHP. Fitness of respirators for reuse was assessed by qualitative and quantitative respirator fit testing on respirators subjected to multiple decontamination cycles. Real-time measurement and separate sample analyses were used to confirm acceptable aHP levels for decontamination, and the decomposition of aHP through drying prior to fit testing and reuse.",

Wherever possible, respirators already subjected to quantitative fit-testing were redirected to virologic testing in future cycles, thus conserving overall respirator consumption for the study. Successful chemical disinfection by H2O2 was confirmed using Verify\u00ae Chemical Indicators (H2O2) placed on room surfaces, behind or beneath portable equipment in the decontamination room, and on the metal racks holding the respirators. Commercial spore-based biological indicators (Geobacillus stearothermophilus) were likewise placed on or between respirator facepieces on metal racks, as well as behind or beneath portable equipment in the decontamination room. These biological indicators confirmed complete spore killing by aHP. Respirator surface concentrations of residual H2O2 were monitored via a portable monitor. These ranged from non-detectable to <0.5 ppm aHP, prior to transfer for fit-testing or sealing for virologic testing. We found that respirator movement to a \"finishing room\" was useful to support more rapid H2O2 dissipation from respirators.

We used intentional viral inoculation onto specific respirator surfaces to thoroughly test for the ability of aHP to inactivate viruses, and to discern whether any differences in respirator construction (e.g. outer vs. inner surface fabric)",

We found no evidence of viral survival of aHP decontamination. During optimization of H2O2 dwell-time parameters, we found that during a failed decontamination cycle both commercial spore-based biological tests and intensive virologic testing failed in synchrony. This suggests that medical facilities seeking to use aHP decontamination protocols can rely on spore-based methods to confirm sterilization, making this technology widely applicable beyond those with facilities capable of performing virologic testing. In ongoing work on this pilot study, we plan to maximize rigor by evaluating of up to 15 rounds of decontamination, which is the maximum use advised by the US FDA for the Battelle Decontamination VHP protocol (3, 10) .",

In terms of virion characteristics, SARS-CoV-2 has a lipid enveloped virion of ~120 nm, with no icosahedral capsid core. The lipid envelope encloses a single-stranded, linear, positive-sense RNA genome (summarized in Table 2 ). We used multiple virus species to test the viral inactivation capabilities of aHP decontamination. These viruses represented multiple characteristics of human viral pathogens, with a range of virion types and sizes, genome types and lengths, and previously documented environmental stability (21) (22) (23) . Virions of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and Pseudomonas phi6 bacteriophage have a lipid envelope, with an underlying icosahedral capsid core. In contrast, coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a non-enveloped or naked icosahedral capsid virus. Prior work has shown that naked-capsid viruses have a higher stability than enveloped viruses, thus providing a useful test of aHP sterilization abilities (21) (22) (23) . While most viruses utilized in this study are mammalian viruses requiring analysis in mammalian cell lines at biosafety level 2 (BSL2), phi6 can be assayed more flexibly, using rapid bacterial cultures (24-hour turnaround) at biosafety level 1. Phi6 is a natural pathogen phage of Pseudomonas syringae pathovar phaseolicola, which is itself a bacterial pathogen of green beans. We found that all viral species examined in this study were effectively sterilized by aHP, comparable to the decontamination observed with commercial spore-based biological indicators of sterilization. Together, this combination of respirator fit testing and virologic testing suggest that aHP is a suitable decontamination process to enable reuse of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The input inoculum for each virus was set to the maximum available in each viral stock preparation. HSV-1 and CVB3 showed a greater loss of infectiousness (plaque forming units, or PFU) due to drying than phi6. All virus species were inactivated by aHP. During optimization of aHP procedures, one cycle with short dwell time resulted in a failure of commercial spore-based biological indicators; indicating that aHP levels did not reach a sufficient level for full decontamination on that cycle.

The number of infectious units, or plaqueforming units (PFU), of virus was determined by limiting dilution onto confluent Vero detector cell monolayers (Cercopithecus aethiops monkey kidney cells, ATCC\u00ae CCL-81\u2122). Plaque formation was assessed at 72 hours post infection (hpi), after fixation and visualization of plaques using methylene blue staining. Duplicates of each virus-inoculated respirator piece were frozen for titration at a subsequent date, separate from the initial viral quantification. This allowed for experimental redundancy in terms of detector cell monolayers, and reduced handling time for the large numbers of virus-respirator inoculation sites.",

A sample of each virus-inoculated facepiece was left open to air, without aHP decontamination, as a \"dried\" virus control. The remainder of each virus-inoculated facepiece was treated with aHP for decontamination, and the virus-spotted areas were collected and tested for infectiousness thereafter",

The samples subjected to aHP decontamination appeared to have no infectious virus remaining in 55 of 58 samples tested. The only positive viral plaques to occur after aHP decontamination occurred in parallel with failure of a spore-based biological indicator, as described below. The effects of drying and inactivation did not vary substantially by either the respirator surface or location being tested, or the brand and model of respirator. No plaques were detected in the duplicate viral-spotted samples of any aHP-decontaminated respirators, for any of the three viral species. During optimization of the aHP dwell time parameter, one cycle of aHP decontamination experienced a failure on 1 of 6 spore-based biological indicators placed in the room (see Methods). On this date, there were also three samples in which either 1 or 2 viral plaques were detected (HSV-1 and CVB, respectively). These points are denoted in red Figure 1, and are likewise shown as plaques in Supplementary Figure 2. No plaques were detected in the duplicate samples of these inoculation sites, suggesting that these were either rare infectious particles or these were inactivated by freezing prior to plating of the duplicate samples. These were the only occasions on which any infectious units of any virus species were observed after aHP decontamination. Due to failure of the spore-test on that aHP cycle, respirators from this failed decontamination cycle would not have been entered into further use in a healthcare setting.",
