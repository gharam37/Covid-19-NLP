However, the current shortage in RNA extraction reagents as well as limitations in qPCR protocols have resulted in bottlenecks in testing capacity. Herein, we describe a novel molecular diagnostic for COVID-19 based on Sanger sequencing. This assay uses the addition of a frame-shifted spike-in, a modified PCR master mix, and custom Sanger sequencing data analysis to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA at a limit of detection comparable to existing qPCR-based assays, at 10-20 genome copy equivalents. Crucially, our assay was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA from viral particles suspended in transport media that was directly added to the PCR master mix, suggesting that RNA extraction can be skipped entirely without any degradation of test performance. Since Sanger sequencing instruments are widespread in clinical laboratories and commonly have built-in liquid handling automation to support up to 3840 samples per instrument per day, the widespread adoption of qSanger COVID-19 diagnostics can unlock more than 1,000,000 tests per day in the US.",

This virus first emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [1] , and spread to over 160 countries [2] . As of April 6, 2020, more than 1.3 million individuals are infected and over 70,000 deaths are reported [3] . One study found that undocumented infections were the infection source for 79% of documented cases [4] . Evidence from other reports suggests that some asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients have high levels of viral shedding [5, 6] . The substantial undocumented infection, along with the nonspecific clinical features and uncertainties in transmissibility and virulence of SARS-CoV-2, have presented significant challenges in containment of this virus. Until an effective vaccine or treatment is available, rapid, accurate, and widely available diagnostic tests not only for symptomatic patients but also for those who have come in contact with any positive cases are critical to curb the spread of the virus. However, such tests have been in limited supply in the US and many other countries in the world.",

The workflow of qSanger-based COVID-19 is highly similar to traditional Sanger sequencing of reverse transcription (RT)-PCR amplicons (Fig. 1 ), but it includes the addition of a frame-shifted synthetic COVID-19 spike-in DNA in the reaction master mix. qSanger COVID-19 is designed to support one-step reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR directly from viral transport media (VTM) of specimens, without an RNA purification step (Fig. 1A) . The amplification products are then purified and Sanger sequenced by automated capillary electrophoresis. Synthetic DNA included in RT-PCR master mix prior to PCR amplification serves as an internal control that enables specimens to be readily identified as either positive or negative for COVID-19 ( Fig. 1B-C) . Quantitative analysis of the Sanger sequence chromatogram gives qSanger an extremely high sensitivity and specificity for all positive results with a limit of detection of 10-20 genome copy equivalents (GCE), equivalent to gold-standard qPCR methods. Furthermore, the presence of a spike-in as an intra-sample control in the qSanger assay allows for easy interpretation of results and determination of sources of error (e.g. extraction or amplification or sequencing failure), and also allows population-level analyses such as mutational analysis and contact tracing. In addition, the ratio of the amplitudes of corresponding bases between the endogenous and spike-in sequences at offset positions reflects the ratio of the molecular abundances of the two sequences. Computationally combining the amplitude ratios of multiple corresponding bases can then be used to estimate the viral load over a 400-fold dynamic range with Poisson-limited coefficient of variation.",

A one-step RT-PCR mix (NEB) containing both was used to perform reverse-transcription of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and subsequent PCR amplification in one pot. In each RT-PCR, we added either nuclease-free water as a no-template control (NTC) or 100-5000 GCE of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Twist Biosciences). All reactions also contained~200 GCE of spike-in in the RT-PCR master mix. After RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing, we observed a qualitatively clean chromatogram for the spike-in sequence for the NTC condition in which no SARS-CoV-2 RNA was added ( Fig. 2A ). At the 100 GCE level, the Sanger chromatogram showed clear mixed bases corresponding to approximately equal abundance of spike-in DNA and SARS-CoV-2 RNA. At 5000 GCE SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the chromatogram exhibited a relatively pure trace for the SARS-CoV-2 target sequence, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 signal overwhelmed the spike-in signal when it was present at 50-fold greater abundance.",

Four replicates at each dilution were assayed by both qSanger and qPCR. As expected, all 4 replicates of 0 GCE were negative for COVID-19 by qPCR, and addition of 10 or more SARS-CoV-2 GCE exhibited a clear logarithmic decrease in qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) (Fig.  2B) .

Nearly all Seracare negative control samples were determined to be negative by qSanger; indeterminate results were obtained from 2 purified RNA Luna specimens and 1 purified OneTaq specimen. All Seracare positive controls were identified by qSanger except for a OneTaq direct VTM specimen (Fig. 3A ). Samples were classified as undetermined due to low chromatogram signal intensity (Signal to noise ratio < 500) or lack of sequence alignment. Possible reasons for undetermined chromatograms could be failure in RNA extraction, PCR amplification, or cycle sequencing. Since the majority of undetermined specimens used purified RNA, the possibility that the majority of assay failures were due to the RNA extraction process itself, perhaps by carryover of high salt buffers, should be considered.",

Since each reaction contained 125 GCE of Sars-CoV-2 and 200 GCE of spike-in, we expected to measure a qSanger ratio of 0.625. The OneTaq results yielded a qSanger ratio consistently around 2-3.5. This discrepancy could be due to a slightly more efficient amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence compared to spike-in sequence. Remarkably, Luna polymerase mix yielded a qSanger ratio of 0.74 +/-0.04 s.e.m. for VTM and a qSanger ratio of 0.97 +/-0.04 s.e.m. for purified RNA, which is very close to the expected ratio. The~20% difference is on par with typical imprecisions for pipetting and DNA quantification. The coefficient of variation (CV) for the VTM and RNA purified Luna assays were 12% and 16%, respectively. Notably, this is in good agreement with the imprecision associated with measuring~125 molecules at the Poisson limit. Since Luna exhibited better accuracy and precision compared to OneTaq, and the Luna direct VTM method resulted in correct calls for all NTC, Seracare positive, and negative specimens without any failed reactions, subsequent experiments were performed with Luna polymerase mix.",

Sanger chromatograms clearly showed the absence and presence of SARS-CoV-2 signal in the negative and positive controls, respectively (Fig. 4A ). The qSanger assay correctly identified the negative and positive samples in 39 out of the 40 samples tested, with 1 negative control specimen returning an undetermined result due to sequencing failure (Fig. 4B) . Overall, the excellent performance shown by our qSanger results on unextracted VTM vs. purified RNA with respect to absolute quantification accuracy, Poisson-limited coefficient of variation, and limit of detection that is comparable to gold-standard RT-qPCR, suggests that qSanger can be performed on unprocessed specimen matrix without any loss in performance. In fact, it might be possible that RNA-extraction free methods are more reliable because it eliminates the carryover risk of high-salt, PCR-inhibiting buffers used in RNA extraction procedures.",

Social distancing interventions can only be relaxed if a vaccine is developed, which is estimated to take 12 months to develop and widely distribute, or after widespread and rapid testing can be performed on symptomatic patients as well as anyone who has been identified as likely to have come into contact with those who test positive [11] .

Because qSanger is an end-point PCR reaction with an internal spike-in control, it is more robust to inhibitors that can exist in VTM, and failures in amplification result in undetermined results that require a repeat reaction, as opposed to false negatives that would be obtained by qPCR. It also has higher specificity than qPCR, as the examination of the sequencing information can be used to distinguish similar viruses and rule out false-positives due to non-specific amplifications.",

While Sanger sequencers exist in all molecular diagnostic laboratories, they are most commonly utilized in high volume in genome centers, academic sequencing core facilities, and commercial Sanger sequencing service laboratories. In this model, clinical laboratories could buy 96-well master-mix reaction plates that simply require the addition of each patient sample into a reaction well in a BioSafety Cabinet and PCR thermocycling, whereas the sequencing service laboratory would sequence the samples for next-day results. This would enable a rapidly deployed and distributed population-scale testing. qSanger also has a number of other advantages that may prove to be invaluable as we learn more information about SARS-CoV-2. Since SARS-CoV-2 mutates quickly, the availability of sequence information can be used to identify growing clusters of mutations and aid with contact tracing via phylogenetic analysis of the mutation data.

( B ) Synthetic spike-in is designed with sequence homology to the SARS-CoV-2 target so that it co-amplifies with the SARS-CoV-2 target. A 4-base pair (bp) deletion in the spike-in design enables quantification of relative abundances of spike-in and SARS-CoV-2 DNA from a Sanger sequencing chromatogram. The depicted forward and reverse primers are not to scale. ( C ) Representative Sanger sequencing traces showing pure genomic sequence (top), pure spike-in sequence (middle), and sequencing from a mixture of genomic and spike-in sequences (bottom). The spike-in used has a 4-bp offset compared to wild type (wt), which means that when two sequences are present, the signal from each sequence can be used to estimate their relative abundances (see arrows for examples of paired bases).",

            "text": "qSanger is a quantitative approach to measuring viral abundance in a sample. ( A ) Data analysis and interpretation in a qSanger COVID-19 assay. Representative Sanger sequencing chromatograms are shown for amplified products of spike-in DNA only, SarS-CoV-2 RNA only, or a mixture of the two. Since the spike-in is an internal control for amplification and sequencing, observing the spike-in signal only indicates that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was absent, and therefore the specimen is negative for COVID-19. In contrast, observing SARS-CoV-2 signal only indicates that SARS-COV-2 RNA was so abundant in the specimen that it is above the quantifiable range. In a mixed chromatogram of spike-in and SARS-CoV-2, the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is determined by the relative contributions of SARS-CoV-2 and spike-in signal intensities. ( B -D ) Synthetic viral genomic RNA was added to RT-PCR reactions at 10, 100, 1000, and 5000 GCE. The same dilutions were subjected to qSanger testing and RT-qPCR. ( B ) RT-qPCR exhibits a linear estimate across the dilution series, consistent with previous results. ( C ) Across the same dilution series, the ratio (R) of genomic sequence to spike-in sequence scales with RNA added. ( D ) When the qPCR estimate of abundance is compared to qSanger estimates of abundance, they exhibit a strong linear relationship, indicating that qSanger performs as well as qPCR in estimates of viral RNA abundance. author/funder.

Figure 3 . qSanger detects SARS-COV-2 RNA when amplified directly from viral particles in transport medium. ( A ) A total of 32 no-template controls, 32 negative control samples (Seracare) and 32 positive samples (Seracare) were assayed. All results were concordant with Seracare and NTC. Three samples were no-calls (undetermined) due to low signal-to-noise ratio in the sequencing results. ( B ) Positive Seracare samples were added to RT-PCR master mix either directly from the VTM or after purification with RNA extraction kit at 125 GCE. The ratio of reference and spike-in intensities were measured by custom data analysis. The mean qSanger ratio was 0.745 (\u00b1 0.043 s.e.m., n=8) for direct addition, and 0.97 (\u00b1 0.041 s.e.m., n=8) for purified. The coefficient of variation (CV) of positive seracare samples were measured for both Luna and OneTaq polymerase mixes. The CV for Luna direct VTM was 16.4% (n=8), and for Luna purified was 12.1% (n=8). This is consistent with the theoretical counting noise associated with quantifying ~100 molecules. author/funder.
