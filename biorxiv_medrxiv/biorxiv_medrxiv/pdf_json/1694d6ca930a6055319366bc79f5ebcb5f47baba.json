The emergence of a disease with respiratory implications in the third trimester of pregnancy is usually associated with a higher risk of C-sections, preterm births, low Apgar indexes, and low birth weight. Even though, in general, the pregnant women with COVID-19 tended to present mild respiratory symptoms, the risk of severe pneumonia during this period is high [14, 17, 18] , as well as that of adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially among those with other associated diseases such as preeclampsia or other complications because respiratory syndromes may aggravate pulmonary edema and decrease oxygen saturation [27,28].",

The infected newborn presented mild pneumonia, though the study does not clarify whether there was vertical transmission or whether transmission occurred through contact with the mother or other patients who tested positive for COVID-19. Lack of information regarding postpartum conditions, whether mother and infant were isolated, or whether the mother breastfed, among others, are the main limitations to determine routes of transmission.",

The women were aged between 22 and 42 years old and were between the 12 th and 41 st gestational weeks, explaining why only 90 infants were born in the period. The fact that most pregnant women were from China imposes a considerable challenge to interpret evidence, considering cultural and epidemiological differences when comparing with pregnant women from other countries and cultures. Even though the studies presented considerable variation in terms of the women's ages, covering virtually the entire fertile period, there is less information in terms of gestational age, with an apparent deficit concerning the first trimester of pregnancy, a time when, in terms of embryonic/fetal development, is considered of greatest vulnerability [25]. See, for instance, the case of infections caused by other viruses (Hepatitis B, Rubella, ZIKA, Varicella) [26] safeguarding phylogenetic differences.",

Even so, a single result not detected through RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 does not exclude a COVID-19 diagnosis, as there are various factors (e.g., inadequate sample collection, type of biological sample, the time elapsed between sample collection and onset of symptoms, fluctuation of viral load) that may influence a test's result. For this reason, an RT-PCR test should be repeated in another sample of a patient's respiratory tract whenever there are disagreements between results and epidemiological conditions, especially in populations where a false positive may result in disastrous consequences.",
