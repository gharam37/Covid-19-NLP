We developed a mathematical model that characterizes infections by state and incorporates inflows and outflows of interstate travelers. Modeling reveals that curbing interstate travel when the disease is already widespread will make little difference. Meanwhile, increased testing capacity (facilitating early identification of infected people and quick isolation) and strict social-distancing and self-quarantine rules are effective in abating the outbreak. The modeling has also produced state-specific information. For example, for New York and Michigan, isolation of persons exposed to the virus needs to be imposed within 2 days to prevent a broad outbreak, whereas for other states this period can be 3.6 days. This model could be used to determine resources needed before safely lifting state policies on social distancing.",

To reduce human-interactions, on March 13, a national emergency was declared; as of March 28, 39 states had issued either statewide or regionally stay-at-home or shelter-in-place order, requiring residents to stay indoors except for essential activities. To increase test capacities, on February 4, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s test, which was later to be proved inconclusive (2); on February 29, the FDA relaxed its rules for some laboratories, allowing them to start testing before the agency granting its approvals; on March 27, FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization to a medical device maker, the Abbott Labs, for the use of a coronavirus test that delivers quick testing results (3).",

Works on evaluating similar measures in other countries, especially China, started to emerge (14, 24) . For example, the effect of travel restriction on delaying the virus spread in China has been reported (9, 36) . However, it is still unclear what control and intervention measures would have actual effect, and to what extent, on abating the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. As the United States has very different political, administrative, social, pubic health and medical systems, as well as culture from China, this remains to be a critical question to address, especially considering that some measures and policies come with extremely high economic and societal costs.",

First, to localize the modeling, we developed a mathematical compartmental model system that simultaneously characterizes the spatiotemporal dynamics of infections in 51 areas (50 states and the District of Columbia). Each state or district has its own model, and all models simultaneously take into account inflows and outflows of interstate travelers. Second, to improve the practical relevance, we chose to use three parameters that can directly correspond to possible practical means to discover, combat, and control the spread of the disease, and quantify their impact on the final output of the model. The three parameters include: 1) the transmission rate b, which corresponds to the local socialdistancing enforcement, e.g., the stay-home order; 2) the detection and reporting rate r, which corresponds to the testing capacity; and 3) the travel ratio \u03b1 t , which corresponds to the ratio of interstate travel volume compared to that of 2019 during the same period.",

It consists of 51 ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems, with each one characterizing the evolution of susceptible (S), exposed (E), reported (I), unreported (A) and resolved (R) cases per state (see more details in the supplementary material and also Fig. S1 ). The 51 ODE systems are then coupled through the state-to-state travel network flows (see Fig. S2 ) that were extracted from the aggregated SafeGraph mobility data and weighted by \u03b1 t (25, 31) . Unlike most other models, we also incorporate the potential asymptomatic transmission. This makes the derivation of the basic reproduction number R 0 different. Besides, each ODE system also includes two unknown parameters: the transmission rate (b) and the report rate for each state (r). The unknown parameters are inferred based on the number of confirmed cases in each state for the period of March 1-March 20, 2020. The source of infection case data is (10) .",

For this classical data assimilation problem, we employed the Ensemble Kalman Filter method that was derived from the Kalman filter and tailored to deal with problems with high-dimensional state variables (13, 32) . The method proves to be effective when the measuring operator is linear and the underlying dynamics is Gaussian-like. It has been applied to a vast of problems that do not strictly satisfy the Gaussianity requirement. To apply this method, we generated 2000 samples according to the prior distribution, and evolve the samples through the dynamics of the ODE system.

However, this study finds that the mitigation effect that this change can bring about by itself, regarding abating the COVID-19 spread, is very limited as the outbreak has already widespread in all states. On the other hand, our modeling indicates that lowering the transmission rate and the unreported-case rate would have a great effect on abating the infection. Mapped to the public policy, this means that curbing the interstates travel alone is not going to reduce the spread of COVID-19, while the policies such as ordering stay-at-home and social distancing that reduces human interaction and increasing the testing capacities of all clinics around the nation could significantly decrease the total number of infections. While we did not conduct a rigorous economic analysis in this study, it seems reasonable to assume that producing more testing kits and conducting more tests will be significantly less expensive than completely shutting off business and curbing travels. result. By decreasing \u03b1 r from 1 to 0, we increase the report rate from the original r 0 to 1, and by decreasing \u03b1 b we decrease the transmission rate. Most states, except a few such as NY, MI, and CA, see drastic improvement when the transmission rate is decreased and the testing(reporting) rate is increased, but the reduction of interstate traffic alone is not as effective. Our modelling reveals that once the epidemic in an area has reached a certain stage, the difference that can be caused to the local situation by the relatively small number of imported cases due to the interstate travel is insignificant. According to our modeling, all states in the United States have reached that stage. Therefore, as long as those travelers follow the social-distancing rules and the local government provides sufficient testing capacity, there is no apparent urge to curb interstate travel.

On the other hand, we need to impose strong transmission-reduction intervention and increased testing capacity and report rate to contain the spread of virus. The result is in agreement with previous findings (9, 12, 14, 23, 36, 40) , suggesting that the effect of travel ban at a later stage of the outbreak is rather modest. This is also in line with the fact that the outbreaks still occurred in Europe even upon the strong travel ban on the earlier epicenter of Wuhan and its surrounding cities in China. We also show that the transmission-reduction intervention such as policies on the social-distancing and shelter-in-place rules, and the increase of testing rate, which facilitates immediate isolation upon exposure, will significantly reduce the total infected population. Such effect is mostly visible for the states of NY, NJ, MI, and IL. Particularly, our modeling results showed that for states such as NY and MI, to achieve an optimal infection reduction, a more proactive approach needs to be taken to quickly identify the exposed population and isolate them within two days of exposure in order to ensure the infection reduction.

Indeed, if the interstate travel is conducted mostly through transiting through busy airports and train stations, and the social-distancing policy is not strictly imposed, then the high population density at these places will bring up the transmission rate b locally in space and time, leading to a higher infection rate. This is a severe consequence, but it should not be counted as the direct result of relaxing travel restrictions.",
