The analysis of the relative impact of different mitigation and suppression strategies has influenced the current approach. The \"only viable strategy at the current time\" is to suppress the epidemic with all available measures, including school closures and social distancing of the entire population [3] . These analyses have highlighted from the beginning that the eventual relaxation of lock-down measures would be problematic [3, 4] . Without a considered cessation of the suppression strategies the risk of a second wave becomes signficant, possibly of greater magnitude than the first as the SARS-CoV-2 virus is now endemic in the population [5, 6] .",

Much of the discussion around antibody testing in the media has focused on the performance and number of these tests. The efficacy of this strategy however is far more dependent on the prevalence of antibodies in the general population. Without wide-scale antibody screening it's impossible to know the prevalence of antibodies in the general population, so there is scientific value in such an endeavour. However, the prevalence is the dominant factor to determine how efficacious antibody screening would be for relaxing social distancing measures.",

The analysis has explored a range for prevalence from 0.1% to 50%. Figure 5 explores the impact of a variation in sensitivity, from a test with 50% sensitivity (i.e no diagnostic value) to tests with a high sensitivity of 98%. It can be seen, considering the top half of the graphs, that the sensitivity of the test has no discernible impact on the number of infections. The prevalence entirely dominates. This is possibly counter intuitive, but as was discussed in section 2.1, even a highly accurate test produces a very large number of false positives when prevalence is low. In this case that would mean a large number of people are allowed to re-enter the population, placing them at risk, with a false sense of security that they have immunity.",

When the prevalence is low, a lower specificity of 75% not only leads to an initial large increase in the number of infections, but also, if employed throughout the year would lead to repeated peaks. This is because the active virus testing would still be employed along side the antibody testing. Falsely-diagnosed susceptible people leaving quarantine leads to a sharp rise in the number of infections. As the prevalence of virus in the non-quarantined population increases the active virus testing becomes more effective and subdues the rise in infections because the testing is more targeted on active virus cases. This would be followed by additional waves as further false positive tests for antibodies are observed. The number of people in quarantine with antibodies declines over the length of the simulation, so naturally the prevalence of immunity in the quarantined population declines. As the prevalence declines the N P V of the test declines.",

This may be desirable to some who favour increasing economic and social activity, but it is of course at the cost of further infections.

We consider a variety of rates of phased relaxations to the current quarantine. To model these rates we consider a weekly incremental transition rate from Q S to S, and Q R to R. In figure 7 , three weekly transition rates have been applied: 1%, 5% and 10% of the quarantined population.

When there is the sharpest rise in the susceptible population (i.e., high rate of transition), the virus rapidly infects a large number of people. When these people recover after two weeks they become immune and thus cannot continue the spread of the virus. However, when the infection testing is conducted with a higher capacity up to 120,000 units per day, these tests transition some active viral carriers into quarantine, so the peak is slightly delayed providing more opportunity for those released from quarantine later to be infected, leading to higher peak infections. This continues until the model reaches effective herd immunity after which the number of infected in the population decays very quickly. Having higher testing capacities delays but actually worsens the peak number of infections.",

In the generic SIR model, there are S people susceptible to the illness, I people infected, and R people who are recovered with immunity. The infected people are able to infect susceptible people at rate \u03b2 and they recover from the disease at rate \u03b3 [28] . Once infected persons have recovered from the disease they are unable to become infected again or infect others. This may be because they now have immunity to the disease or because they have unfortunately died. Figure 8 shows a schematic of the generic model formulation, and how people move between the states. Figure 9 demonstrates the typical disease dynamics, the Infected corresponding to the now well known curve that we are trying to flatten. The SIR model has two ways in which the number of new infections falls to zero. Either the number of susceptible people reduces to a point at which the disease can no longer propagate, perhaps because of a vaccine or natural immunity, or the epidemic stops if the basic reproduction rate of the disease falls below 1 due to social distancing or effective viral suppression.",

For a defined testing strategy, with an active viral test having sensitivity, specificity and capacity of \u03c3 A , \u03c4 A and C A respectively, an antibody test with sensitivity, specificity and capacity \u03c3 B , \u03c4 B and C B respectively and a testing prevalence of p, these rates are defined as follows: N A = min (C A , Bin (S + I, \u03c1)) , (6a) N B = min (C B , Bin (Q S + Q R , \u03c6)) , (6b) T I = min (N A p, Ip) , (6c) T S = min(S, N A \u2212 T I ), (6d) At each time step t, the model calculates the number of persons moving between each state in the order defined above. The use of a binomial model was prompted by a desire to incorporate both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty in each movement. The current approach does not make use of epistemic uncertainty, fixing the model parameters \u03c3 A , \u03c4 A , \u03c3 B , \u03c4 B , \u03c6, \u03c1, C A , C B and p. A discrete time model was selected to allow for comparisons against available published data detailing recorded cases and recoveries on a day-by-day basis.",

Bottom: The proportion of the population that has been released from quarantine (S + I + R population) over one year. they begin in. The model evaluations explore a range of sensitivity and specificities for the antibody testing. These sensitivity and specificities, along with the capacity for testing, govern the transition of individuals from Q R to R (true positive tests), and from Q S to S (false positive tests).Figures 5 and 6 show the results of the model evaluations. The top row of each figure corresponds to the number of infections in time, the bottom row of each figure is the proportion of the population that are released from quarantine and hence are now in the working population. Maximising this rate of reentry into the population is of course desirable, and it is widely appreciated that some increase in the numbers of infections is unavoidable. The desirable threshold in the trade-off between societal activity and number of infections is open to debate.",

The prevalence of infections in the tested population is varied among different colours. To facilitate comparison within each column of graphs, the gray curves show the results observed for other Rates and Prevalences with the same testing intensity.Diagnostic uncertainty can have a large effect on the epidemic dynamics of Covid-19 within the UK.
