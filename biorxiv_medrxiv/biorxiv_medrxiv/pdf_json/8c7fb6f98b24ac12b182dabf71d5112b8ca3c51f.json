With these data, one can quickly evaluate the effectiveness of existing diagnostics and 28 therapeutics using in silico approaches. The propensity of some viruses to rapidly accumulate 29 mutations can lead to the failure of molecular detection assays creating the need for redesigned 30 or newly designed assays.",

BioLaboro is 47 designed with a user-friendly graphical user interface for biologists with limited bioinformatics 48 experience. 49 Background 50 Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases have serious adverse impacts on society 51 with respect to lives lost and annual economic losses [1-5], as being witnessed currently in the 52 COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. As of March 9, 2020, there 53 have been 113,584 confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the globe and 3,996 deaths [6-8]. 54 Factors such as climate change, urbanization, zoonotic spillover, international travel, lack or 55 breakdown of public health care systems, natural or man-made disasters, and pathogen evolution 56 to name a few, contribute to infectious disease emergence and sustainment [2]. 57 A unique challenge associated with emerging infectious diseases is rapidly identifying 58 the etiological agent and developing or repurposing existing medical countermeasures (MCMs), 59 including diagnostic assays, to curtail the spread of an outbreak. With respect to reemerging 60 infectious diseases the challenge is to determine whether existing MCMs are effective or not, and 61 in the latter case, develop or modify the MCMs in a timely manner. In some cases, the failure of 62 existing MCMs can be accounted for by genetic drift and shift and the resulting altered genotypic 63 and phenotypic profiles of the newly emergent pathogen. Ebolavirus is one such reemerging 64 infectious disease agent that exhibits high degrees of genetic changes in every new outbreak.",

The release of WGS allowed us to test the BioLaboro pipeline (described in this study) to 137 evaluate currently used diagnostic assays and to rapidly design new assays. 138 In a previous study, we described a bioinformatics tool called PSET (PCR signature 139 erosion tool) and used it to show in silico, confirmed with wet lab work, the effectiveness of 140 existing Ebolavirus diagnostic assays against a large number of sequences available at that time 141 [32]. The phrase \"signature erosion\" used here signifies potential false-positive or false-negative 142 results in PCR assays due to mutations in the primers, probe, or amplicon target sequences (PCR 143 signatures). Signature erosion could also mean failure of medical countermeasures; for example, 144 a change in the genomic sequence resulting in an amino acid change that could potentially alter 145 the efficacy of sequence-based therapeutics [33, 34] . 146 In this study, we describe an expanded bioinformatics pipeline called BioLaboro in which 147 we have integrated several tools: BioVelocity\u00ae, Primer3 and PSET for end-to-end analysis of 148 outbreak pathogen genome sequences to evaluate existing PCR assay efficacy against the new 149 sequences, and to identify unique signature regions (BioVelocity), design PCR assays to these ",

            "text": "BioLaboro architecture 158 BioLaboro is comprised of three algorithms -BioVelocity, Primer3, and PSET -which 159 are built into a pipeline for user-friendly applications. The user has the option to launch one of 160 four different job types: Signature Discovery, Score Assay Targets, Validate Assay, or New 161 Assay Discovery. Each of the three algorithms can be run individually or together as a complete 162 end-to-end pipeline (Figure 1 ). For the BOMV use case, in the first phase of the pipeline 163 BioVelocity was used to analyze a set of genome sequences for unique regions that are both 164 conserved and signature to the target sequences selected. This was achieved by splitting a chosen 165 representative whole genome sequence into sliding 50 base pairs (bps) k-mers. Each k-mer was 166 then scanned against all target sequences to determine conservation. Conserved k-mers were then 167 elongated based on overlaps and formed into contigs. These contigs were then split into k-mers \u2264 168 250 bps and scanned against all non-target sequences to determine specificity. All passing 169 sequences were then elongated based on overlaps and the signature contigs were passed to the 170 next step in the pipeline. Primer3 was then used to evaluate the signature contigs to identify 171 suitable primers and probes for assay development. Primer3 was run in parallel against all 172 signatures and the output was ranked by penalty score in ascending order. The top five best 173 primer sets were passed along to the final step in the pipeline, PSET. In this step the primer sets 174 were run through a bioinformatics pipeline which aligned the sequences against large public 175 sequence databases from NCBI using BLAST and GLSEARCH [36] to determine how well each 176 assay correctly aligned to all target sequences while excluding off-target hits. 199 Even the two assays that passed in silico criteria did not have perfect matches raising the 200 possibility that these assays may fail in wet lab testing due to mismatches against currently 201 available BOMV genomic sequences. Hence, as described below, we designed new assays using 202 the BioLaboro platform.",

We compared the current Ebola assay signatures against the three 185 available complete genome sequences of BOMV (NCBI Accession numbers: MF319185.1, MF319186.1, and MK340750.1). Of the 30 Ebola assays examined (assay details in reference187[32]), only two met our in silico criteria for successful detection (90% identity over 90% of the 188 length for all primers and probe sequences in the amplicon).
