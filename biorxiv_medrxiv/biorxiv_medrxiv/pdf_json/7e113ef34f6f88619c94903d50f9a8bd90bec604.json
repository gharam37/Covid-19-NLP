Natural experiments are currently being conducted on the impact of these interventions, but most of these occur at the subnational level -data not available in early global datasets. We describe the rapid development of the first comprehensive, labelled dataset of 1640 NPIs implemented at federal, provincial/territorial and municipal levels in Canada to guide COVID-19 research. For each intervention, we provide: a) information on timing to aid in longitudinal evaluation, b) location to allow for robust spatial analyses, and c) classification based on intervention type and target population, including classification aligned with a previously developed measure of government response stringency. This initial dataset release (v1.0) spans January 1st, and March 31st, 2020; bi-weekly data updates to continue for the duration of the pandemic. This novel dataset enables robust, inter-jurisdictional comparisons of pandemic response, can serve as a model for other jurisdictions and can be linked with other information about case counts, transmission dynamics, health care utilization, mobility data and economic indicators to derive important insights regarding NPI impact.",

These non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been the primary tool employed by governments and organizations to reduce the spread of the virus, and avoid the possibility that peak case numbers overwhelm healthcare capacity 2, 4, 5 . In Canada, NPIs have included the closure of borders and bans on non-essential travel, as well as the imposition of voluntary or mandatory physical distancing measures.",

Regional NPI data can now be linked with other information about case counts, transmission dynamics, health care utilization, mobility data and economic indicators to derive important insights regarding NPI impact.
