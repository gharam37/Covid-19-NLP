Currently, the most validated diagnosis test for COVID-19 (RT-PCR) is in shortage in most developing countries, which may increase infection rates and delay important preventive measures. The objective of this study was to predict the risk of positive COVID-19 diagnosis with machine learning, using as predictors only results from emergency care admission exams. We collected data from 235 adult patients from the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, from 17 to 30 of March, 2020, of which 102 (43%) received a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 from RT-PCR tests. Five machine learning algorithms (neural networks, random forests, gradient boosting trees, logistic regression and support vector machines) were trained on a random sample of 70% of the patients, and performance was tested on new unseen data (30%). The best predictive performance was obtained by the support vector machines algorithm (AUC: 0.85; Sensitivity: 0.68; Specificity: 0.85; Brier Score: 0.16). The three most important variables for the predictive performance of the algorithm were the number of lymphocytes, leukocytes and eosinophils, respectively. In conclusion, we found that targeted decisions for receiving COVID-19 tests using only routinely-collected data is a promising new area with the use of machine learning algorithms.",

On the other hand, the recent increase in the usage of new rapid diagnostic tests, which are prone to some accuracy issues, may increase the risk of inefficient allocations of health resources.",

The five most important variables for the predictive performance of the algorithm according to the Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) were lymphocytes, leukocytes, eosinophils, basophils and hemoglobin, respectively. We also tested the performance of the algorithms using 10-fold cross validation repeated 10 times for each algorithm, instead of using the 70-30 split. This strategy is frequently used in machine learning in health studies especially in cases of relatively small samples such as ours, but it simulates less clearly the results in clinical applications. The predictive performance of the algorithms was better in comparison with the previous strategy, with an AUC of 0.87, Sensitivity of 0.755 and Specificity of 0.829 for the best-performing algorithm, which was again the support vector machines (Annex 1).",
