Despite their accuracy for single sample analysis, infectious diseases diagnostic tools, like RT-PCR, require substantial resources to test large populations. We develop a scalable approach for determining the viral status of pooled patient samples. Our approach converts group testing to a linear inverse problem, where false positives and negatives are interpreted as generated by a noisy communication channel, and a message passing algorithm estimates the illness status of patients. Numerical results reveal that our approach estimates patient illness using fewer pooled measurements than existing noisy group testing algorithms. Our approach can easily be extended to various applications, including where false negatives must be minimized. Finally, in a Utopian world we would have collaborated with RT-PCR experts; it is difficult to form such connections during a pandemic. We welcome new collaborators to reach out and help improve this work!",

RT-PCR is a labor intensive technical procedure that requires numerous trained laboratory personnel to analyze one patient sample [1] . Briefly, ribonucleic acid (RNA) is isolated from a patient's respiratory tract and purified for reverse transcription, a process where the RNA template is turned into complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA). cDNA, along with specific viral primers, is loaded into a machine, where cDNA is amplified and annealed to the target sequence. While extending through each PCR cycle, a reporter dye is cleaved or broken from a probe to amplify fluorescence intensity and reveal a positive sample.",

First, to increase the accuracy of testing for each individual patient by combining information from multiple pooled measurements that sample genetic material from that same individual. Second, to use a reduced number of measurements, especially in settings where a large population is being tested, most patients are healthy, and so many individual measurements will come out negative and thus show that multiple patients are healthy. In summary, group testing allows to evaluate large populations at high throughput, low per-patient diagnostic costs, and low false positive and negative probabilities.",

Their model for PCR uses Pr(Y m = 0|W m > 0) = (1 \u2212 p 2 )p 1 , while we use Pr(Y m = 0|W m = w m > 0) = (1 \u2212 p 2 )p wm 1 ; we evaluated their approach using \u03c1 = 0.01, p 1 = 0.02, and p 2 = 0.001. Hanel and Thurner's Part 1 pools a block of B = 11 patients at a time. If a pool is negative, all patients in the block are declared healthy; else A simulation over N = 10 7 patients had 935 false positives and 4038 false negatives. Our two part approach modifies Part 2. Instead of testing patients within each positive block individually, we combine all patients within all positive blocks into a new linear inverse problem, and solve the resulting estimation problem (1) with GAMP. For example, let the block size be B = 25 patients in Part 1. In Part 2, we combine all positive blocks and apply R = 0.5 and n pos = 0.5 to the linear inverse problem. Note that (i) positive measurements from Part 1 are reused in the matrix A and measurement vector y of Part 2, because they contain information that helps GAMP; (ii) we decide whether a patient is sick or not by thresholding x. Combining Parts 1 and 2, the measurement rate is R = 0.149. We randomly generate 100 (x, y, A) triples for N = 10000 patients in Part 1, Among 100N = 10 6 patients, there are 92 false positives and 366 false negatives. Our false positive and negative rates are both lower than those of Hanel and Thurner [3] .",

It might be possible to use different matrix entry values (not just 0 and 1) and thus sample more genetic material in some cases, and less in others. This will likely result in p 1 depending on the amount of genetic matter being sampled. Therefore, genetic material will have to be measured before samples are pooled to ensure the same concentration of genetic material is loaded for each sample. Limiting the amount of genetic matter being processed may reduce the costs of the overall measurement process. On the other hand, if the amount of genetic material per patient per measurement varies, a sophisticated channel could be supported by having nonzeros in A mn take different values.",

Alternately, p 2 may depend on the measurement system, for example the number of samples pooled together, or the number of RT-PCR iterations. If individual RT-PCR iterations are costly, then the number of iterations can be reduced, resulting in larger p 2 . Our experience with AMP-based algorithms suggests that a modest increase in R = M/N will compensate for the degraded individual measurements. Cost effectiveness of each iteration will determine the number of times each sample can be run. This value should be weighed against the number of times individual samples are pooled, allowing to optimize the number of samples pooled per measurement\u00e0 la [3] .",

Therefore, each measurement provides the same signal to noise ratio (SNR). One matrix design option is to allow different rows and columns to have different numbers of nonzeros. Another is to prevent any pair of patients, n 1 and n 2 , from both having nonzero matrix entries in different rows, m 1 and m 2 , i.e., A m1n1 , A m1n2 , A m2n1 , and A m2n2 cannot all be nonzero.
