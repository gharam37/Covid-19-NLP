As of April 4, 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than 11,16,643 confirmed infections and more than 59,170 reported deaths worldwide. The main focus of this paper is two-fold: (a) generating short term (real-time) forecasts of the future COVID-19 cases for multiple countries; (b) risk assessment (in terms of case fatality rate) of the novel COVID-19 for some profoundly affected countries by finding various important demographic characteristics of the countries along with some disease characteristics. To solve the first problem, we presented a hybrid approach based on autoregressive integrated moving average model and Wavelet-based forecasting model that can generate short-term (ten days ahead) forecasts of the number of daily confirmed cases for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. The predictions of the future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective allocation of health care resources and will act as an early-warning system for government policymakers. In the second problem, we applied an optimal regression tree algorithm to find essential causal variables that significantly affect the case fatality rates for different countries. This data-driven analysis will necessarily provide deep insights into the study of early risk assessments for 50 immensely affected countries.",

The COVID-19 pandemic is the most significant global crisis since the World War-II that affected almost all the Countries of our planet [4] . As of April 4, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in 11, 16, 643 confirmed cases with reported deaths of 59,170 worldwide [22] . On March 11, WHO publicly characterized COVID-19 as a \"global pandemic\", and shortly after that, the United States declared COVID-19 outbreaks a national emergency. The COVID-19 has caused a great threat to the health and safety of people all over the world due to its widespread and potential harm. Thus, the studies of the novel COVID-19 epidemics and its future development trend has become a cutting-edge research topic at this moment. We are therefore motivated to ask: (a) Can we generate real-time forecasts of daily new COVID-19 cases for countries like Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK? (b) What are the probable causal variables that have significant impacts on the case fatality rates for the profoundly affected countries?",

            "text": "To answer the first question, we study classical and modern forecasting techniques for which the prediction accuracy largely depend on the availability of data [28] . In outbreaks of COVID-19 epidemics, there are limited data available, making predictions widely uncertain. From previous studies, it was evident that the timing and location of the outbreak facilitated the rapid transmission of the virus within a highly mobile population [29] . In most of the affected countries, the governments implemented a strict lockdown in subsequent days of initial transmission of the virus and within hospitals, patients who fulfill clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 are immediately isolated. The constant increase in the global number of COVID-19 cases is putting a substantial burden on the health care system for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. To anticipate additional resources to combat the epidemic, various mathematical and statistical forecasting tools [21; 34] and outside China [20; 36; 10] were applied to generate short-term and long-term forecasts of reported cases. These model predictions have shown a wide range of variations. Since the time series datasets of COVID-19 contain both nonlinear and nonstationary patterns, therefore, making decisions based on an individual model would be critical. In this study, we propose a hybrid modeling approach to generate short-term forecasts for multiple countries. In traditional time series forecasting, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is used predominantly for forecasting linear time series [6] . But in recent literature, the wavelet transformation based forecasting model has shown excellent performance in nonstationary time series data modeling [27] . Thus, combining both models may accurately model such complex autocorrelation structures in the COVID-19 time-series datasets and reduce the bias and variances of the prediction error of the component models. In the absence of vaccines or antiviral drugs for COVID-19, these estimates will provide an insight into the resource allocations for the exceedingly affected countries to keep this epidemic under control. Besides shedding light on the dynamics of COVID-19 spreading, the practical intent of this data-driven analysis is to provide government officials with realistic estimates for the magnitude of the epidemic for policy-making.",

Mortality is crudely estimated using a statistic, the case fatality rate (CFR), which divides the number of known deaths by the total number of identified cases [18; 5; 30] . During the current phase of this global pandemic, it is criti-cally important to obtain reliable estimates of the overall CFR. The estimates of CFR are highly dependent on several country-specific demographic parameters and various disease characteristics. A key differentiation among the CFR of different countries can be found by determining an exhaustive list of causal variables that significantly affect CFR. In this work, we put an effort to identify critical parameters that may help to assess the risk (in terms of CFR) using an optimal regression tree model [7] . The regression tree has a built-in variable selection mechanism from high dimensional variable space and can model arbitrary decision boundaries. The regression tree combines case estimates, epidemiological characteristics of the disease, and heath-care facilities to assess the risks of major outbreaks for profoundly affected countries. Such assessments will help to anticipate the expected morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 and provide some critical information for the planning of health care systems in various countries facing this epidemic.",

This property overcomes the basic drawback of Fourier analysis and wavelet transforms the original signal data (especially in the time domain) into a different domain for data analysis and processing. Wavelet-based models are most suitable for nonstationary data, unlike ARIMA [23] . Most epidemic and climatic time-series datasets are nonstationary; therefore, wavelet transforms are used as a forecasting model for these datasets [11; 2] . When conducting wavelet analysis in the context of time series analysis, the selection of the optimal number of decomposition levels is vital to determine the performance of the model in the wavelet domain. The following formula for the number of decomposition levels, W L = int[log(n)] is used to select the number of decomposition levels, where n is the time-series length. The wavelet-based forecasting (WBF) model transforms the time series data by using a hybrid maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) algorithm with a 'haar' filter. Daubechies wavelets can produce identical events across the observed time series in so many fashions that most other time series prediction models cannot recognize [3] .

We have used root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), to evaluate the predictive performance of the models used in this study [17] . Since the number of data points in both the datasets is limited thus going for advanced deep learning techniques will simply over-fit the datasets [14] . We start the experimental evaluation for all the five datasets with the classical ARIMA(p,d,q) using 'forecast' [16] statistical package in R software. To fit an ARIMA model, we first specify the parameters of the model. Using ACF plot and PACF plot (See Table 1 ), we can decide the value of the parameters of the model. We have also performed unit root tests for stationarity check and all the datasets were found nonstationary. The 'best' fitted ARIMA model is chosen using AIC and BIC values for each training dataset. The fitted ARIMA models for five datasets are as follows: ARIMA(1,2,1) for India, ARIMA(1,1,2) for Canada, ARIMA(0,1,1) for France, ARIMA(2,1,0) for South Korea, and ARIMA(2,2,2) for the UK. We employ a pre-defined Box-Cox transformation set to \u03bb = 0 to ensure the forecast values stay positive. As the ARIMA model is fitted, forecasts are generated for 10-time steps (5 April 2020 to 14 April 2020) for all the five datasets. We also compute training data predicted values and calculate the residual errors. Plots for the residual series are given in Figure 1 .",

These seasonal oscillations can be captured through the wavelet transform, which can decompose a time series into a linear combination of different frequencies. These residual series as in Figure 1 ) satisfy the admissibility condition (zero mean) that forces wavelet functions to wiggle (oscillate between positive and negative), a typical property of wavelets. Thus, we remodel the residuals obtained using the ARIMA model with that of the WBF model. The value of Wavelet levels is obtained by using the formula, as mentioned in Algorithm 1. WBF model was implemented using 'WaveletArima' [26] package in R software with 'periodic' boundary and all the other parameters were kept as default. As the WBF model is fitted on the residual time series, predictions are generated for the next ten time steps (5 April 2020 to 14 April 2020). Further, both the ARIMA forecasts and WBF residual forecasts are added together to get the final out-of-sample forecasts for the next ten days (5 April 2020 to 14 April 2020).

Previous studies [22; 30; 18; 5] have suggested that the total number of cases, age distributions, and shutdown period have high impacts on the CFR values for some of the countries. Along with these three variables, we also considered seven more demographic structures and disease characteristics for these countries as input variables that are likely to have a potential impact on the CFR estimates. Therefore, the CFR modeling dataset consists of 50 observations having ten possible causal variables and one numerical output variable (viz. CFR), as reported in Table 3 . The possible causal variables considered in this study are the followings: the total number of COVID-19 cases (in thousands) in the country till 4 April, 2020, population density per km 2 for the country, total population (in millions) of the country (approx.), percentage of people in the age group of greater than 65 years, lockdown days count (from the starting day of lockdown till April 4, 2020), time-period (in days) of COVID-19 cases for the country (starting date to April 4, 2020), doctors per 1000 people in the country, hospital beds per 1000 people in the country, income standard (e.g., high or lower) of the country and climate zones (e.g., tropical, subtropical or moderate) of the country.

Rt, as a widely used simple machine learning algorithm, can model arbitrary decision boundaries. The methodology outlined in [7] can be summarized into three stages. The first stage involves growing the tree using a recursive partitioning technique to select essential variables from a set of possible causal variables and split points using a splitting criterion. The standard splitting criteria for RT is the mean squared error (MSE). After a large tree is identified, the second stage of RT methodology uses a pruning procedure that gives a nested subset of trees starting from the largest tree grown and continuing the process until only one node of the tree remains. The cross-validation technique is popularly used to provide estimates of future prediction errors for each subtree. The last stage of the RT methodology selects the optimal tree that corresponds to a tree yielding the lowest cross-validated or testing set error rate. To avoid instability of trees in this stage, trees with smaller sizes, but comparable in terms of accuracy, are chosen as an alternative. This process can be tuned to obtain trees of varying sizes and complexity. A measure of variable importance can be achieved by observing the drop in the error rate when another variable is used instead of the primary split. In general, the more frequent a variable appears as a primary split, the higher the importance score assigned. A detailed description of the tree building process is available at [17] .",

We apply an optimal RT model to the dataset consisting of 50 different country samples and try to find out potential casual variables from the set of available variables that are related to the case-fatality rates. RT is implemented using 'rpart' [31] package in R with \"minsplit\" equals to 10% of the data as a control parameter. We have used RMSE, co-efficient of multiple determination (R 2 ), and adjusted R 2 (AdjR 2 ) to evaluate the predictive performance of the tree model used in this study [17] . An optimal regression tree is built with 7 variables with 'minsplit' = 5 with equal costs for each variable. The estimates of the performance metrics for the fitted tree are as follows: RMSE = 0.013, R 2 = 0.896, and AdjR 2 = 0.769. A variable importance list from the RT is given in Figure 7 and the fitted tree is provided in Figure 8 .",

These seven causal variables that significantly affect the CFR for 50 most affected countries are the followings: total number of COVID-19 cases in the country (in thousands), percentage of people in the age group of greater than 65 years, total population (in millions) of the country, doctors per 1000 people in the country, lockdown period (in days) for the country, time-period (in days) of COVID-19 cases for the country, and hospital beds per 1000 people in the country. Our results are consistent with previous results obtained by [30; 18; 5] , where the authors suggested that the total number of cases, age distributions, and shutdown period have high impacts on the CFR estimates. But interestingly, we obtained four more essential causal variables that will provide some new insights into the study of risk assessments for COVID-19 affected countries. Out of these 7 numerical input variables, there are four control variables (number of cases, people of age group > 65 years, lockdown period, and hospital beds per 1000 people) present that can be managed to fight against this deadly disease. Once these variables are taken care of, the respective country may reduce their case fatality rate at a significant rate. x.x3",

Along in this line, we presented two different approaches to deal with two inter-connected problems on COVID-19. In the first problem of short-term predictions for COVID-19 outbreak in five countries, we proposed a hybrid methodology combining ARIMA and WBF models. In the second problem of risk assessment, we found some important factors affecting case fatality rates of COVID for 50 highly affected nations. However, there may exist a few more controllable factor(s), and some disease-based characteristics that can also have an impact on the value of CFR for different countries, can be regarded as future scope of the study.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 outbreaks globally present a significant challenge for modelers, as there are limited data available on the early growth trajectory, and epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we considered two alarmingly important problems relevant to ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The first problem deals with the real-time forecasts of the daily COVID-19 cases in five different countries. We proposed a hybrid ARIMA-WBF model that can explain the nonlinear and nonstationary behavior present in the univariate time series datasets of COVID-19 cases. Ten days-ahead forecasts are provided for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. The proposed model can be used as an early warning system to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Below we present a list of suggestions based on the results of the real-time forecasts.1. Since we presented a real-time forecast system unlike an ex-post analysis, thus one can regularly update the actual confirmed cases and update the predictions, just like it happens in weather forecasting. 2. The forecasts mostly show oscillating behavior for the next 10 days and reflect the impact of the broad spectrum of social distancing measures implemented by the governments, which likely helped stabilize the epidemic. 3. The short-term forecasts don't necessarily show any stiff decay sooner; also, these five countries are not going to face any unlike uplifts in the number of cases too. 4. Guided by the short-term forecasts reported in this paper, the lockdown period can be adjusted accordingly.Secondly, we assessed the risk of COVID-19 by finding seven key parameters that are expected to have powerful associations with that of case fatality rates. This is done by designing an optimal regression tree model, a simplified machine learning approach. The model is very flexible, easily interpretable, and the more data will come, one can just incorporate the new data sets and rebuild the trees to get the updated estimates. RT provides a better visual representation and is easily interpretable to be understood by a broader audience. Quantification of the outbreak risks and their dependencies on the key parameters will support the governments and policymakers for the planning of health care systems in different countries that faced this epidemic. Experimental results suggest four control variables out of seven highly influential variables that will have a significant impact on controlling CFR. Below we present a point by point discussion of the control variables affecting CFR and preventive actions to be taken by the governments.1.
