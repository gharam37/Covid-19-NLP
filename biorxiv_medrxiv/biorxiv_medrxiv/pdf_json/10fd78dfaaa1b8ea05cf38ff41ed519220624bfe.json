During the early transmission 34 phase, the basic reproduction number, R0, represents such a measurement quantifying the average number 35 of secondary cases that primary cases generate in a completely susceptible population in the absence of 36 interventions or behavioral changes. R0>1 indicates the possibility of sustained transmission, whereas 37 R0<1 implies that transmission chains cannot sustain epidemic growth. As the epidemic continues its 38 course, the effective reproduction number, Re, offers a time-dependent record of the average number of 39 secondary cases per case as the number of susceptible individuals gets depleted and control interventions 40 takes effect. Herein we employed two different methods to quantify the reproduction number using the 41 curve of reported COVID-19 cases in Iran and its five regions (Table S1) . 42",
