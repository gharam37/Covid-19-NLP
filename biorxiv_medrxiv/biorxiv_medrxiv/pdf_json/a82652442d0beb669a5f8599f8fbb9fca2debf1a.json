SARS CoV-2 uses TMPRSS 2 in the same way as SARS-CoV is used Membrane Glycoproteins proteins inside the Golgi system are glycosylated. The modification of the M protein is essential for the virion to attach into the cell and make antigenic protein (de Haan et al., 2003) The protein M plays a key role in the cell's regeneration of virions. N protein forms a complex by binding to genomic RNA and M protein activates the development of interacting virions in this intermediate endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi interface (ERGIC) compartment with this complex (de Haan et al.,1998 ; Escorset al., 2001) Envelop Glycoproteins are tiny proteins consisting of around 76 to 109 amino acids. Approximately 30 amino acids in the E protein N-terminus allow attachment to the virus membrane (Raamsman et al., 2000) Additionally, coronavirus E proteins play a critical role in virion assembly and morphogenesis within the cell. For one research coronavirus E and M proteins were expressed for conjunction with vectors of mammalian expression to form virus-like structures inside the cell (Baudoux et al., 1998; Vennema et al., 1996) In another review, the ability of recombinant mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS viruses to generate E protein expression in the genome to sustain this status has been significantly reduced (Kuo et al., 2003; DeDiego. et al 2007) N Proteins are helix-capable phosphoproteins with a versatile viral genomic RNA structure. It plays an important role in coronavirus virion assembly, replication and transcription, as the N protein locates both the coronavirus replication / transcription region and the ERGIC region where the virus is collected (Stertzet al., 2007) In this paper, we tried to describe the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 by the use of bioinformatics tools",

The envelope, surface and membrane glycoprotein is rich in Leucine so have more affinity to the host cell receptor surface as stated in Luo et al, 1999 . Although glycine is more in nucleocapside phosphoprotein, researchers should be able to isolate the protein with little effort along with these data and iso-electric point value. Higher molecular weight of the surface glycoprotein suggests that its tertiary structure may contain strong amino acid side chains.Instability index surface, membrance and envelop glycoprotein is stable and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein is highly unstable Leaving the surface Glycoprotaein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein all other protein are hydrophobic in nature. The prediction of trans-membrane in all structural proteins except Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein shows the virus ability to reach the host with ease. This fairly simple method may help us understand how antivirals and vaccines could be produced against it Furthermore, as a beginning for docking studies (small and large scale) we are now offering homology models, Diverse knowledge of the molecular biology of SARS COV_2 is required to .
