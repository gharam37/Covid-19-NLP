As countries respond to the pandemic, it is urgent to predict disease epidemic and compare containment and mitigation efforts between countries to investigate their impacts on infection rates.

We found several infectious disease models for epidemic in China, other Asian countries, and Europe, and predictions of mortality rate and hospital demands in United Kingdom and United States. A few studies have investigated the impact of control measures based on simulations. However, existing models for COVID-19 are based on susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) models for prior influenza and SARS epidemics, which involve a large number of parameters and may susceptible to perturbation in parameters.

We construct our model based on prior scientific knowledge about COVID-19, instead of post-hoc observations of the trend of disease spread. Specifically, two important facts we consider include (1) the virus has an incubation period up to 14-21 days 1 and a patient can be highly infectious even without symptoms; (2) infection rate varies over time and can change significantly when the public responds to government guidelines and intervention strategies.",

Our model accounts for major characteristics of COVID-19 (long incubation period and highly contagious during incubation) with a small number of parameters (up to five) and assumptions, directly targets prediction accuracy, and provide measures of uncertainty and inference based on permuting the residuals. We allow infection rate to depend on time and modify the basic reproduction number R 0 as a time-dependent measure R t to estimate change in disease transmission over time. Thus, R t corrects for the naturally impact of time on the disease spread. Our estimated reproduction number at the beginning of the epidemic ranges from 2\u00b739 to 5\u00b737, which is consistent with R 0 reported in other studies 18 (range 1\u00b740 and 6\u00b749, with a median of 2\u00b779).",

The starting reproduction number in South Korea is high possibly due to many cases linked to patient 31 and outbreaks at church gatherings. Similarly for China, the reproduction number was reduced to below 1\u00b70 in 14 days. Italy's R t decreased until almost reaching 1\u00b70 on March 25, but remains around 1\u00b70.

Under this assumption, the intervention is not effective to reduce the transmission speed (slopes of a(t) are similar before and after lockdown on March 11). There were 10,149 cases reported in Italy as of March 10, suggesting that the lockdown was placed after the wide community spread had already occurred. Nevertheless, it is possible that without the lockdown the infection rate would have had increased, i.e., the lockdown enhanced and maintained the effect of quarantine for two weeks. In fact, after two weeks of lockdown, we observe a loss of temporal effect so that R t has remained above 1\u00b70, suggesting that the epidemic is not yet under control.

There were two outlier days (February 12, 13) with a total of 19,198 cases reported. These two days were not used in our training data. Excluding two outliers, the observed number of cases was 62,356 and close to prediction. For South Korea, Figure 2 shows that the model captures the general trend of the epidemic except at the tail area (after March 15) where some small and enduring outbreak was observed. The predicted number of new cases at the peak was 665 and the total number of predicted cases at the peak time was close to the observed total (4,300 vs 4,335). The reproduction number decreased dramatically from 5\u00b737 at the beginning of the outbreak to below 1\u00b70 in 14 days (Figure 4b).
