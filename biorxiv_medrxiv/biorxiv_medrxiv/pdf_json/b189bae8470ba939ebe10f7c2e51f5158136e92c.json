Here, we describe the identification and evaluation of 18 commercially available reagents and assays for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 19 infected formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cell pellets. We identified a suitable rabbit 20 polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV spike protein antibody and a mouse monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV 21 nucleocapsid protein (NP) antibody for cross detection of the respective SARS-CoV-2 proteins 22 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Next, we established 23 RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Furthermore, we established 24 a multiplex fluorescence ISH (mFISH) to detect positive-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA and negative-25 sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA (a replicative intermediate indicating viral replication).

However, although the COVID-19 pandemic 45 may have begun with a bat-to-human transmission event, it appears that close to all human 46 infections trace back to respiratory droplets produced by infected people and fomites (respiratory 47 droplet landing sites) (10, 11). Human infections lead to various degrees of disease severity, 48 ranging from asymptomatic infection or mild symptoms to fatal pneumonia. Older patients or 49 patients with chronic medical conditions are more vulnerable to becoming critically ill with poor 50 prognosis (12).

We identified six antibodies, including three rabbit 84 polyclonal antibodies, against SARS-CoV S, one rabbit polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV 85 nucleocapsid protein (NP), and one rabbit and one mouse monoclonal antibody against CoV NP that may cross react with SARS-CoV-2 (Supplemental Table 1 ).

After rinsing 194 with PBS, pH 7.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), sections were blocked overnight with CAS-Block 195 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 5% normal goat serum (MilliporeSigma) at 4\u00b0C. Sections 196 were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV S (Sino Biological, 197 #40150-T62-COV2) at dilution 1:500 and mouse monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV NP 198 (Sino Biological, 40143-MM05) at a dilution 1:500 for 2 h at room temperature. After rinsing in 199 PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween-20, MilliporeSigma), sections were incubated with secondary goat 200 IgG Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody and with goat IgG Alexa Fluor 561-201 conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections 202 were cover-slipped using VECTASHIELD antifade mounting medium with DAPI (Vector 203 Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA).

To detect SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA in FFPE tissues, ISH was performed using the 207 RNAscope 2.5 HD RED kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA, USA) according to the 208 manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, forty ZZ ISH probes (#854841, positive-sense RNA probe 209 1) with C1 channel and twenty ZZ ISH probes (#848561, positive-sense RNA probe 2)",
