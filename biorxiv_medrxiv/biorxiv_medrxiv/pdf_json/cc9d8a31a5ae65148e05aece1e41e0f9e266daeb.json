However, if collected over country or regional scales, these metrics hide important smaller-scale, local dynamics. We examine how commonly used epidemiological metrics differ for each individual state within the United States during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. We found that the case number, and trajectory of cases, differs considerably between states. We show that early non-pharmaceutical, government actions, were the most important determinant of epidemic dynamics. In particular, restricting restaurant operations was correlated with increased doubling times. Although individual states are clearly not independent, they can serve as small, natural experiments in how different demographic patterns and government responses can impact the course of an epidemic.",

            "text": "The global COVID-19 (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus) outbreak began in Wuhan, China in late 2019 (WHO 2020). As of April 12 th , 1,846,679 cases have been reported across 185 countries and regions. There have been several sets of efforts to track the progression of the outbreak across the world and within countries. For example, John Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) has compiled data from various sources, including the US Center for Disease Control and the World Health Organization, to present a global picture of COVID-19 cases and deaths (Dong et al. 2020 ). These efforts have allowed for international scientific research and political decision-making. Although data are collected at local scales (e.g. within hospitals), in an emerging pandemic, data are typically reported at the country level. This allows for interesting comparisons between countries (Anderson et al. 2020 , Jombart et al. 2020 ) and for information from an earlier affected country to be used to slow the outbreak in other places. For instance, South Korea was able to \"flatten their outbreak curve\" through early and widespread testing as well as strict quarantine policies (Utsunomiya et al. 2020 ). However, country-level analyses still hide more local dynamics that are important to the overall epidemic progression (Chin et al. 2020 , Lin et al. 2020 ).",

Therefore, although states are not independent units, we can use state-level data to understand the progression of the outbreak across different replicates within a country (Adolph et al. 2020) . We show that across measures of demography, education, health, and wealth, only population density was correlated with doubling time.

To properly compare the progression of the epidemic across states, we looked at the log number of cases since the first day a state reported 25 (after which exponential curves were more reliable) cases (Fig. 1) .

Except for population density and percent of population living in rural areas, we found that demography, education, and wealth were poor predictors of the state-level overall doubling times (Fig. 2, Table 1 ). Therefore, we also examined the correlation between doubling time and state government interventions. We used information collected by Adolph et al. (2020) on whether or not a state had implemented a specific action by the first day they had 25 or more cases. We adjusted this number to 150 cases for more severe restrictions like closing all non-essential business or stay at home mandates). We looked at closing of public schools, limiting large gatherings (usually of more than 10 people), restricting business, and stay at home orders (Adolph et al. 2020) . Of these factors, only restricting businesses, specifically restaurants, was a significant predictor of doubling time (Fig. 3, Table 1 ). These restrictions were also additive, as states that implemented more actions early had higher doubling times (Fig. 3) . The ordering of these restrictions was also fairly consistent between states (Fig. 4) . While declaring a state of emergency is an obvious first intervention, closing public schools tend to be implemented at different times across states. More importantly, by the time government restrict businesses and declare a stay-at-home order, all other interventions tend to have already been implemented (Fig. 4, Adolph et al. (2020) ).",

A state with a high tightness score has \"many strongly enforced rules and little tolerance for deviance\" (Harrington & Gelfand 2014) . We expected that states with highly enforced rules should have higher doubling times compared to \"loose\" states. Instead, we found that opposite where tight states had low doubling times and faster disease spread. We hypothesis this may be the result of people in tight cultures finding it more difficult to adjust their behavior when new rules are imposed. More work has to be done to understand this relationship.",
