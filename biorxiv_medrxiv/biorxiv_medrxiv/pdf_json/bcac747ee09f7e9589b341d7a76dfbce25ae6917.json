            "text": "The components of the RTC include enzymes that regulate mRNA and genomic RNA synthesis, proofreading, and mRNA maturation. Two of these enzymes are critical for capping viral mRNAs, a tactic employed by multiple RNA viruses to avoid immune detection by toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) (15) . In eukaryotic cells, mRNA capping is initiated by an RNA triphosphatase (TPase), which removes the \u03b3-phosphate from the 5'-end of the nascent mRNA transcript, generating a diphosphate 5'-ppN end. An RNA guanylyltransferase (GTase) subsequently catalyzes the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate (PPi) from a guanidine . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license author/funder.

The GpppN formation is followed by N 7 -methylation of the capping guanylate by a guanine-N 7 -methyltransferase (N 7 -MTase) to generate the Cap-0. Further methylation at the ribose 2'-O position of first nucleotide of the RNA is catalyzed by a ribose 2'-O-methyltransferases (2'-O-MTase) to generate Cap-1 and sometimes at the second nucleotide to generate Cap-2 (4). Both the N 7 -MTase and 2'-O-MTase use S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as the methyl group donor (4, 16) .",

Nsp14 is a bifunctional enzyme with an exonuclease domain in addition to its N 7 -MTase domain (17) . Its activity is modulated by the binding of the small viral protein, nsp10, which specifically stimulates its exonuclease activity with no effect on its N 7 -MTase activity (16) . The coronavirus mRNAs are further modified to have a Cap-1 by the viral non-structural protein 16 (nsp16). Nsp16 is a m 7 GpppA-specific, SAM-dependent, 2'-O-MTase (18, 19) and is activated by binding to nsp10 (20) . Nsp10 is a stable protein that can self-dimerize (5) or form dodecamers with nsp11 (6), in addition to modulating nsp14 and nsp16 activity (21) . Although no specific enzymatic activity has been identified for nsp10, it is known as a zinc binding protein that binds nonspecifically to RNA and stabilizes the SAM binding pocket in nsp16 to form a stable complex (20) . The nsp10-nsp16-mediated 2'-O-methylation of coronavirus RNA is essential for preventing host recognition and decreasing immune response, while the viral RNA is translated (16, 18, 22) .",

Nsp10 is released from pp1a and pp1ab, while nsp16 is part of only the pp1ab polyprotein created after a -1 ribosome shift (24) . Previous studies from SARS-CoV-1 demonstrated that nsp16 is an unstable protein in several conditions and thus the protein was purified in complex following co-expression with nsp10 (25). Here, we successfully expressed and purified nsp10 and nsp16 separately using nickel affinity and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). After removal of the 6xHis-tags, a heterodimer of nsp16 with nsp10 was formed and concentrated by centrifugation across a 30 kDa cutoff membrane and dialyzed into crystallization buffer.

The ultimate goal is to identify viral proteins that are amenable for drug targeting and epitopes suitable for vaccine development. Although, previous studies conducted in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV enlighten the pathway for drug discovery and vaccine development, no approved treatments were fully developed. In addition, due to the high replication error rate of ssRNA viruses, small amino acid variations could cause resistance to previously described compounds or increase the pathogenicity. Thus, in order to ensure an accurate approach for drug discovery, the CSGID implemented a structural genomics pipeline to solve the structure of proteins essential for the .

Here we presented the structure of the 2\u00a2-O-MTase, nsp10-nsp16 heterodimer in complex with SAM at 1.8 \u00c5 resolution, which shares 98% identity with the 2\u00a2-O-MTase of SARS-CoV-1. All the amino acid variations in the new SARS-CoV-2 were located at the solvent exposed surface of the heterodimer, and not among the residues of the catalytic site, substrate binding site, or interface between nsp10-nsp16. Furthermore, the only identified discrepancies in our model versus previous models were in the flexible loop regions 28-38 and 131-148 and the N-and C-terminal residues. Notedly, these residues were derived from SARS-CoV-1 nsp10 fusion to nsp11. As the 2\u00a2-O-MTase activity of nsp10-nsp16 is required for viral replication-transcription in host cells, these structural data can be used for developing new specific treatments against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, the structure reported here is the highest resolution structure thus far of a coronavirus 2\u00a2-O-MTase and is amenable for computational modeling of potential inhibitors.",

All of these ligands, except the MTase co-factor SAM and two Zinc ions, are derived from the crystallization and freezing solutions. It is likely that their interaction with the protein complex results from its electrostatic potential, as predicted by the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver program(26) and modeled as vacuum surface electrostatics in the software package PyMOL. For example, one of the ACT molecules interacts in the positively charged nucleotide binding groove(Fig. 1C).Structure of nsp10.The structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 consist of residues 19-133 (residues 4272-4392 of pp1a). It contains a positively charged and hydrophobic surface that interacts with a hydrophobic pocket and a negatively charged surface from nsp16, which contributes to the stabilization of the SAM binding site(Fig. 1C). The structure of nsp10 of SARS-CoV-2 is composed of a central anti-parallel pair of b-strands surrounded on one side by a crossover large loop. The other side is a helical domain with loops that form two zinc fingers(Figure 2 A). These structures are involved in the non-specific binding of RNA in other coronaviruses(4,27).The Znbinding site 1 is coordinated by the residues C74, C77, H83 and C90.
