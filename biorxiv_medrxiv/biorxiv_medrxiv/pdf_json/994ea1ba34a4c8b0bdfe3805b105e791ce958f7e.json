Such measures have been applied during prior pandemics, with moderate success (2) (3) (4) , and are predicted to prevent a rapid, overwhelming epidemic in modeling studies (5) . However, the extent to which social distancing measures have influenced the course of the COVID-19 pandemic has not been established. Because of the economic and social costs associated with social distancing measures (7, 8), there is immense value in quantifying the extent to which they have benefits for epidemic control. We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis to compare the daily growth rate of COVID-19 cases before versus after implementation of social distancing measures in the United States.",

Moreover, statewide restrictions on internal movement were often implemented after other social distancing measures had already been applied, further biasing our estimate toward the null. Our study was also limited by little observation time after statewide restrictions on internal movement were implemented.
