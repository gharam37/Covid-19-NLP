The coronavirus spike (S) protein, which facilitates viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion is heavily glycosylated and plays a critical role in the elicitation of the host immune response. The spike protein is comprised of two protein subunits (S1 and S2), which together possess 22 potential N-glycosylation sites. Herein, we report the glycosylation mapping on spike protein subunits S1 and S2 expressed on human cells through high resolution mass spectrometry. We have characterized the quantitative N-glycosylation profile on spike protein and interestingly, observed unexpected O-glycosylation modifications on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein subunit S1. Even though O-glycosylation has been predicted on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, this is the first report of experimental data for both the site of O-glycosylation and identity of the O-glycans attached on the subunit S1. Our data on the N-and O-glycosylation is strengthened by extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide spectra in addition to using bioinformatics tools to confirm the complexity of glycosylation in the spike protein. The elucidation of the glycan repertoire on the spike protein provides insights into the viral binding studies and more importantly, propels research towards the development of a suitable vaccine candidate. author/funder.

The spike protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein and consists of two subunits, namely S1 and S2. The S1 subunit facilitates the attachment of the virus, and subsequently the S2 subunit allows for the fusion of the viral and human cellular membranes (Hoffmann, M., Kleine-Weber, H., et al. 2020 , Walls, A.C., Park, Y.J., et al. 2020 , Zhou, P., Yang, X.L., et al. 2020 . The entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), and recent studies determined a high binding affinity to hACE2 (Hoffmann, M., Kleine-Weber, H., et al. 2020 , Shang, J., Ye, G., et al. 2020 , Walls, A.C., Park, Y.J., et al. 2020 . Given its literal key role, the S protein is one of the major targets for the development of specific medical treatments or vaccines: neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 could prevent the virus from binding to the hACE2 entry receptor and therefore from entering the host cell (Shang, J., Ye, G., et al. 2020 ).",

The N-glycans on S protein play important roles in proper protein folding and priming by host proteases. Since glycans can shield the amino acid residues and other epitopes from cells and antibody recognition, glycosylation can enable the coronavirus to evade both the innate and adaptive immune responses (Walls, A.C., Park, Y.J., et al. 2020 , Walls, A.C., Xiong, X., et al. 2019 . Elucidating the glycosylation of the viral S protein can aid in understanding viral binding with receptors, fusion, entry, replication and also in designing suitable antigens for vaccine development (Chakraborti, S., Prabakaran, P., et al. 2005 , Watanabe, Y., Bowden, T.A., et al. 2019 , Zheng, J., Yamada, Y., et al. 2018 .

The expression of SARS-Cov-2 spike protein subunits S1 and S2 on HEK 293 culture supernatant showed higher molecular weight upon SDS-PAGE than expected, because of glycosylation. Thus, the gel bands corresponding to the molecular weight of 200 kDa to 100 kDa for S1 and 150 kDa to 80 kDa for S2 were cut, proteins were lysed after reduction-alkylation and analyzed by LC-MS/MS (created with biorender.com).

We observed very strong evidence for the presence of Oglycosylation at site Thr323 as b and y ions of the peptide 320 VQPTESIVR 328 with high mass accuracy. Upon manual validation of the fragment ions of O-glycopeptide 320 VQPTESIVR 328 we observed that Thr323 is the predominantly occupied site. This conclusion was based on the b (b1m/z 228.13) and y (y1-m/z 175.12, y2-m/z 274.19, y4-474.30, y5-603.34 m/z, and y7+glycan-1748.77 m/z) ions we detected upon fragmentation of the glycopeptide(Figure 6a). In addition, neutral losses and the detection of oxonium ions also confirmed the presence of glycosylation on these peptides. Core-1 mucin type O-glycans such as GalNAc, GlcNAcGalNeuAc) were observed on site Thr323 (Figure 6). Possibly, Ser325 is occupied with HexNAcHexNeuAc glycan together with T323 (Figure 5), but this could not be confirmed unambiguously as Electron Transfer Dissociation (ETD) fragmentation on this peptide was not successful because of lower charge states of peptide (SuppFig S3, S4)(Shajahan, A., Heiss, C., et al. 2017).",

We evaluated the Oglycosylation site prediction using the widely accepted tool Net-O-Gly server 4.0(Steentoft, C.,   Vakhrushev, S.Y., et al. 2013). However, the tool did not find any strong prediction for the Oglycosylation except for the sites Ser673, Thr678 and Ser686.Our analysis confirmed the presence of O-glycosylation at Thr323 and indicated possible glycosylation at Ser325(Figure 5, 6). Intriguingly, the possible O-glycosylation at Thr323 of SARS-CoV-2 subunit 1 glycoprotein has been predicted by computational analysis in a very recent preprint report(Uslupehlivan, M. and Sener, E. 2020). The accuracy of our observation of O-glycosylation at Thr323 is further confirmed by the presence of proline at location 322, considering the well-established fact that the frequency of occurrence of proline residues is higher adjacent to O-glycosylation sites (ThankaChristlet, T.H. and Veluraja, K. 2001).

Our observation will pave the way for future studies to understand the implication of O-glycosylation at the RBD of S1 protein in viral attachment with hACE2 receptors.Our comprehensive N-and O-glycosylation characterization of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in a human cell system provides insights into site-specific N-and O-glycan decoration on the trimeric spike protein. We have employed an extensive manual interpretation strategy for the assignment of each glycopeptide structure in order to eliminate possibilities of ambiguous software based annotation. We are currently working on elucidating other potential post-translational modifications on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as understanding the protein modifications in detail is important to guide future researches on disease interventions involving spike protein. Detailed glycan analysis is important for the development of glycoprotein-based vaccine candidates as a means to correlate the structural variation with immunogenicity. Glycosylation can serve as a measure to evaluate antigen quality as various expression systems and production processes are employed in vaccine manufacture. The understanding of complex sialylated N-glycans and sialylated mucin type O-glycans, particularly in the RBD domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, provides basic knowledge useful for elucidating the viral infection pathology in future author/funder.
