            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, creates an urgent need for identifying molecular mechanisms that mediate viral entry, propagation, and tissue pathology. Cell membrane bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and associated proteases, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and Cathepsin L (CTSL), were previously identified as mediators of SARS-CoV2 cellular entry. Here, we assess the cell type-specific RNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL through an integrated analysis of 107 single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq studies, including 22 lung and airways datasets (16 unpublished), and 85 datasets from other diverse organs. Joint expression of ACE2 and the accessory proteases identifies specific subsets of respiratory epithelial cells as putative targets of viral infection in the nasal passages, airways, and alveoli. Cells that co-express ACE2 and proteases are also identified in cells from other organs, some of which have been associated with COVID-19 transmission or pathology, including gut enterocytes, corneal epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, heart pericytes, olfactory sustentacular cells, and renal epithelial cells. Performing the first meta-analyses of scRNA-seq studies, we analyzed 1,176,683 cells from 282 nasal, airway, and lung parenchyma samples from 164 donors spanning fetal, childhood, adult, and elderly age groups, associate increased levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL in specific cell types with increasing age, male gender, and smoking, all of which are epidemiologically linked to COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes. Notably, there was a particularly low expression of ACE2 in the few young pediatric samples in the analysis. Further analysis reveals a gene expression program shared by ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells in nasal, lung and gut tissues, including genes that may mediate viral entry, subtend key immune functions, and mediate epithelial-macrophage cross-talk. Amongst these are IL6, its receptor and co-receptor, IL1R, TNF response pathways, and complement genes. Cell type specificity in the lung and airways and smoking effects were conserved in mice. Our analyses suggest that differences in the cell type-specific expression of mediators of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry may be responsible for aspects of COVID-19 epidemiology and clinical course, and point to putative molecular pathways involved in disease susceptibility and pathogenesis.",

Following receptor binding, the virus gains access to the host cell cytosol through acid-dependent proteolytic cleavage of the S protein. For SARS-CoV, a number of proteases including TMPRSS2 and CTSL cleave at the S1 and S2 boundary and S2 domain (S2') 43 to mediate membrane fusion and virus infectivity.

In healthy lungs, both large and small airways contain mucous cells in surface airway epithelium, albeit at low numbers. However, submucosal glands (SMGs) that reside deep within the airway tissues are composed of abundant mucous cells. To test whether these mucous cells also express ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL, we performed an integrated analysis on scRNA-seq datasets obtained from microdissected SMGs of the healthy donors. We observed overlapping expression and relatively high enrichment of AEC2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL in mucous cells of the SMGS (Extended Data Fig. 5e ). In situ transcript analysis for ACE2 further confirmed the presence of transcripts in acinar epithelial cells of the SMGs (Fig. 1h) , and cells expressing ACE2 in the large airway epithelium (Fig. 1i) .",

We integrated samples across many studies, as no single dataset generated to date is sufficiently large to address this question. We assembled 22 datasets (Supplementary Table 2 , Supplementary Data File D3), comprised of 1,176,683 cells from 164 individuals, spanning 282 healthy nasal, lung, and airway samples profiled by scRNA-seq or snRNA-seq from either biopsies, resections, entire lungs that could not be used for transplant, or post mortem examinations, allowing us to study a diversity of respiratory regions and cell types (Fig. 3a) . These included 6 published datasets 63-68 and 16 datasets that are not yet published [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] . In the case of unpublished data, we only obtained singlecell expression counts for the three genes, as well as the total UMI counts per cell, cell identity annotations, and the relevant anonymous clinical variables (age and sex, as well as smoking status when ascertained). Cell identity annotations were manually harmonized using an ontology with three levels of annotation specificity (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Table 2 ); focusing on levels 2 and 3 allowed us to include a large number of datasets, while retaining relatively high cell subset specificity (Fig. 3a,b) . To facilitate rapid data sharing, we analyzed data pre-processed by each data-generating team at the level of gene counts, using total counts as a size factor. We used Poisson regression (diffxpy package; Methods) to model the association between the expression counts of the three genes and age, sex, and smoking status, and their possible pair-wise interactions (Fig. 3c) , using total counts as an offset, and dataset as a technical covariate to capture sampling and processing differences. It should be noted that modeling interaction terms was crucial as their omission resulted in reversed effects for age and sex for particular cell types (Discussion). This model was fitted to non-fetal lung data (761,693 cells, 165 samples, 77 donors, 10 datasets) within each cell type to assess cell-type specific association of these covariates with the three genes. To further validate sex and age associations, we fit a simplified version of the model without smoking status covariates to the full non-fetal lung data (986,342 cells, 225 samples, 125 donors, 16 datasets).",

For simplicity, we modeled the overall variance with both contributions covered implicitly by treating each cell as an independent observation. As cells from the same donor cannot be typically regarded as independent observations, this can result in inflated p-values, especially when there are few donors for a particular cell type. To counteract this limitation, we employed three approaches: (1) We used a simple noise model (Poisson) to reduce the chance of overfitting donor variability to obtain spurious associations; (2) We confirmed significant associations from the single-cell model in a pseudo-bulk analysis to ensure effect directions are consistent when modeling only donor variation (Methods, Fig. 3d , Extended Data Fig. 6, 7, 8, Supplementary Data D1) ; and, (3) We investigated whether significant associations change direction when holding out any one dataset to ensure that the effect is not dominated by the inclusion of many cells from only one source (Methods, Fig. 3f, Supplementary Data D1) . We regarded an association that passes all of these validations as a robust trend, while associations that appear dominated by a single dataset (often because this dataset is a major contributor of a given cell type) were denoted as indications.",

Strikingly, we find robust trends of ACE2 expression with age, sex, and smoking status in these cell types (Fig. 3d , Extended Data Fig. 6 and MALTE4): ACE2 expression increases with age in basal and multiciliated cells. ACE2 expression is elevated in males in airway secretory cells and alveolar AT2 cells. Furthermore, we find strongly elevated levels of ACE2 in past or current smokers in multiciliated cells (log fold change (log FC): 1.52, Fig. 3d ). Significant associations of ACE2 expression indicate increased expression with age in AT2 (largest age effect: slope of log expression per year of 0.020) and secretory cells, and increased expression of ACE2 in males in multiciliated cells. Further indications associate past or current smoking with decreased ACE2 expression in AT2 cells, and increased ACE2 expression in basal cells. However, these last five indications are not robust trends and depend on the inclusion of a single dataset (Fig. 3f) , often because that dataset contributes a large number of cells of a particular type. Specifically, when we held out the largest declined donor transplant dataset (Supplementary Table 2 , \"Regev-Rajagopal\", most cells and most samples), a declined donor tracheal epithelium dataset (\"Seibold\", Supplementary Table 2 , most donors in the smoking analysis), or a further declined donor lung dataset (\"Kropski-Banovich\", Supplementary Table 2 ) respectively, the effect is no longer present (Methods, Fig. 3f , Supplemenatry Data D1).",

The first aimed to find features that characterize programs of dual positive cells that are shared by different cell types in one tissue (\"tissue programs\"). The second aimed to find features that are associated with dual positive cells compared to other cells of the same type, and may or may not be shared with other types (\"cell programs\") (Methods). To infer tissue programs, we trained a random forest classifier to discriminate between dual-positive and dual-negative cells (excluding ACE2 and TMPRSS2; 75:25 class balanced test-train split), generalizing across multiple cell types in one tissue, and ranked genes according to their importance scores in the classifier (Methods). To infer cell programs, we performed differential expression analysis between dual-positive and dualnegative cells within each cell subset. We note that ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells have more unique transcripts detected (Extended Data Fig. 10b) : this can reflect a technical confounder, biological features, or both. We conservatively controlled for these differences (by sampling dual positive and dual negative cells from matched gene complexity bins; Methods; Extended Data Fig. 10b , Extended Data Fig. 11) . Importantly, these methods do not assume that ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells form a distinct subset within each cell type. Rather, our goal is to leverage the variation among single cells within a single type to identify gene programs that are co-regulated with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 within each expressing cell subset.",

We first confirmed that the cell programs were not merely associated with the number of transcripts per cell (Extended Data Fig. 11c) . While some genes were shared between the tissue and cell programs (e.g., many virus-related genes, such as CEACAM5, CXCL17, SLPI, and HLA-DRA), the cell programs further captured unique biological functions and activities. For example, dual positive lung secretory cells differentially expressed genes involved in TNF signaling including RIPK3, a key regulator of inflammatory cell death via necroptosis, previously implicated in SARS-CoV pathogenesis 84 . Both lung dual positive secretory and multiciliated cells differentially expressed lysosomal genes (MFSD8, CTSS, CTNS, CTSH), potentially relevant for endolysosomal entry of coronaviruses 85 . Dual positive AT1 cell programs included genes involved in immunoproteasome (PSMB8, PSMB9, Fig. 4c) , class I and II antigen presentation (HLA-DMA, HLA-DRB5, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DRA, HLA-DPA1), and phagocytosis. Dual-positive nasal goblet cells differentially expressed several cytokines and chemokines, including granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (CSF3), which may impact hematopoiesis, the recruitment of neutrophils, and inflammatory pathology; CXCL1 and CXCL3, chemoattractants for neutrophils; interleukin-19 (IL19), which induces the production of IL-6 and TNF 86 ; and CCL20, which is upregulated by TNF 87 . The AT2 cell program included the surfactant proteins, SFTPA1 and SFTPA2; the IL-1 receptor (IL1R1), which may promote antiviral immune responses (below); and, multiple components of MHC-II (e.g., HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1), congruent with a role in antigen presentation.",

Consistent with this hypothesis, ACE2 expression in enterocytes was significantly lower in ulcerative colitis patients treated with anti-TNF compared to untreated patients (mean = 0.22 and 0.13 log2(transcripts per 10,000 (TP10K)+1) in treated vs. untreated; adjusted P < 1e-3). However, we could not control for many important features, including disease severity, which is strongly associated with anti-TNF treatment, raising the need for future work. Some of the genes are targets of known drugs 88 . For example, dualpositive lung secretory cells expressed, in addition to ACE2 (targeted by ACE inhibitors), other drug targets, including C3, HDAC9, IL23A, PIK3CA, RAMP1, and SLC7A11. Other program genes were shown to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins via affinity purification mass spectrometry 89 . Among those was GDF15, which was identified as a putative interaction partner for the SARS-CoV-2 protein Orf8 89 , is a central regulator of inflammation 90 , and was a member of the dual-positive cell programs of both lung basal cells and nasal multiciliated cells.",

Importantly, the lung tissue and gut enterocyte programs include the gene encoding the IL6 co-receptor (IL6ST), and the AT2 cell program includes IL6. IL6 signaling has been implicated in uncontrolled immune responses in the lungs of COVID19 patients, elevated serum IL6 levels are associated with the need for mechanical ventilation 92 , and anti-IL6R antibodies (tocilizumab) are being tested for clinical efficacy in COVID-19 patients. Indeed, IL6ST and IL6 are higher in dual positive vs. dual negative AT2 cells (Extended Data Fig. 11d) , although IL6 expression is relatively low in these cells from healthy tissue.

To explore this possibility, we predicted interactions between AT2 cells (in general, or ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + dual-positives) and myeloid cells (Methods 96 ), using our large declined donor transplant dataset (\"Regev/Rajagopal\"; 41 samples, 10 patients, 2-6 locations each). AT2 cells and myeloid cells were present in lung lobes samples from all 10 patients, whereas samples from 5 patients contained both ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + dual-positive AT2 cells and myeloid cells. We identified significant predicted interactions involving Oncostatin M (OSM), an IL6-type cytokine expressed by myeloid cells 97 , with the Oncostatin M Receptor (OSMR) and its paralog receptor LIF Receptor Subunit Alpha (LIFR) expressed in both for AT2 cells in general, and in double positive ones). Interactions involving the complement pathway were also predicted (for all AT2 and dual positives) between Complement C3 and C5 expressed by AT2 cells and their cognate receptor expressed in myeloid cells. Three samples had interactions between the IL1 receptor on AT2 cells and IL1B or IL1RN in myeloid cells. The IL1-receptor interactions were identified mostly (in 2 out of 3 samples) involving only dual-positive AT2 cells, suggesting a possible role of ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + dual-positive cells in IL1-mediated processes. Finally, we identified interactions between CSF1, 2, or 3 expressed in AT2 cells (including double positives) and their receptors expressed in myeloid cells. These predicted interactions further support the previously identified roles for cross-talk between AT2 and myeloid cells, such as macrophages, in immune regulation (OSM, complement, IL1) and surfactant homeostasis (CSF), as previously highlighted 95 .",

While such analyses cannot address molecular compatibility (due to sequence variation in ACE2 across species, as shown for lower compatibility of SARS-CoV and mouse ACE2 98 ), they can help determine if dual-positive cells are present in commonly employed models, and if their characteristics, proportions, and programs are similar to those of their human counterparts. In a separate study 46 , our lung network showed strong similarities to the human data in a macaque model. Here, we focused on the more distant, but commonly used, mouse model. Ace2 + Tmprss2 + and Ace2 + Ctsl + dual-positive cells were present primarily in club and multiciliated cells in the airway epithelia of healthy mice 99 (Ace2 + Tmprss2 + club 5.1% [4.7%, 5.4%] and multiciliated 2.8% [2.3%, 3.5%], Ace2 + Ctsl + club 11.1% [10.6%, 11.6%] and multiciliated 3.5% [2.9%, 4.3%]), consistent with the expression patterns found in human airways (Fig. 5a) . Furthermore, Ace2 expression increased over a 2-month time-course of healthy mouse aging in both club (p=1.16e-06) and goblet (p=0.01911) cells (Fig. 5a) . The proportion of Ace2 + Tmprss2 + dual-positive cells did not significantly increase with age during this time course (data not shown), but the proportion of Ace2 + Ctsl + dual-positive cells significantly increased in club cells during this time-course (Fig. 5b) . Interestingly, the mice were aged between 2-4 months, a 2-month period that is reported to reflect the maturation period from early to mature adults 100 . Examining bulk RNA-Seq profiles of sorted populations of alveolar AT2 cells (SFTPC + ), airway basal cells (KRT5 + ), alveolar endothelial cells (CD45-CD31 + ), alveolar epithelial cells (Epcam + ), whole lung and whole trachea from a KRT5-CreER/LSL-TdTomato/SFTPC-eGFP transgenic mouse model, and across tissues from ENCODE, showed that Ace2, Tmprss2 and Ctsl are expressed in sorted AT2 cells, whole trachea and whole lung, as well as in stomach, intestine, kidney and bladder.",

Proprotein convertases have known roles in coronavirus S-protein priming 43, 103, 104 . We obtained similar results in an independent dataset of 182,952 cells from 40 donors (Extended Data Fig. 14a ,b, \"aggregated lung\").",

We further used the scale of these integrated atlases to identify gene programs in major epithelial cell subsets that may be infected by the virus, and search for other potential accessory proteases.

Neuroinflammation could result from direct viral infection of the brain, or a systemic cytokine storm 121-123,124-126,121-123 . Direct viral invasion of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is observed in multiple brain regions in human patients and mouse models 124, 125 , consistent with widespread ACE2 expression in numerous brain cell types. Furthermore, SARS-CoV has been shown to infiltrate the brain via the olfactory epithelium-olfactory bulb axis 127 ; olfactory transmission for SARS-CoV-2 has been recently proposed 128 . Other possible transmission routes could be through the infection of ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + enteric neurons synapsing with vagal afferents, or entry through blood-CNS interfaces such as the choroid plexus or meninges 121,129-131 . Profiling immune cells at these sites after infection is an important future step to better understand how the viral response may lead to encephalitis. One intriguing possibility is that encephalitis might arise as an autoimmune response to myelin antigens expressed by infected cells. Antibodies against peptides of myelin proteins have been clinically shown to be associated with autoimmune encephalitis and seizures [132] [133] [134] , and myelin peptides are targets of T cells 135 in demyelinating inflammatory neurological diseases such as acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, and multiple sclerosis [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] [142] . Oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cells of the CNS, are the main ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cell type in the brain, the myelin transcriptional regulator MYRF was enriched in certain ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cell types as noted above, and myelin proteins MOG and MBP were coexpressed in numerous ACE2+ clusters across organs. MYRF and MBP were significantly differentially expressed in ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + subsets of the lung and gut (Supplementary Table  10 ); myelin targeting Th17 cells trained in the gut are able to infiltrate the CNS in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis 143 . Taken together, the expression of myelin proteins across multiple ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells may hypothetically contribute to antigen presentation and autoimmune response in the context of viral infection. A small number of COVID-19 patients were reported to have Guillain-Barre Syndrome 144 , with a demyelinating process in some; this is consistent with observations of Guillain-Barre Syndrome following other viral infections such as Zika, influenza, and Epstein-Barr virus 139, 145, 146 . Whether anti myelin specific immunity can be induced by virus infected cells expressing myelin proteins remains an area for future study.",

We found that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and associated proteases were up-regulated in airway epithelial and AT2 cells with age and in males, an association that may shed light on the marked increase in mortality with age. Furthermore, ACE2 was up-regulated in airway epithelial cells (basal and multiciliated cells) in past or present smokers, but down-regulated in their AT2 cells; we have also confirmed this in an experimental system in a mouse model.

Importantly, ACE2 is particularly lowly expressed in young pediatric samples, also mirrored by lack of chromatin accessibility in the ACE2 locus. ACE2 expression is known to be regulated in complex ways across different tissues and may be affected by both common therapies (ACEi/ARB) (Tucker et al., companion manuscript 58 ), and during infection 46 . Moreover, both higher ACE2 expression per cell and a higher fraction of ACE2 + cells can in principle have implications for infection, but may have conflicting effects on pathogenesis, as ACE2 knockout mice show more severe ARDS upon lung injury because of its role in the renin-angiotensin pathway, which seems to protect from consequences of lung injury and inflammation 148 (for potential roles of this pathway on CoV infection (pre-COVID) see the review in 149 ). As SARS-CoV2 binding will lead to internalization and therefore downregulation of ACE2 on the cell surface, the protective function of ACE2 via its proteolytic processing of Angiotensin-II may be lost. Thus, the smoking mediated downregulation of ACE2 in AT2 cells may not protect cells from being infected but rather may increase ARDS due to more severe loss of ACE2 from the cell surface upon infection. Other confounders, including ACEi which are not available to our meta-analysis may further impact our results.",

To perform this meta-analysis, we used a model that included both the tested covariates (age, sex, and smoking status), technical covariates (dataset and the number of UMIs per cell), and several interaction terms. Including these interaction terms was crucial, as omission resulted in increased background variation and reversed effect estimates. Likewise, modeling the smoking status of a donor was important to reduce background variation and account for the unbalanced distribution of covariates in the dataset. For example, while we have similar numbers of male ascertained smokers and non-smokers (21 and 20 donors), there are three times as many female ascertained non-smokers as female smokers (27 and 9 donors), which is reflective of this bias in the population 150 . The addition of these terms increases the complexity of the model. Indeed, only one dataset (\"Seibold\") had sufficient numbers of donors of various ages, sex, and smoking status to fit the full model. Thus, performing the meta-analysis was only possible due to the aggregation of a large number of healthy single-cell datasets enabled by the HCA Lung Biological Network and a community-wide effort.",

Thus, the significance of association with traits such as sex, age, and smoking status may show inflated p-values, especially where the associations are determined from few donors. In this case, the variation between cells from a single donor dominates the variation between donors, background variation is underestimated and effect significance can be overestimated. Aggregating many datasets allows us to counteract this effect, yet p-value inflation may occur in cell types that are not as commonly shared across datasets. Our main conclusions are drawn on airway epithelial and AT2 cells, which are distributed widely across datasets and are modeled on the basis of many donors. Furthermore, we have confirmed significant associations by pseudo-bulk analysis and by holding out datasets. This confirmation ensures that associations are consistent when only considering donor variation, and we are aware if these associations are dataset dependent (often when one dataset is a particularly major source of a given cell type). Models that account for both single-cell count distributions, and population structure in the data have the potential to improve future meta-analyses across single-cell atlases.",

In the lung, epithelial cells express IL6, IL6R and IL6ST, which raises the hypothesis that infection may trigger cytokine expression from these cells and contribute to uncontrolled immunological responses. The immune-like programs in these cells are further reinforced by the accessibility of STAT and IRF binding sites in scATAC-Seq data, consistent with another study from our network showing the role of interferon in regulating ACE2 expression in epithelial cells 46 . Notably, scRNA-Seq analysis of immune cells from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of COVID-19 patients identified high activity of transcription factors such as STAT1/2 and IRF1/2/5/7/8/9 in macrophage states increased in severe COVID-19 patients 151 . Other hypotheses for future studies include lysosomal genes in dual positive lung secretory and multiciliated cells, which may be consistent with putative \"viral entry\" cells, and RIPK3 expression in the cell programs of airway cells, which opens the hypothesis of necroptosis initiating a pro-inflammatory response. Interestingly, we observed relatively high enrichment of ACE2 in secretory cell types (mucous cells and AT2 cells). We speculate that viruses may take advantage of the rich secretory pathway components in these cells for their efficient dispersal. Additionally, SMGs of the airways are recently shown to serve as reservoirs of reserve stem cells 152, 153 . Therefore, we also speculate that SMGs similarly may serve as reservoirs for viruses where they can escape from muco-ciliary transport and mechanical expulsion associated with severe cough in the airway luminal surface.",

            "text": "Finally, to explore therapeutic hypotheses related to disruption of viral processing via protease inhibition, we explored the expression of other proteases across our integrated atlases. Although a multitude of different SARS-CoV-2 features likely account for its high pathogenicity and transmissivity, it has been speculated that the PRRAR loop might contribute to increased COVID-19 severity. Introduction of similar polybasic cleavage sites into avian influenza viruses and human coronaviruses was shown to render them more pathogenic, increasing mortality and viral spread 158, 159 . One hypothesis is that acquisition of a PCSK cleavage site would expand the number of cell types that can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2. A recent report has started to address expression of FURIN in cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 host factors ACE2 or TMPRSS2 47 , and FURIN activity is inhibited by Guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs), a group of interferonstimulated genes, in order to restrict viral envelope processing 160 . However, the highly overlapping recognition sequence of PCSK family members (Extended Data Fig. 14d) suggests that multiple PCSKs in addition to FURIN could mediate cleavage at the S1/S2 PRRAR motif (Extended Data  Fig. 14e) . Our expression analysis confirms that PCSK family members, in particular FURIN, PCSK5 and PCSK7, are more broadly expressed than TMPRSS2 across lung cell types (Fig. 6d) , as well as across tissues (Extended Data Fig. 14i) . In the lung, we note the higher proportion of ACE2 + PCSK7 + basal cells and ACE2 + PCSK7/5 + fibroblasts (Fig. 6e, Extended Data Fig. 14h) . Interestingly, the host interactome of SARS-CoV-2 further suggests interaction of viral proteins with PCSK6 89 , which also showed significant ACE2 co-expression in AT2 cells (Fig. 6b,  Extended Data Fig. 14b) . Moreover, because PCSK localization is detected in different membrane compartments along the secretory and endocytic pathways 107 , it is conceivable that PCSKs could process SARS-CoV-2 S-proteins at different stages of the viral life cycle. Moreover, further analysis is required to assess the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 relies on proteolytic activity provided in trans either by neighboring cells or extracellularly localized proteases 111 . Altogether, this could provide SARS-CoV-2 with an immense flexibility in different entry and egress pathways.",

We included the dataset term to model the batch effects between the diverse datasets we obtained, and the log total counts per cell was used as an offset. Here, the total counts were scaled to have a mean of 1 across all cells before the log was taken.

Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the R package EnrichR (version 1.0) 181 , selecting the top 25 genes from each cell type for the pan-tissue analysis (\"All\" category; Fig. 4e ), and the top 50 genes from each cell type for the tissue-specific analyses (\"Gut\", \"Nasal\", and \"Lung\" categories; Fig. 4e ). We note a few caveats/challenges/limitations that may influence our results, including non uniform sampling across donors; variation in cell compositions across regions (e.g., distal lung vs carina), and additional cellular heterogeneity that the current level of broad subset annotation may not have been captured.",
