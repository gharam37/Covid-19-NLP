For mouse cochlear cultures, reduction in hair cell counts were most dramatic in 231 basal regions and in outer hair cells, consistent with differences in the sensitivity of hair 232 cells to other ototoxins and reported hearing loss being limited to or most profound at high 233 frequencies with most other ototoxins (Bielefeld et al., 2018; Chowdhury et al., 2018; 234 Kotecha and Richardson, 1994). While there are no in vivo mammalian studies to compare 235 with the results presented here, these results are consistent with the absence of hair cells 236 with fetal exposure to chloroquine (Matz & Naunton, 1968). 237 Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have good oral bioavailability and reach high 238 plasma levels in patients. Their pharmacokinetic profiles indicate extremely long elimination 239 half-lives on (weeks to months) and large volumes of distribution indicating significant 240 partitioning into tissues including cerebrospinal fluid (White 1985). Given these 241 pharmacokinetic characteristics, it is entirely possible that drug concentration in the inner 242 ear reach micromolar concentrations used in the experiments described here. 243 Because quinine users commonly reported similar side effects to that of patients 244 taking chloroquine, it can be posited that the effects of these structurally-related quinoline 245 drugs with the tissues of the inner ear are comparable. These results are consistent with 246 reports of audiological and vestibular dysfunction after quinine treatment for malaria 247 prophylaxis or treatment (Hennebert and Fern\u00e1ndez, 1959; Karlsson et al., 1990; Nielsen-248 Abbring et al., 1990; Phillips-Howard and ter Kuile, 1995; Roche et al., 1990).

Lysosomes have emerged as 259 organelles with critical signaling roles regulating many aspects of cellular function (reviewed 260 by Xu and Ren, 2015). They also play central roles in autophagy, the process by which 261 cellular components are recycled (reviewed in Parzych and Klionsky, 2014). Chloroquine's 262 effects on lysosomes are likely to have effects on diverse downstream cellular processes 263 including receptor signaling, with anti-inflammatory consequences (Wallace et al., 2012), 264 and autophagy, with anti-tumor effects (Levy et al., 2017). There may therefore be multiple 265 effects of chloroquine on hair cell function with consequences to their survival. 266 While both zebrafish and mouse cochlear hair cells are sensitive to chloroquine, 267 there are differences in the nature of the dose-response functions. Loss of zebrafish hair 268 cells approached an asymptote of about 40% reduction without further loss at higher 269 concentrations of chloroquine, while basal outer hair cells in mouse cochlear cultures 270 approach 100% loss with increasing dose. The underlying causes of asymptotic nature of 271 the zebrafish dose-response function is unknown. We hypothesized that chloroquine may 272 reduce its uptake and toxicity at higher concentrations by blocking hair cell 273 mechanotransduction, a property required for the hair cell entry of some other compounds 274 in zebrafish, including aminoglycosides and cisplatin (Thomas et al., 2012; Hailey et al. 275 2017). Although other quinoline loop derivatives have been shown to interfere with 276 mechanotransduction (Farris et al., 2004; Ou et al., 2012), we found little effect of 277 chloroquine on mechanotransduction-dependent FM1-43 dye uptake in zebrafish. 278",
