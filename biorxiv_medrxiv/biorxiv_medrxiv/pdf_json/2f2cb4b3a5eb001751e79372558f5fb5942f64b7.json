These infections are typically nonpathogenic in bats raising questions about innate immune differences that might exist between bats and other mammals. Tetherin is an important restriction factor which inhibits the release of a diverse range of viruses from host cells, including retroviruses, coronaviruses, filoviruses, and paramyxoviruses, some of which are deadly to humans and transmitted by bats. Here we characterise the tetherin genes from 27 species of bats, revealing that they are under strong selective pressure, and that fruit bats and vesper bats express unique structural variants of the tetherin protein. The expression of two computationally predicted splice isoforms of fruit bat tetherin is verified here, and we identify an additional third unique splice isoform which includes a C-terminal region that is not homologous to known mammalian tetherin variants. We also report that vesper bats possess and express at least five tetherin genes, including structural variants, a greater number than any other mammal reported to date.",

Viruses such as Hendra, Nipah, Ebola, Marburg, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1 and likely also SARS-CoV-2), and the Sosuga virus have crossed species barriers from bats into humans (1) (2) (3) (4) . Laboratory studies demonstrate that specific bat species can be infected with Ebola, Marburg, SARS-CoV-1, Hendra, and Nipah viruses without showing clinical symptoms (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Recently, this has led to efforts to elucidate if there are differences observed between the antiviral strategies of bats and other mammals (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . These studies have identified that genes related to immunity in bats are under a significant degree of positive selection, in addition to differences in the copy number and diversity of innate immune genes of bats relative to other mammals (11) (12) (13) (14) 16) .",

Tetherin contains a number of conserved cytosine and asparagine motifs within the extracellular domain, with respective roles in dimerisation and glycosylation, and a dual-tyrosine motif Introduction (Y\u00b7x\u00b7Y) in its cytoplasmic region, which has a role in viral particle endocytosis and immune signaling cascades (25, 34) . Tetherin is located in lipid rafts at the plasma membrane where many viral particles bud during acquisition of their host membrane-derived viral envelopes (33) . During the viral budding process one anchor remains embedded in the nascent viral envelope while the other remains attached to the plasma membrane, tethering the virion to the cell and preventing its release into the extracellular environment (22, 32) .",

We identified 30 contigs matching the query (lowest E-value = 9.21 x 10 -23 ). A single P. alecto homolog of tetherin, herein described as isoform A, homologous to human l-tetherin and the predicted X1 isoform (GenBank: XM_006904279), was identified. P. alecto Tetherin isoform A has a low level of primary amino acid sequence conservation (37%) compared Results 8 to human l-tetherin ( Figure 2A ) and other mammalian (28 -47%) tetherin sequences homologous to human l-tetherin ( Figure 2B ). Despite the low amino acid sequence identity, the predicted secondary structures and protein domains are largely conserved between bats and other mammals ( Figure 2B ), with all tetherin proteins containing the cytoplasmic (CD), transmembrane (TM), extracellular domains (ED), and the posttranslationally cleaved GPI-anchor signal peptide (GSP). An exception to this is the tetherin B of sheep, which does not contain the GSP domain.",

P. alecto tetherin isoforms A and B were detected primarily as broad bands at the expected positions ~56-75 kDa while isoform C was present as both dimers and monomers (~32-35 kDa) ( Figure 7A ). The presence of broad/multiple bands in close proximity to each other likely reflects variable levels of tetherin glycosylation as previously reported for human tetherin (22) . M. macropus tetherin A was also detected as a dimer at the expected size of ~55 kDa while tetherin B was only detected as a monomer with a size of ~26 kDa ( Figure 7B ). These data show that all tetherin constructs are capable of expressing tagged tetherin proteins and that these proteins differ in their capacity to form the expected dimerised form of tetherin. Bat tetherin proteins that are homologous to human l-tetherin dimerise as expected, while the structurally unique tetherin proteins behave differently.

This is in agreement with previous reports that primate tetherin possess multiple sites under positive selection in this same region (47) . The driver of positive selection in the case of primate tetherin is antagonism by viral counter-measures including HIV-1 Vpu (47). Venkatesh et al. (48) demonstrated that the configuration that tetherin dimers adopt during viral particle retention primarily consists of the GPI-anchor being embedded in the viral envelope and the transmembrane domain remaining attached to the cellular membrane. If this paradigm holds true for bat tetherin, then it follows that the tetherincell membrane interface is the major site of tetherin antagonism in bats and it would be reasonable to speculate that the drivers of this selection are viral antagonists analogous in the mode of interaction, if not structure or function, to lentiviral tetherin antagonists.",

This observation is notable because the capacity of tetherin to form cysteine-linked dimers is required for the restriction of HIV-1 viral particles (46) which we chose as the VLPs against which bat tetherin proteins were functionally validated for inhibiting viral particle release. In contrast to restriction of HIV-1, Sakuma et al. (49) have reported that tetherin dimerisation is not required for the restriction of arenaviruses and filoviruses, suggesting that the need for dimerisation is virus/VLP-dependent.",

This was shown by non-reducing SDS-PAGE size separation and subsequent Western blot analysis in which a detectable signal was observed almost exclusively at the expected size of tetherin dimers (Figure 7 ). In contrast, P. alecto tetherin isoform C was present in similar amounts in both the dimeric and monomeric forms ( Figure 7A ). This observation is surprising because P. alecto tetherin isoform C contains all of the conserved cysteine residues and the same extracellular coiled-coil domain as isoforms A and B. The distinct C-terminal region in isoform C is the result of an alternative splicing event that also causes the loss of the final three amino acid residues of the coiledcoil region possessed by isoforms A and B. Additionally, the inserted HA tag is located in the position immediately following then coiled-coil domain. It is possible that the absence of the three terminal amino acid residues in the coiled-coil domain of isoform C relative to isoform A and B accounts for the difference in relative extents of dimerisation.",

Tetherin function was validated through an assessment of the capacity of P. alecto tetherin isoforms A, B, and C, and M. macropus tetherins A and B to restrict the release of HIV\u0394Vpu VLPs. P. alecto tetherin isoforms A and B were capable of restricting the release of HIV\u0394Vpu VLPs, in contrast to isoform C which lacked restriction activity ( Figure 9A ). M. macropus tetherin A restricted HIV\u0394Vpu VLP release, while tetherin B did not ( Figure 9B ).

A. The consensus bat tetherin amino acid sequence generated through the multiple sequence alignment of tetherin from 27 bat species (SI Data 1) and compared against human tetherin. Strong positive selection of bat tetherin is revealed by the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations (Table 2) , and is represented as evolutionary hotspots. The YxY dual tyrosine motif, the alternative start site for the short isoform of tetherin, and the GPI anchor attachment site positions are indicated by arrows. The red asterisk (*) indicates the location of the inserted molecular tags in the P. alecto and M. macropus tetherin expression constructs. CD, cytoplasmic domain; TM, transmembrane domain; ED, extracellular domain; GPI, glycophosphatidylinositol; GSP, GPI signal peptide. B. Significant sequence diversity exists among bat tetherin proteins, indicated by the percentage of amino acid sequence conservation at each site of the consensus bat tetherin. Amino acids conserved in all 27 sequences are represented by their letters. Amino acids represented by X are variable and are included to indicate the sequence distance between closely positioned conserved residues. C. The consensus bat tetherin sequence. Amino acid residues represented in > 50% of bat tetherin sequences are indicated with their letter. Positions at which no amino acid residue is represented in > 50% of bat tetherin sequences are indicated with 'X'. The red line indicates the position of the dual tyrosine motif.

The M. ricketti tetherin A and B share 100% amino acid sequence identity with their M. macropus counterparts. The tetherin of M. schreibersii shares between 34.6 and 49.7% sequence identity across all pairs. An additional splice variant (isoform B) of M. macropus tetherin C was also identified. M. macropus tetherin C isoform B is predicted to have a C-terminal truncation and possesses only the cytoplasmic domain, transmembrane domain, and less than half of the",

While there is no available genome for M. macropus, the most closely related publically accessible genome assemblies are for the relatively distantly related M. lucifugus and M. davidii, which diverged from M. macropus approximately 19 and 14 mya, respectively (38). For comparison, humans and chimpanzees diverged approximately 6.5 mya (39). A BLASTn analysis of the M. macropus tetherin nucleotide sequences against the M. davidii and M. lucifugus genomes revealed first that both species were too distantly related to M. macropus to match each M. macropus gene product specific to M. davidii or M. lucifugus gene regions.

Quantitation was performed by first normalising variation in VLP expression between the samples by determining the ratio of the signal strength of each cell lysate and supernatant sample to the signal strength of the corresponding sample not transfected with tetherin (the 0 ng tetherin sample).
