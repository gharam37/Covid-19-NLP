These underscored the imperative for strong and immediate measures to slow the spread of infection. In the coming weeks, however, as policymakers continue enlisting models to inform decisions on COVID-19, answers to the most difficult and pressing policy questions will be much more sensitive to underlying uncertainties. In this study, we demonstrate a model-based approach to assessing the potential value of reducing critical uncertainties most salient to COVID-19 decision-making and discuss priorities for acquiring new data to reduce these uncertainties. We demonstrate how information about the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions could narrow prediction intervals around hospitalizations over the next few weeks, while information about the prevalence of undetected cases could narrow prediction intervals around the timing and height of the peak of the epidemic.",

Despite substantial uncertainties surrounding the biology of the disease and intervention costs and effects, most models arrived at the same qualitative finding: left unchecked, the spread of COVID-19 would overwhelm hospital capacity to care for acute and critical cases, resulting in intolerable potential morbidity and mortality. These projections underscored the imperative for bold and immediate measures to slow the spread of infection. [6] [7] [8] Policymakers will continue enlisting models to forecast the trajectory of COVID-19 in the coming weeks. 6, 9, 10 As many communities have implemented shelter-in-place orders and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), vital questions now include how to plan for short-term and long-term health system needs and when and how policymakers might begin to modify or relax the imposition of NPIs. Answers to these questions will be much more sensitive to underlying uncertainties. They will require a different kind of modeling, focused less on conventional forecasting and more on program evaluation, resource allocation, careful characterization of uncertainty, and optimal inference from limited information.",

First, we calculated the uncertainty around this projected time when the model was only calibrated to the confirmed case counts through March 15.

If additional information pointed to a relatively low burden of undetected infection (i.e. higher case ascertainment at baseline) (Figure 2) , this information would signal a longer time to reach the peak of the epidemic and higher peak compared to an alternative in which new information pointed to lower baseline case ascertainment.

These values were derived from the age-stratified infection fatality ratios (IFR) calculated by Ferguson et al. (2020) (who in turn derived their estimates from work by Verity et al. (2020) , while also adjusting for a varying attack rate across age groups). Ferguson et al. (2020) provides an IFR for 10-year age bins (i.e., 0-9 years, 10-19 years, etc.). In order estimate the mortality risk for the three age groups used in this analysis, we calculated a weighted average of the IFR across the It is important to note, however, that the mortality risk values we assume here are somewhat different from other estimates of the mortality risk. Riou et al. (2020) , which adjusts crude fatality rates from Hubei province, China, to account for delayed mortality and unidentified cases, estimate that the case fatality risk is less than 0.05% among individuals 19 years of age and younger, between 0.19% and 2.7% for individuals between 20-59 years old, and is at least 9.5% for individuals older than 60. Because estimating the number of deaths is not a primary aim of this model, however, uncertainty in the mortality risk is unlikely to have a significant impact on the model results. The main effect of the uncertainty would be to slightly change the size of the recovered population, which would impact the rate of exposure for susceptible individuals, but likely not enough to affect the main conclusions of the analysis.",

Based on these results, we calibrate the proportion of asymptomatic infections for individuals 20 years and older across the range of 20% to 40%. This range is also supported by Nishiura et al.
