Thus far, no therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe COVID-19, and the mortality rate of severe COVID-19 patients is high [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Pathological results suggested that the lung displayed diffuse alveolar damage. In addition, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, mainly lymphocytes, were observed in both lungs [6] . Moreover, several studies have shown that CRP, D-dimer and serum proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, etc.) was increased in patients with severe COVID-19 [6] [7] [8] [9] . These findings suggested that the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) may be associated with COVID-19. CRS is a systemic inflammatory response that can be induced by infection and certain drugs. The sharp increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines is the main manifestation, which can cause damage to the heart, lungs and other organs [10] . Therefore, regulating systemic inflammatory response may be a key method for treating patients with COVID-19, and several clinical studies targeting CRS have been conducted [11] . Viral infection can also cause the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ROS plays an important role in virus replication and invasion [12] , organ damage [13, 14] , and systemic inflammatory response [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

ALA could significantly reduce levels of serum inflammatory cytokines and improve symptoms of some severe patients (such as acute coronary syndrome, etc.) [21] [22] [23] [24] . Some clinical trials have been designed to dampen inflammatory responses.

In another clinical trial focused on patients with severe COVID-19, there was no significant difference in viral RNA loads or duration of viral RNA detectability between the lopinavir-ritonavir combination treatment group and the control group, but lopinavir-ritonavir treatment group presented with lower all-cause mortality on day 28 (P>0.05) [30] . Thus, in addition to the anti-virus treatment strategy, searching for other treatment strategies are of clinical importance aiming to alleviate the complications of COVID patients and reduce the mortality rate of patients with severe and critically ill COVID-19 was also essential. This trial has several limitations. In particular, the trial did not have sufficient number of cases. Because the epidemic situation in Wuhan was rapidly under control during the trial period, and critically ill COVID patients participating other clinical trials could not be enrolled in this study, only 17 critically ill COVID patients were enrolled in this study. Another limitation is that we use all-cause mortality as our secondary outcome, which could not distinguish death due to primary SARS-COV-2 insult from secondary bacterial infection, which was common in late phrase of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Further clinical studies are needed to verify the promising efficacy of ALA injection in patients with critically ill COVID-19.",
