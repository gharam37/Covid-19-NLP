Most of the functional hubs proteins were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, 52% of the proteins related to cardiovascular disease, and they involved in viral infection, which causes vulnerability and severity in the risk individuals. We also showed five interconnecting cascades between hubs of both networks that explore the preparation of the optimal environment in the host for viral replication initiated at the phase of receptor attachment. Interestingly, we propose that seven potential miRNAs targeting the intermediate phase that connects receptor and viral replication process a better choice as a drug for SARS-CoV-2.",

The envelope (E), membrane (M), and spike (S) proteins localized at vial surface suggested having host binding capacity.

            "text": "Here, we looked for densely connected protein, which provides essential functional hubs within the network. Molecular complex detection (MCODE) algorithm (Bader et al., 2003) used to extract hubs that define the core regulatory signaling and cellular processes within the network. Eleven core functional hubs were obtained from the viral replication machinery network (Appendix Fig S1-11 ). In a receptor-mediated network, the implementation of the MCODE algorithm was exempted for its limited number of nodes and edges, which by itself forms hubs. Hence, the interacting proteins for all four distinct receptors were considered as hubs for the receptor-mediated network (Fig 2) . All hub proteins were mapped to differential expressed genes from RNA-Seq data. Of 374 hub proteins from both the network, 76 were differentially regulated in primary human lung epithelium (NHBE) on SARS-CoV2 infection (RNA-Seq dataset GSE147507). For instance, eight differentially expressed hub proteins were noticed in the receptor-mediated network (Table EV1) . Similarly, among 325 hub proteins of viral replication machinery network, 68 were altered significantly, which confirms the hijacking of endogenous human proteins for the viral replication process (Table EV1) .",

We converted all collected interacting human proteins to an official gene/protein symbol using the Uniport database (https://www.uniprot.org/). Further, the interacting proteins were categorized into SET-A and SET-B. The SET-A contains Human proteins that interact with SARS-CoV2 structural proteins, especially envelope (E), spike (S), and membrane (M) whereas SET-B contains Human proteins that interact with nucleocapsid (N) and 22 non-structural proteins. The SET-A was further curated to have proteins localized at plasma membrane using Cell surface protein atlas (https://wlab.ethz.ch/cspa/), Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) (https://www.hprd.org/), and Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/) database, assuming SARS-CoV2 structural proteins use these host surface proteins for attachment.",
