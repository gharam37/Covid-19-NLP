To follow the transmission dynamics, there is a big demand in early diagnosis with a race in developing and approving tests for early and accurate molecular diagnosis of the infection. Thus, there is an urgent need in early prediction in order to reduce the risk for transmission worldwide in all locations. The task governments and national authorities now are facing is to apply recommendations and decisions for rapid strengthening of outbreak surveillance and control efforts. It is very important to be able to estimate and predict the virus spread and be able to decode viral characteristics of the infection and spread pattern in many countries worldwide, taking into consideration all relevant aspects, in order to take robust decisions for political interventions and control measures. Mathematical models are used to forecast the course of the epidemic. In the light of the above, with reference to the mortality data in each country, the aim of the current study was to develop a novel robust and reliable global algorithm for estimating and predicting the COVID-19 pandemic outburst for up to 10 days after the prediction date in different locations worldwide.",

The Pearson's correlation coefficient R measures the variance that is interpreted by the model, which is the reduction of variance when using the model. R values ranges from 0 to 1 while the model has healthy predictive ability when it is near to 1 and is not analyzing whatever when it is near to 0.
