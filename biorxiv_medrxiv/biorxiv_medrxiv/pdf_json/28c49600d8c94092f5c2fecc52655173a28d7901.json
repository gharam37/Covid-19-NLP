This suggests that risk for COVID-19 within PSH has the potential to resemble vulnerabilities found in nursing homes, which have been described as \"ground zero\" for the current pandemic. This study reports on survey results collected from 532 PSH tenants in Los Angeles, California during the 4 th week of March in 2020. Results show that nearly all tenants were aware of COVID-19 and 65% considered it to be a very serious health threat, which was a strong predictor of taking protective measures (i.e. handwashing and social distancing). Tenants in units with shared bathroom facilities had lower odds of social distancing than those in studio apartments. Tenants with mental health diagnoses had lower odds of consistent handwashing. Lack of access to food, hygiene items, and medication delivery were common barriers to sheltering in place.",

Tenants were also asked whether they could shelter in place for 14 days if necessary, and those who answered \"no\" or \"maybe\" were asked what they would need in order to shelter in place: delivery of food, hygiene products, medications, someone to check in with, something to do, or other). How they viewed the health risk posed by COVID-19 was asked on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from \"not at all\" to \"very seriously.\" Engagement in preventive handwashing and social distancing was assessed on 4-point Likert scales ranging from \"no\" to \"yes, all the time.\" Matched administrative data provided basic demographic and health information about respondents (age, gender, race, ethnicity, and presence of a mental health condition).",
