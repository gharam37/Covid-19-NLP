Their estimate of the R 0 in Wuhan before any intervention is R 0 = 2.35, and one week after intervention began was R 0 = 1.05 (that is, 45% of 2.35). The estimate of 2.35 pre-intervention is also commensurate with the estimate of the group at Imperial College London, who arrived at a value of R 0 = 2.4 [3] . Further estimates in the literature are mentioned in Appendix A. We consider the intervention in Wuhan as \"strong\", and also consider a \"moderate\" intervention with scaling factor 0.6. These factors are also close to those considered in the Neher lab modelling, which considered mitigation factors of 0.4 and 0.6.",

While it would appear that the measures introduced in Sydney -physical distancing, and the closure of non-essential businesses -should have a \"strong\" effect on R 0 , this key question is beyond the scope of this study. What we can say from the results here is that mitigation strategies need to be strong enough to produce the desired effect on R 0 . \u2022 What is the baseline R 0 for Sydney? The Imperial College study used 2.4 as default [3] , and Kucharski et al. in Lancet estimated it at 2.35 [5] . These estimates have wide confidence intervals, and it could be lower in Sydney due to earlier awareness and also a more diffuse population. The Harvard group had a lower estimate of approx 1.9 but that assumed a quite high exposed-to-symptomatic probability of \u2265 0.5 [10] . This assumption has the effect in their models of lowering estimates of R 0 .",

An introduction to such models can be found in the text [1] .In this implementation of the SEIR-type model shown in Figure 1 , each compartment (sub-population) is further divided into age brackets, and these have different features based on what has been inferred about COVID-19 to date. Thus the model is really a set of models, one for each age bracket, denoted a (so that S a refers to the susceptible population in age-bracket a). Age brackets and age-specific parameters are shown in Table 3 .",
