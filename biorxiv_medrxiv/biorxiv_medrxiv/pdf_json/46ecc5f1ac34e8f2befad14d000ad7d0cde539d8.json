An analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in 30 survivors showed that 26 of those individuals had a CD8+ response to at least one EBOV protein. The dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire.",

A single vaccination in a C57BL/6 : bioRxiv preprint mouse using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine formulation containing NP44-52 is enough to confer immunity in mice. Our work suggests that a peptide vaccine based on CD8+ T-cell immunity in EBOV survivors is conceptually sound and feasible. Nucleocapsid proteins within SARS-CoV-2 contain multiple class I epitopes with predicted HLA restrictions consistent with broad population coverage. A similar approach to a CTL vaccine design may be possible for that virus.",

These include peptides from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) RGYVYQGL [68] , and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RGPGRAFVTI [5] . The existence of such epitopes makes a range of preclinical vaccine experiments possible without having to rely on non-human pri- 35 mates and expensive and complex-to-manage humanized mouse models. Wilson et al. showed that the EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) is an immunogen that provides protective, CTL-mediated immunity against EBOV in a C57BL/6 mouse model and that this protection was conferred by a peptide sequence within Ebola Zaire: NP43-53 (VYQVNNLEEIC) [73] . Wilson et al. came to this conclusion 40 based on studying splenocytes harvested from mice vaccinated with Ebola Zaire NP using a Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) vector.

By loading only one peptide 55 sequence per microsphere, we maximized the peptide payload and mitigated the possibility of multiple, different peptide sequences being delivered to the APC simultaneously, which could possibly result in competitive inhibition at the motif which could interfere with antigen presentation and subsequent T-cell expansion (Supplementary Material Section 1). 60 We also set out to see if a similar approach to a CTL vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2 would be feasible based on an analysis of the HLA binding characteristics of peptide sequences on SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid.",

We hypothesized that the NP43-53 epitope was inefficiently processed into MHC binding sub-sequences during antigen presentation. In order to explore possible H2-D b matches for peptide sequences 95 contained within Ebola Zaire NP43-53 (VYQVNNLEEIC), we prepared three peptide vaccine formulations, each containing one of the three possible 9mer sub-sequences within NP43-53. These sequences are shown in Table 1 . We then vaccinated, via intradermal (tail) injection, three groups of mice with microspheres containing one of the three 9mer sub-sequences of NP43-53 (6 per 100 group). ELISPOT analysis was performed, stimulating harvested splenocytes with the three possible 9mer sub-sequences. Splenocytes from mice receiving the NP44-52 sub-sequence had a statistically higher ELISPOT response than mice vaccinated with the other two possible sub-sequence 9mers (P < 0.0001) as shown in Figure 1a . This is consistent with the predicted H2-D b binding 9mer Sub-sequences of VYQVNNLEEIC . This peptide has a predicted favorable H2-I b binding affinity as shown in Supplementary Material Table 5 .",

Also, neutralizing antibodies directed against spike protein in SARS-CoV-1 patients have been associated with an increased risk of Acute Lung Injury (ALI) [35] . Specifically, patients succumbing to SARS-CoV-1 were found to develop a neutralizing antibody (NAb) response to spike protein faster than survivors after the onset of symptoms and the NAb titers 365 were higher in the patients who died compared with those who recovered [76] . To the extent to which antibody vaccines producing an antibody response against the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 could increase the risk of ALI, this risk could also be mitigated by a using peptide vaccine as an alternative approach.",

The adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine platform described here incorporates unmodified peptides making possible rapid manufacture and deployment to respond to a new viral threat. NP44-52 is located within one of the EBOV nucleocapsid proteins considered 245 essential for virus replication. This epitope resides in a sequence conserved across multiple EBOV strains as shown in Supplementary Material Figure 6. A 7.3 A structure for NP and VP24 is shown for context in Figure 6a [67]. A 1.8 A resolution structure rendering for EBOV NP shown in Figure 6b illustrates that NP44-52 is a buried structural loop, which is likely to be important to the 250 structural integrity of the EBOV NP protein [16]. This structural role of NP44-52 likely explains its conservation across EBOV strains. CTL targeting of the EBOV NP protein has been described [42][64][28] [49][24]. Nucleocapisid proteins are essential for EBOV replication [61]. Recent advances in T-cell based vaccines have focused on avoiding all variable 255 viral epitopes and incorporating only conserved regions [7][25]. EBOV NP may be more conserved than nucleocapsid proteins VP35 and VP24 making it more suitable as a CTL vaccine target [9][73]. The nucleocapsid proteins in SARS-CoV-1 are also essential for that virus to function normally [10]. This suggests that a CTL vaccine targeting coronavirus nucleocapsid could be effective against 260 SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2. We have shown that an H2-D b restricted Class I peptide exists within the NP41-60 epitope identified by Sakebe et al. as the most commonly favored NP epitope for CD8+ attack by survivors of the 2013-1016 EBOV outbreak in WestAfrica.

Sakebe et al. identified A*30:01:01 as the only HLA type common to all four survivors in their study with CD8+ targeting of NP41-60. The A*30 su-280 pertype is relatively common in West Africa: 13.3% for Mali, 15.4% for Kenya, 16.3% for Uganda, and 23.9% for Mozambique [32]. Although peptide vaccines are by their nature HLA restricted, it may be possible to create a CTL vaccine directed against EBOV for use alone or in conjunction with a whole protein vaccine to produce an antibody response in tandem, by incorporating additional 285 Class I peptides from epitopes targeted by controllers to broaden the HLA coverage of the vaccine. MHC binding algorithms hosted by the IEDB predict that YQVNNLEEI will bind strongly to the MHC of HLA-A*02:06, HLA-A*02:03 and HLA-A*02:01 individuals (Supplementary Material Table 2) [65].

[42] This suggests that the same approach could be applied to SARS-CoV-2 which has conserved regions in nucleocapsid which is located within the virus (see multiple sequence alignment in Supplementary Material Figure 7 and Supplementary 305 Material Figure 8). Antigenic escape allows a virus to retain fitness despite an immune response to vaccination [20]. Picking conserved regions for vaccine targeting is an important part of mitigating this problem. Coronavirus spike protein, for example, may be particularly susceptible to mutation meaning that antigenic escape would be likely if the spike protein was targeted by a coron-310 avirus vaccine, making it difficult to achieve durable protection. [74] A recent paper conducted a population genetic analysis of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes showing that the virus has evolved into two major types: L and S, with changes in their relative frequency after the outbreak possibly due to human intervention resulting in selection pressure [62]. 315 We took all possible 424 9mer peptide sequences from the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein sequences available and evaluated each peptide for HLA restriction using NetMHC 4.0 and NetMHCpan 4.0 [65][30][1]. We analyzed 9mer peptide sequences because these are often associated with superior MHC binding properties than class I peptides of other lengths [63][18].

ELISPOT analysis of 350 PBMCs taken from the peripheral blood of COVID-19 controllers and progressors to assess the presence of a differential response to the 53 peptides could lead to a broadly applicable protective CTL vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 by incorporating peptides into the vaccine that are more commonly targeted for CD8+ attack by the controllers versus the progressors.
