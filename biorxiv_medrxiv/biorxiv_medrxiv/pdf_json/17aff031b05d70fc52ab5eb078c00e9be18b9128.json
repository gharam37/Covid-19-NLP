IVIG can rapidly increase the IgG level in the blood, directly neutralize exogenous antigens, and regulate multiple immune functions, including regulating immune media, and improving the immune capacity of natural immune cells and lymphocytes. IVIG has been wildly used in the treatment of severe bacterial and viral infection and sepsis [10, 11] . Some studies demonstrated its clinical efficacy, especially in the case of viral infectious diseases [12] ; whereas, other studies failed to show its therapeutic efficacy, leading to great controversy on its clinical application in acute respiratory virus infection [13] . The latest version of China therapeutic guidelines of COVID-19 suggested IVIG as a selective treatment method. However, due to lacking specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the efficacy of IVIG remains to be elucidated. It is noticed that use of IVIG is recommendation in the list of selective methods in the COVID-19 therapeutic guidelines of WHO [4, 7, 14, 15] .",

Since immunoglobulin was not the specific antibody to any virus and the clinical evidence for its efficacy was limited, some researchers held the oppose view about usage of immunoglobulin in acute virus infection [18, 19] . In COVID-19 treatment guidance of China and WHO, the recommendation on immunoglobulin usage is different.

To exclude the influence of the bias on the study, we performed the regression analysis on the potential factors. Univariate survival analysis showed that APACHE II and SOFA sores were the risk factor which related with the outcome. In further analysis, we found APACHE II and SOFA scores were relatively low in most enrolled patients. This is consisted with the characteristics of this disease, i.e., only in the patients with severe lung injury, but few other organs injury. COX regression confirmed that critical type COVID-19 patients showed poor prognosis and IVIG improved their survival rate. Although IVIG does not show therapeutic effect on the whole cohort, it can be beneficial to the critical type patients. In addition, COX regression also showed that lymphopenia was the risk of poor prognosis. This observation is consistent with the previous study reported that 35%-83% COVID-19 patients showed lymphocyte count decreased, and persistent lymphopenia was related with the poor outcome [26].

Pharmacological studies suggested that high dose of IVIG pulse therapy leads to the formation of immunocomplex with pathogen antigen, which can be further cleared in circulation[12]. Immunoglobulin has been used in the treatment of virus infectious diseases, such as viral pneumonia, and autoimmune diseases[13]. In patients with severe COVID-19, but not in patients with mild disease, lymphopenia is a common feature, with drastically reduced numbers of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells[6, 24,25].
