Accelerated development 64 of mAbs in a pandemic setting could be reduced to 5-6 months compared to the 65 traditional timeline of 10-12 months (Kelley B., Developing monoclonal antibodies at 66 pandemic speed, Nat Biotechnol, in press).

Another mechanism of 78 SARS-CoV neutralization was recently described for mAb CR3022, which bound a 79 cryptic epitope only accessible when at least two out of the three S B domains of a S 80 trimer were in the open conformation 25,26 .

Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) structures of SARS-58 CoV-2 S in two distinct functional states 6,9 along with cryoEM and crystal structures of 59 SARS-CoV-2 S B in complex with hACE2 16-18 revealed dynamic states of S B domains, 60 providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. 61 Passive administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could have a major 62 impact on controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by providing immediate protection, 63 complementing the development of prophylactic vaccines. Accelerated development 64 of mAbs in a pandemic setting could be reduced to 5-6 months compared to the 65 traditional timeline of 10-12 months (Kelley B., Developing monoclonal antibodies at 66 pandemic speed, Nat Biotechnol, in press).

Analysis of the S glycoprotein sequences of the 2,229 SARS-CoV-2 158 isolates reported to date indicates that several mutations have occurred with variable 159 frequency on the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain (Extended DataFig. 7a-b)but no 160 mutations arose within the epitope recognized by S309 mAb.

A synergistic effect between two non-competing anti-RBD mAbs has 221 been already reported for SARS-CoV 43 and our data extend this observation to CoV-2, providing a proof-of-concept for the use of mAbs combinations to prevent or 223 control SARS-CoV-2. 224In summary, our study identifies S309 as a human mAb with broad neutralizing 225 activity against multiple sarbecoviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, via recognition of a 226 highly conserved epitope in the S B domain comprising the N343-glycan (N330 in 227 SARS-CoV S). Furthermore, S309 can recruit effector mechanisms and synergizes 228 with weakly neutralizing mAbs, which may mitigate the risk of viral escape. Our data 229 indicate the potential to discover potently neutralizing pan-sarbecovirus mAbs, 230 highlight antigenic sites to include in vaccine design, and pave the way to support 231 preparedness for future sarbecovirus outbreaks.

Two days after transfection, cells were collected for immunostaining 298 with mAbs. An Alexa647-labelled secondary antibody anti-human IgG Fc was used for 299 detection. Binding of mAbs to transfected cells was analyzed by flow-cytometry using a 300 ZE5 Cell Analyzer (Biorard) and FlowJo software (TreeStar). Positive binding was 301 defined by differential staining of CoV-S-transfectants versus mock-transfectants. 302 303 Affinity determination and competition experiments using Octet (BLI, biolayer 304 -coated sensors with different concentration of SARS-CoV RBD (Sino 310 Biological) or SARS-CoV-2 RBD (produced in house; residues 331-550 of spike protein 311 from BetaCoV/Wuhan-Hu-1/2019, accession number MN908947). The highest RBD 312 concentration was 10 \u00b5g/ml, then serially diluted 1:2.5. Dissociation was recorded for 313 9 minutes by moving the sensors to wells containing KB.

After blocking with 1% 335 BSA in PBS, antibodies es were added to the plates in a concentration range between 336 5 and 0.000028 \u00b5g/ml and incubated for 1 h at RT. Plates were washed and secondary 337 Ab Goat Anti Human IgG-AP (Southern Biotechnology: 2040-04) was added. 338 were performed using ExpiCHO-S cells transient transfected with 343 SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 S as targets. Target cells were incubated with titrated 344 concentrations of mAbs and after 10 minutes incubated with primary human NK cells 345 as effector cells at an effector:target ratio of 9:1. NK cells were isolated from fresh 346 blood of healthy donors using the MACSxpress NK Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat. 347 Nr.: 130-098-185). ADCC was measured using LDH release assay (Cytotoxicity 348 Detection Kit (LDH) (Roche; Cat.

Nr.: MINI67) as targets. Target cells were incubated with titrated 353 concentrations of mAbs for 10minutes, followed by incubation with human PBMCs 354 isolated from healthy donors that were fluorescently labeled with Cell Trace Violet 355 (Invitrogen, Cat. Nr.: C34557) at an effector:target ratio of 20:1. After an overnight 356 incubation at 37\u00b0C, cells were stained with anti-human CD14-APC antibody (BD 357 Pharmingen, Cat.

Antibody-mediated 358 phagocytosis was determined by flow cytometry, gating on CD14 + cells that were 359 double positive for cell trace violet and PKH67. 360 Determination of mAb-dependent activation of human FcgRIIIa or FcgRIIa was 361 performed using ExpiCHO cells transiently transfected with SARS-CoV-2 S 362 (BetaCoV/Wuhan-Hu-1/2019), incubated with titrated concentrations of mAbs for 10 363 minutes. ExpiCHO cells then were incubated with Jurkat cells expressing FcgRIIIa 364 receptor or FcgRIIa on their surface and stably transfected with NFAT-driven luciferase 365 gene (Promega, Cat. Nr.: G9798 and G7018) at an effector to target ratio of 6:1 for 366 FcgRIIIa and 5:1 for FcgRIIa. Activation of human FcgRs in this bioassay results in the 367 NFAT-mediated expression of the luciferase reporter gene. Luminescence was 368 measured after 21 hours of incubation at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2, using the Bio-Glo-TM 369 Luciferase Assay Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. the MLV transfer vector encoding aluciferase reporter using the 376 Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Life Technologies) according to the 377 manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated for 5 hours at 37\u00b0C with 8% CO2 with 378 OPTIMEM transfection medium. DMEM containing 10% FBS was added for 72 hours. 379 VeroE6 cells or DBT cells transfected with human ACE2 were cultured in DMEM 380 containing 10% FBS, 1% PenStrep and plated into 96 well plates for 16-24 hours. 381 Concentrated pseudovirus with or without serial dilution of antibodies was incubated 382 for 1 hour and then added to the wells after washing 3X with DMEM. After 2-3 hours 383 DMEM containing 20% FBS and 2% PenStrep was added to the cells for 48 hours. 384 Following 48 hours of infection, One-Glo-EX (Promega) was added to the cells and 385 incubated in the dark for 5-10 minutes prior to reading on a Varioskan LUX plate reader 386 (ThermoFisher). Measurements were done in duplicate and relative luciferase units 387 (RLU) were converted to percent neutralization and plotted with a non-linear regression 388 curve fit in PRISM. 389 390 Live virus neutralization assay 391 SARS-CoV-2 strain 2019-nCoV/USA_WA1/2020 was obtained from the Centers for 392 Disease Control and Prevention (gift of Natalie Thornburg). Virus was passaged once 393 in Vero CCL81 cells (ATCC) and titrated by focus-forming assay on Vero E6 cells. 394 Serial dilutions of indicated mAbs were incubated with 10 2 focus forming units (FFU) 395 of SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. MAb-virus complexes were added to Vero E6 cell 396 monolayers in 96-well plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. Subsequently, cells 397 were overlaid with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose in MEM supplemented with 2% FBS. 398 Plates were harvested 30 hours later by removing overlays and fixed with 4% PFA in 399 PBS for 20 minutes at room temperature. Plates were washed and sequentially 400 incubated with 1 \u00b5g/mL of CR3022 46 anti-S antibody and HRP-conjugated goat anti-401 human IgG in PBS supplemented with 0.1% saponin and 0.1% BSA. SARS-CoV-2-402 infected cell foci were visualized using TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL) and 403 of HEK293F cells grown in suspension using FreeStyle 293 expression 409 medium (Life technologies) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 8% CO2 incubator rotating at 130 410 r.p.m, as previously reported 6 . The culture was transfected using 293fectin 411 (ThermoFisher Scientific) with cells grown to a density of 10 6 cells per mL and 412 cultivated for three days. The supernatant was harvested and cells were resuspended 413 for another three days, yielding two harvests. Clarified supernatants were purified 414 using a 5mL Cobalt affinity column (Takara). Purified protein was filtered or 415 concentrated and flash frozen in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 150 mM 416NaCl prior to cryoEM analysis. The SARS-CoV S, HCoV-OC43 S and MERS-CoV S 417 constructs were previously described 14,28 and produced similarly to SARS-CoVsample preparation and data collection. 421 3 \u00b5L of SARS-CoV-2 S at 1.6 mg/mL was mixed with 0.45 \u00b5L of S309 Fab at 7.4 mg/mL 422 for 1 min at room temperature before application onto a freshly glow discharged 1.2/1.3 423UltraFoil grid (300 mesh). Plunge freezing used a vitrobot MarkIV (ThermoFisher 424 Scientific) using a blot force of 0 and 6.5 second blot time at 100% humidity and 25\u00b0C. 425Data were acquired using the Leginon software 47 to control an FEI Titan Krios 426 transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan K2 427Summit direct detector and Gatan Quantum GIF energy filter, operated in zero-loss 428 mode with a slit width of 20 eV. Automated data collection was carried out using 429Leginon at a nominal magnification of 130,000x with a pixel size of 0.525 \u00c5 with tilt 430 angles ranging between 20\u02da and 50\u02da, as previously described 48 .
