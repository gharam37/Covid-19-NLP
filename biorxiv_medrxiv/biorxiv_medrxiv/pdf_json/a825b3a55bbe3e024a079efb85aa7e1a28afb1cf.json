With the sharp increase in cases globally, many countries have adopted these \"social distancing\" practices at an unprecedented scale. In the US, on March 16, 2020 seven counties in the San Francisco Bay Area ordered residents to shelter in place in response to evidence of community transmission of COVID-19. Over the subsequent days and weeks, other cities and states followed suit.
