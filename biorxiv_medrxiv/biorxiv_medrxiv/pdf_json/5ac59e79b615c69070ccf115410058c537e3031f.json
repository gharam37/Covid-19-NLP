Therefore, there are still debates on whether pregnant women have a different disease course and outcomes, considering the physiological changes in cell-mediated immunity and pulmonary function during pregnancy. 15 In this study, we conducted retrospective cohort study to compare the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant women and non-pregnant women. We hope these findings will facilitate efforts, both in China and globally, to make and manage public health planning for pregnant women with COVID-19.",

Finally, we recruited 66 hospitalized patients with with data collection form. Two study investigators (CH, LZ) independently collected and validated the data. Maternal throat swab samples from the upper respiratory tract were collected at admission in viral-transport medium. Amniotic fluid samples, placenta samples, neonatal throat and anal swab samples were collected immediately after delivery in the operating room. Breastmilk samples were also collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing to evaluate the evidence of vertical transmission.

Therefore, a cohort study is necessary and urgent to provide a reliable guideline for management of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. To this end, we reported a cohort analysis of clinical outcomes in 31 pregnant women and 35 non-pregnant women with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. To our knowledge, this is the first cohort study that has been reported to date. Previously, a descriptive study demonstrated that the clinical characteristics of pregnant patients with COVID-19 resembled those of non-pregnant patients with COVID-19. 12 However, we found a shorter interval from onset to hospitalization and severer COVID-19 in pregnant patients than non-pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This phenomenon could be partly explained by the special states of immune suppression and physiological adaptive changes during pregnancy. Infectious pneumonia is an essential cause of morbidity and mortality in pregnant women. For example, H1N1 virus caused a higher rate of hospital admission and an increasing risk for pregnancy complications in pregnant women than the general population. 27 In our study, despite no death in pregnant women and neonates, our finding suggested that more attention should be paid to the pregnant women especially to those who had a history of exposure to the All rights reserved.

Fever was the most common symptom in the general population, as previously reported (over 80%). 28, 29 In our study, we found the similar pattern of symptoms in pregnant women, while the proportion of fever in pregnant women was far lower than that in non-pregnant women (54\u00b78% vs. 87\u00b75%, p = 0\u00b7006). Temperature screening has been the most proposed and useful method to identify the suspected patients in population. Thus, a low proportion of fever might increase the risk of missing the suspected patients in pregnant women. Furthermore, five (16\u00b71%) pregnant women who were diagnosed by laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 did not have any initial symptoms but had the history of exposure, and one (3\u00b72%) pregnant woman had an initial symptom of diarrhea. Importantly, chest CT scan of all patients showed moderate to severe inflammation in lungs. These findings plainly indicated that it was not enough to screen pregnant women for COVID-19 based solely on clinical symptoms.

            "text": "There were numerous differences in the laboratory findings between pregnant patients and non-pregnant patients. Compared with nonpregnant patients, pregnant patients had more white blood cell and neutrophil counts, shorter prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, higher level of D-dimer, procalcitonin and aspartate aminotransferase. Moreover, there was no statistical difference in the proportion of abnormal levels of alanine transaminase and serum creatinine between these two groups, while pregnant patients had higher level of alanine transaminase and lower level of serum creatinine than non-pregnant patients. These abnormalities suggested that pregnant patients might have diminished cell-mediated immunity, hypercoagulable state, and increased hepatic injury compared with non-pregnant patients. These abnormalities were not unique between pregnant and non-pregnant patients with COVID-19. Previous studies showed that pregnant patients were more likely to have complications and adverse outcomes such as sepsis and hepatic injury with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection. 30, 31 Monitoring the severity of COVID-19 is imperative for the adjustment of treatment strategies. Though analyzing cytokines in peripheral blood of 123 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, Wan et al. found that IL-6 were higher in severe patients than in mild patients. 23 Another team observed the similar phenomenon and further demonstrated significant decrease of IL-6 after treatment for patients with severe COVID-19. 22 Our study showed that pregnant patients had increased IL-6 level compared with non-pregnant patients, which is consistent with our previous finding that more pregnant patients were diagnosed as severe or critical pneumonia than non-pregnant patients. However, in our study, although the median level of IL-6 was higher in severe/critical group than moderate group, no significant difference was identified between these two groups. NLR and SII are the inflammatory markers which have been reported to be associated with the progress of disease. 32, 33 We found that NLR and SII were positively correlated with the severity of COVID-19. It seems that these two inflammatory indices have a higher sensitivity than IL-6 on evaluating the severity of COVID-19. Besides, unlike IL-6, NLR and SII could be easily calculated from blood standard examination. A large, prospective study is necessary to investigate the value of NLR and SII in monitoring the severity of COVID-19.",
