We estimate the probabilities of success (PoS) of clinical trials for vaccines and other anti-infective therapeutics using 43,414 unique triplets of clinical trial, drug, and disease between January 1, 2000, and January 7, 2020, yielding 2,544 vaccine programs and 6,829 non-vaccine programs targeting infectious diseases. The overall estimated PoS for an industry-sponsored vaccine program is 39.6%, and 16.3% for an industry-sponsored anti-infective therapeutic. Among industry-sponsored vaccines programs, only 12 out of 27 disease categories have seen at least one approval, with the most successful being against monkeypox (100%), rotavirus (78.7%), and Japanese encephalitis (67.6%). The three infectious diseases with the highest PoS for industry-sponsored nonvaccine therapeutics are smallpox (100%), CMV (31.8%), and onychomycosis (29.8%). Nonindustry-sponsored vaccine and non-vaccine development programs have lower overall PoSs: 6.8% and 8.2%, respectively. Viruses involved in recent outbreaks-MERS, SARS, Ebola, Zika-have had a combined total of only 45 non-vaccine development programs initiated over the past two decades, and no approved therapy to date (Note: our data was obtained just before the COVID-19 outbreak and do not contain information about the programs targeting this disease.) These estimates offer guidance both to biopharma investors as well as to policymakers seeking to identify areas most likely to be undeserved by private-sector engagement and in need of public-sector support.",

In developed countries, routine prophylactic vaccination and effective treatment options have led to the control or complete elimination of several deadly infectious diseases through individual and herd immunity, preventing millions of deaths and untold suffering each year. This prophylaxis dramatically reduces the burden on the healthcare system and society as a whole. In addition, the deaths, hospitalizations, and treatment costs avoided by these measures have led to significant economic savings (Ehreth, 2003; R\u00e9my et al., 2015 ; US Department of Health and Human Services, 2017).",

We make the assumption that each program must transition from phase 1 to phase 2 to phase 3 to approval. We say that a drug development program has reached phase i if it is observed, or can be inferred, that there is at least one trial in phase i. The probability of a drug development program transitioning from phase i to phase j (PoSij) can be computed using the simple ratio Nj/Ni, where Ni is the number of drug development programs initiated at phase i (where i = 1, 2, or 3) with known outcomes between phase i and phase j (where j = 2, 3, or \"A\" which denotes regulatory approval), and Nj is the number of drug development programs among the former that made it to phase j.",

In addition, we process the data such that more specific diseases (e.g., rabies) can be identified instead of broad vaccine classes (e.g., vector-borne disease vaccines). Clinical trials that are not involved in any vaccine development program will be deemed to be part of a 'non-vaccine' drug development program. We derive 43,414 data points in total. We define an 'industry-sponsored' development program as one where there is at least one commercial company involved in any stage of clinical development.
