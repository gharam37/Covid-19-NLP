Faced with such brutally difficult decisions, it is essential that as many people as possible understand (1) why lockdown interventions represent the only realistic way for individual countries to contain their nationallevel epidemics before they turn into public health catastrophes, (2) why these need to be implemented so early, so aggressively and for such extended periods, and (3) why international cooperation to conditionally re-open trade and travel between countries that have successfully eliminated local transmission represents the only way to contain the pandemic at global level. Here we present simplified arithmetic models of COVID-19 transmission, control and elimination in userfriendly Shiny and Excel formats that allow non-specialists to explore, query, critique and understand the containment decisions facing their country and the world at large. Based on parameter values representative of the United Republic of Tanzania, which is still early enough in its epidemic cycle and response to avert a national catastrophe, national containment and elimination with less than 10 deaths is predicted for highly rigorous lock down within 5 weeks of the first confirmed cases and maintained for 15 weeks. However, elimination may only be sustained if case importation from outside the country is comprehensively contained by isolating for three weeks all incoming travellers, except those from countries certified as COVID-free in the future. Any substantive relaxation of these assumptions, specifically shortening the lock-down period, less rigorous lockdown or imperfect importation containment, may facilitate epidemic re-initiation, resulting in over half a million deaths unless rigorously contained a second time. Removing contact tracing and isolation has minimal impact on successful containment trajectories because high incidence of similar mild symptoms caused by other common pathogens attenuates detection success of COVID-19 testing. Nevertheless, contact tracing is recommended as an invaluable epidemiological surveillance platform for monitoring and characterizing the epidemic, and for understanding the influence of interventions on transmission dynamics.",

We coin the term arithmetic modelling, as distinct from the ubiquitously used term mathematical modelling, to convey the fact that it uses only addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, rounding off, a few conditional statements (eg. if, less than/greater than, and/or), and two unavoidable power terms, to make the necessary calculations. This tool includes no differential equations, calculus, limits, distributions, stochastic simulations or agent-based approaches that would render it opaque to most non-specialist readers, such as medical and public health practitioners, decision-makers, journalists and the general public. The model is presented in userfriendly Excel\u00ae and Shiny\u00ae formats that allow non-specialists to explore, query, critique and understand the containment decisions facing their country and the world at large. For those who wish to satisfy themselves that the calculations make intuitive sense, the Excel\u00ae version provides a complementary spreadsheet format in which the formula for each cell can be critically examined. For those content to accept the underlying arithmetic, the Shiny\u00ae format provides a convenient interactive web application that can be used on any device. While a formal mathematical description of this model has been critically reviewed by specialist experts, it is provided only as an online supplement because none of the principles, assumptions or predictions are entirely new, and because in our experience nothing deters non-specialists from reading an article faster than equations do.",

[51] [52] [53] The exact numerical predictions should therefore not be used to confidently define precise operational timelines for introducing and sustaining interventions, or set effectiveness thresholds required of specific containment measures. Instead, the purpose of this tool is to help users broadly understand the inevitable consequences of an uncontained epidemic, explore the likely outcomes a wide range of different possible containment strategies, identify those which could plausibly succeed and understand the failures of those which seem unlikely to do so. prospectively and will be too late to quantify retrospectively.

In this simulation, a rigorous 15-week lock down was initiated from week 5 onwards and complemented by complete containment of imported cases, as well as contact tracing and isolation of confirmed cases. Rigorous lock down was assumed to achieve 90% reduction of exposure behaviours by 90% of the population.

Note, however, that even these alarming projections for the rate of expansion of the epidemic and the rate of contraction required to contain it may under-represent the scale of the challenge in real epidemics. For example, at the outset of the epidemic in China, numbers of confirmed cases doubled every week. 31, 79 Furthermore, subsequent analyses allowing for frequent carriage without overt symptoms indicate much higher viral reproduction rates than assumed in table 1, and suggest true doubling time for all cases may be less than 3 days. 65, 67 Interesting, almost exactly the same containment trajectory is predicted even if contact tracing and isolation is completely removed from the intervention package (Supplementary figure 1) , resulting in only 276 more cases and one more death. The explanation for this becomes apparent when one examines the trajectories of confirmed versus all cases: Even though the number of real cases never approaches an optimistically-assumed full testing capacity of 11,400 patients per week, half of all cases are never tested because they are asymptomatic and most of the remainder are only mildly symptomatic, so they get lost in the mass of other people who appear equally sick for unrelated to is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

Preventing reintroduction requires isolation of all incoming travellers, except those coming from countries that may be certified as free of local transmission by WHO in the future, to achieve 100% prevention of onward local transmission ( Figure  1 ). Even 90% containment of imported cases seems unlikely to protect the country against reintroduction of the virus and re-initiation of the epidemic ( Figure 2G and H). Tanzania therefore did the right thing by isolating all inbound travelers since March 23 rd (over 600 so far) for two weeks following their arrival). However, for such importation containment measures to effectively exclude new cases from a COVID-free Tanzania in the future, isolation periods may need to be extended to three weeks. 2, 3, 5, 7, 69, 70, 78 However, it is also notable that all the scenarios in figure two, except for panels G and H, assume 100% effective containment of imported cases. It is therefore clear that local transmission must be eliminated before such rigorous control of inbound travellers can usefully protect the country against reintroduction.",

The implications of such an uncontained rebound scenario are essentially identical to doing nothing in the first place: In all cases, 99% of the population is expected to become infected over about a year, resulting in approximately 540,000 deaths and ICU demand exceeding capacity about 800 times over. It is also worth noting that total national hospital inpatient capacity of approximately 50,000 beds 80 would be overwhelmed by cases of severe COID-19 disease peaking at 2.3 million over a three-week period. Under such conditions of a full-blown public health catastrophe, the mitigating effect of stronger health systems in high income countries are largely negated, so our predictions of over half a million deaths in Tanzania compare well with those of others for the United Kingdom, 29 which has a similar population size. Considering also the travel distances and household costs of hospital attendance in Tanzania [81] [82] [83] [84] , it also raises the question as to whether severe COVID patients should be cared for in hospitals and other health facilities [85] [86] [87] [88] which are already 52% understaffed 89 or at home [85] [86] [87] [88] with support from a rapidly mobilized cadre of Community Health Workers, for which well-characterized curricula and training platforms already exist.

Three of the four scenarios in figure 2 include periods of two month or more when few if any confirmed cases are expected, but some mild cases persist that can re-seed the whole epidemic afresh. The predicted persistence of the epidemic despite total predicted cases dropping below zero is an artefact of the simplified deterministic form of the model, which calculates case numbers as a continuous decimal outcome until it drops below 0.1, at which point it is set to 0 because the probability of elimination is 90% or better. The take-home message is nevertheless clear: persist with rigorous lock-down until one can be sure that elimination has been achieved, drawing on statistical approaches used by veterinary epidemiologists to certify elimination with imperfect surveillance systems. [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] The vital importance of ambition and rigour to lockdown outcome: Who dares loses least! As illustrated by figure 4C and D, it is now crucial that Tanzania urgently builds on that early momentum to ramp up lock down efforts to the most rigorous level practically attainable. The implications of even a slightly less rigorous lock down appear less daunting in epidemiological terms but far more severe in practical and economic terms, because it greatly prolongs the lockdown period required: Even reducing coverage and effectiveness of personal protection measures by only 10%, from 90% to 80% requires that the lock down period is extended by more than 150%, from 15 weeks to 40 weeks ( Figure 4C and D) . The practical social and economic sustainability of such a protracted lock down period is very questionable, but much can be learned from the predicted benefits of getting such an imperfect lock down started in good time: The 1,108 cases and 11 deaths predicted over the course of such a \"slow burn\" containment campaign are only marginally higher than for the best case scenario illustrated in figure 1. It is therefore important to get some form of reasonably rigorous lock down in place as early as possible, and then intensify it as rapidly as possible. Like any race, it is critical to get an early head-start by any means possible, but then build up speed towards a strong finish.",

While high income countries move to facilitate population-wide compliance with direct financial support and augmented social services, different tactics will be required in low income countries like Tanzania. Although Tanzania is urbanizing very rapidly, most of the population still resides in rural areas 99 where propagation of directly-transmitted diseases like COVID-19 is always less intense. Fortunately, Tanzania is currently in the midst of this year's farming season, during which many rural families are out in the fields where social distancing is relatively easy. While farming season also conveniently brings a lull in trading activity at commercial hubs in rural towns and villages, it also represents a seasonal low point in the domestic food reserves of many rural households, so selective food support may be invaluable for enabling the most vulnerable families to comply effectively with self-quarantine and self-isolation directives. However, the growing urban population represents a much larger challenge, because far fewer people rely on farming for their livelihoods. Many live in crowded informal settlements where lack of shelter, water, sanitation and space, relying on unreliable, informal sources of income to survive on a day-to-day basis. Informal livelihoods and settlements in the busiest urban centres of the country will therefore require particularly urgent attention and creativity, to support daily food, water and hygiene needs. It may also be useful to consider providing safe transport with managed social distancing (to be followed by self-isolation) for those with options to sit out the epidemic with family and friends in rural areas.",

Many of the greatest public health campaigns in history have necessitated an authoritarian style, and it may be necessary for people all over the world to temporarily embrace and accept new restriction measures they would otherwise justifiably describe as draconian. Perhaps the single most important take-home message of the widelyaccepted 80-20 rule of epidemiology (less than 20% of people cause more than 80% of transmission) 110 is that the extremes of human circumstances and behaviour, especially during mass gatherings and population movements, are more important to the survival of pathogens than the average. It inevitably follows that such exceptions are vitally important to target if one wishes to eliminate COVID-19. [111] [112] [113] [114] Again, it is worth remembering Typhoid Mary 109 , who resisted repeated efforts to get her out of the kitchen and did nothing to disprove stereotypes about the stubborn Irish. She repeatedly returned to working as a cook because it paid better and frequently changed jobs as people fell ill around her, even changing her name to evade more than 30 years of quarantines imposed on her. It took 4 policemen over three hours to apprehend her despite a stealthy approach and forced entry to her home. Eventually Mary was found hiding in an outside closet at the rear of a neighbour's house, and things remained spicy following her arrest:",

For example, the tracing of transmission to a relatively small number of clusters in Korea, and especially the incrimination of venues like the Shincheonji Church provide invaluable insights that guide more rigorous, effective follow up on lock down measures. 64 In Ireland, early observations that mean size of close contact clusters had shrunk from 20 to 5 were reported to the public as an encouraging early sign that behavioural interventions were impacting risks of onward transmission. Without such essential detailed information about how transmission persists, as well as the strengths and weakness of ongoing intervention efforts, national containment programmes would be flying blind.",

In any case, population-wide testing of mildly symptomatic cases becomes unhelpful as a guide to targeting containment measures: How does one selectively target those at immediate risk when that means everyone? And how would we attempt contract tracing if we allowed the epidemic to grow to tens or hundreds of thousands of new cases each week? Note, however, that the expected failure of contact tracing, and indeed testing generally, is just one more good reason to contain national COVID-19 epidemics before they progress from emergencies (Figures 1 and 4) into outright catastrophes (Figure 2 ).",

Learning lessons from other diseases like endemic malaria, which is primarily a chronic illness transmitted by semi-immune adult carriers, 121 the term asymptomatic may well be a misnomer not only because some individuals become infectious before exhibiting symptoms, 1, 3, 5, 16, 19, 22, 23, 74 but also because it is often applied to those who shrug off mild symptoms to get on with their daily lives. 8, 122, 123 A particularly important caveat arising from current uncertainty about the role of cryptic carriers is that it also has a major influence on estimation of fatality rate for infections rather than clinical cases. The latest analyses allowing for this phenomenon suggest that fatality rates are may be 10 to 40 times lower per infection than per confirmed case, 63,65 consistent with our conclusion that the vast majority of cases are never confirmed. While fatality rates are difficult to estimate directly, 124, 125 these modelling analyses support the conclusions of the most controlled empirical epidemiological studies, indicating that the COVID-19 fatality rates may be comfortably below 1%. 21 The surge of severe cases and fatalities in an uncontained epidemic may therefore peak at a far lower level than those predicted in figure 2. However, much of the variation between fatality rate estimates appears related to geographic differences in health system capacity and burden, 125,126 so low income countries will be much more vulnerable. Even if the best worst-case scenario proves to be less catastrophic than previously projected, 63,65 it will nevertheless overwhelm critical care capacity several times over and should be avoided if at all possible.",

Faced with such brutally difficult decisions, it is essential to policy-makers, health professionals and the general public that as many people as possible understand why lock down interventions represent the only realistic way for individual countries to contain their national-level epidemics before they turn into public health catastrophes.

Rigorous lock down was assumed to achieve 90% reduction of exposure behaviours by 90% of the population. Complete 100% containment of imported cases assumes that all inbound international visitors are fully isolated for three weeks, 2,3,5,7,69,70,78 except those coming from countries that may be certified as free of local transmission by WHO in the future.
