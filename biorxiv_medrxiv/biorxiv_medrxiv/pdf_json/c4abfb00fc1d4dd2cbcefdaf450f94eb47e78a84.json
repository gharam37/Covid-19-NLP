We also calculated the number of individuals without an underlying condition that could be considered at-risk because of their age, using thresholds from 50-70 years. The list of underlying conditions relevant to COVID-19 disease was determined by mapping conditions listed in GBD to the guidelines published by WHO and public health agencies in the UK and US.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and chronic respiratory disease (CRD) were the most prevalent conditions in males and females aged 50+ years. African countries with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and Island countries with a high prevalence of diabetes, also had a high share of the population at increased risk.

Severe cases have those symptoms, would require hospitalisation if available, and are at risk of increased mortality. 4, 5 In a recent report from the USA, underlying conditions were reported in 71% (732/1037) of individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 and 94% (173/184) of deaths. 1 The World Health Organization (WHO) as well as public health agencies in countries including the UK and US, have issued guidelines on who is considered to be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness. [6] [7] [8] This includes individuals with cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, chronic respiratory disease (CRD) and a range of other chronic conditions. Such conditions increase the risk of needing hospital-based treatment such as oxygen supplementation or mechanical ventilation. A large proportion of the additional health care burden of COVID-19 epidemics is likely to result from infection of those with underlying conditions. Identifying at-risk populations is important not only for making projections of the likely health burden in countries, 9, 10 but also for the design of effective strategies that aim to reduce the risk of transmission to people in target groups. This is sometimes termed shielding, defined as \"a measure to protect extremely vulnerable people by minimising interaction between those who are extremely vulnerable and others.\" 11 It has the potential to reduce mortality in vulnerable groups (direct benefits), while at the same time mitigating the expected surge in demand for hospital beds (indirect benefits), which is critical where systems risk being strained by the national epidemic. However, trying to shield an excessive proportion of a population may strain country resources and reduce the overall effectiveness of shielding. A detailed assessment of the number of at-risk individuals can inform possible shielding strategies. If a vaccine becomes available in the future, it could also be used to inform the process of prioritising different groups, based on risk.",

When we applied our method, based on the calculation of and , to the prevalence of each condition reported in the study, we were able to reproduce the same percentage share of the population at increased risk. This provides some reassurance that our method will provide a reasonable approximation of the atrisk proportion if the same input data on disease prevalence is used. The GBD prevalence estimates for Sweden were substantially higher than the estimates from the EHR data, and so we estimate a much higher proportion of the population to be at increased risk (35 vs 22%). Many of the prevalent cases estimated by GBD would not have been severe enough to be recorded in EHRs, which is likely the major reason for the difference. For example, over half of the CKD cases included in GBD prevalence estimates represent early stage disease (CKD stage 1 or 2) which is common and rarely has symptoms. 23 Several other underlying conditions estimated by GBD are also likely to be undiagnosed in many individuals e.g. hypertensive heart disease, compensated chronic liver disease, .

In the absence of a vaccine, a key option to mitigate the pandemic is to shield at-risk individuals by more intensive physicaldistancing measures than those in the wider population. This may be especially important at times and places where health systems risk being overwhelmed by cases. Other infection control measures include provision of personal protective equipment and intensive testing of health and social care workers in maximum contact with at-risk individuals. At a minimum, timely and effective communication should be provided to communities on who within them is at increased risk. Among those who are identified, governments will rely heavily on their adherence to guidelines. This would allow practical individual-level steps to be taken, such as increased hygiene, physical isolation and home-delivered food and medical care. 6 As more evidence emerges on the risk associated with different conditions, guidelines could be refined and shielding policies tailored to different risk groups e.g. isolation for those at very high risk, and less stringent measures (e.g. social distancing) for those with a lower level of increased risk. Community-level shielding approaches, including vacating houses or public buildings to physically isolate small groups of people at increased risk, may also be considered, though these will require stringent infection control arrangements, especially in crowded settings, 24 and adherence may be low if at-risk individuals are daily wage earners or people caring for children e.g. grandparents. 25 The association between the prevalence of underlying conditions and other national characteristics, such as economic development, is complex. The prevalence of many of these conditions (HIV/AIDS may be an exception) reflect the epidemiological transition 26 but survival with these conditions may reflect the performance of the health system. 27 Hence, it is important to look at the data for each country, which goes beyond what we can report in this paper. We provide a spreadsheet tool (available at https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/) that can be used for rapid assessment (and visualisation) of the estimated number and percentage of country populations targeted under different shielding policies. This allows different health conditions to be included/excluded, different age thresholds to be assessed, and different choices about key assumptions e.g. estimates of the ratio , and the multimorbidity fraction by age. Prevalence data included in our spreadsheet can be updated as more evidence emerges on the importance (or otherwise) of specific conditions and their severities e.g. early stage CKD, simple hypertension etc.",

For example, there is growing evidence in support of face-masks as a means to prevent transmission by those wearing them. 28 If proven to be effective, or other measures emerge, 29 this could be a practical way of reducing exposure among those who are unable to avoid contact with others. Alternative shielding approaches, so that target groups are supported to reduce physical contacts (e.g. through incentives to reduce or abstain from work), can also be considered.",

As our understanding of this disease evolves, it should be possible to provide greater clarity on the risk of severe COVID -19 disease associated with different underlying conditions at different severities e.g. early stage CKD, compensated liver cirrhosis, moderately severe asthma etc. 6 A detailed multivariate analysis of risk is urgently needed because nearly all underlying conditions are likely to be at least partly confounded by age. Knowledge of the mode of action of the virus is increasing rapidly, especially in relation to its action on cells with ACE2 receptors other than in the lung, in particular in the endothelium and pancreas, which the inflammatory processes associated with diabetes may be involved in cytokine storms that can be fatal. 30 We estimated a similar number of males and females to be at increased risk, although early evidence from China, and later studies in other countries show a higher proportion of deaths in males. 31 Earlier research in mice infected with SARS coronavirus also found an increased male susceptibility mediated by differences in oestrogen receptor signalling, 32 while others have noted the concentration of genes involved in the immune system on the x chromosome. 33 This is a clearly priority for further research.",

The importance of these factors on the severity of COVID-19 is still to be determined, although some national guidelines already include frailty in decisions about treatment. 34 We found that the age threshold for older people without underlying conditions led to a substantial increase in the overall number of people that may be considered at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease. Individuals in developing countries may be frailer than those of an equivalent age in developed countries, and there may be other societal and economic considerations. Older individuals without these underlying conditions could suffer adverse mental health consequences from long periods of isolation. However, of the approximately 1 billion individuals aged 50+ years that we estimate to be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease (table 1) many may not be aware of their underlying condition. 35 For example, CKD has a very high prevalence in many countries, but more than 90% of these cases are likely to be undiagnosed. 23 Age thresholds could therefore play a critical role in shielding the large number of older individuals without a diagnosis. Indeed, while our analysis quantifies numbers who could benefit from shielding, in practice the low coverage of diagnosis and treatment for many chronic conditions in low-income settings means that the age threshold could largely determine the effective target group.",
