Introduction On December 27, 2019, a hospital in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, reported the first mysterious, suspected pneumonia cases to the center of disease control (CDC) in the capital. On January 8, 2020 a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of pneumonia that spread all over China in next three weeks. Since then, the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, spread across the globe in the next month. In March the World Health Organization declared it to be a pandemic, that in the absence of a vaccine became a challenge for mankind with a tendency to grow exponentially if no measure is taken to prevent it [? ] . The incubation period of COVID-19 can last for two weeks or longer [2] . During the period of latent infection, the disease may still be infectious [3] . The virus can spread from person to person through respiratory droplets and close contact [4] .",

On the other hand similar out break in Iran and Italy remained uncontrolled after forty five and sixty days, respectively, with forty five thousands in Iran and one hundred and five thousands people in Italy tested positive as on March 31. In this paper based on mathematical modelling and reported previous evolution in China, we predict the future dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in the second quarter of 2020 in Italy and USA. The lack of testing facilities and sanctions are restricting the authenticity of data from Iran, for the reason we are not including it in the present publication. For our study related to China we have considered the first twenty one days data that is from January 16, till February 05, whereas we have excluded the epicentre province of Hubei, which had a significant issue of under reporting at the early stage and also data inconsistency due to a change of classification guidelines. For Italy and USA we have considered the data from February 01, till April 06.",

In this contribution, we have developed discrete generalized growth model (DG 2 M), the discrete generalized logistic model (DGLM), and discrete generalized Richard model (DGRM). These models have their limitations and are only applicable to some stages, however they provide more accurate measure of the growth in the outbreak. Based on our numerical results we find excellent agreement between the analytical results and the real-time data of coronavirus positively tested cases. The top-down methods have the advantage to study future scenario of the outbreak, provide lower and upper bounds of our predictions, the rate of growth in stages and provide informative implications of the measures taken to control and eradicate the pandemic.",

The outbreak follows a certain rate r of its spread that define the corresponding straight line as expressed in equation (5) . The parameter p describes the spread of the outbreak, it is sub-exponential for 0 < p < 1, exponential for p = 1, and faster than exponential for p > 1.

The obtained results are compared with the real time data of COVID-19 patients obtained from these countries, as shown in figure 2. The plots show that the discrete generalized growth model (DG 2 M) show the gradual increase that matches very good with the real time data of positively tested patients in the three countries. The preventive measures taken in China show a gradual deviation from the DG 2 M model, whereas it is taken over by the DGRM. In case of Italy the gradual deviation of real-time data is also seen, reflecting a slow down of the outbreak, that indicates a positive effect of the steps taken by the government of Italy, such as strict lock down, intercity travel and closure of education sector, and unnecessary travels. In case of USA, the data is showing a deviation from DG 2 M, however it is not significantly close of DGRM. The blue dashed-line indicates the future growth of the coronavirus pandemic following DG 2 M model showing an uncontrolled increase. Whereas the blue line shows the future trend of the pandemic following DGRM model. This implies that to eradicate the COVID-19 successfully it is required to take further strict measures.",

We compare mathematical plots obtained by DG 2 M shown in red dashed-line for r = 1.105 and p = 0.845, whereas the blue dashed-line is plotted by using DGRM for r = 2.117, p = 0.75, \u03b1 = 1.3, and K = 60, 000. In the middle panel we show real-time data for Italy. We compare the mathematical plots obtained by DG 2 M model shown in red dashed-line for r = 2.46 and p = 0.72, whereas the line plotted by means of DGRM has r = 0.33, p = 0.95, \u03b1 = 1, and K = 155, 000; In the lower panel we show the comparison for USA.
