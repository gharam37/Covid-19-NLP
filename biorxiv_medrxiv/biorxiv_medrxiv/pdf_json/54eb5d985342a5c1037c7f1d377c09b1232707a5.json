A recent study in China reported that a total of 2,055 HCPs were diagnosed with COVID-19 (National Health Commission, 2020) . In response to COVID-19 pandemic, Jordan government took extremely proactive measures to prevent the spread of the virus where the state of emergency was declared on March 20, 2020. The country witnessed a complete lockdown, banning people from leaving their homes except for a few specific reasons. Individual violating these orders were subject to three years in prison, a $4,200 fine, or both. The government also implemented an extensive public health awareness campaign utilizing all available media channels (The Jordan Times, 2020). The exponential increase in the number of cases and deaths in betterequipped countries, the spread of COVID-19 misinformation, the lack of medical treatment, and the shortage of properly equipped units to care for patients all could contribute to provoking public fear, anxiety and/or depression, which is usually neglected during crisis and pandemic management (Cao et al., 2020; Chen et al., ",

Furthermore, all participants were asked whether they were worried about being infected with COVID-19 or transmitting it to family members (yes/no question). The GP and USs were asked whether they had underlying chronic conditions (yes/no question). The GP were also asked about their education level and employment status. HCPs were asked about their specialities and exposure to COVID-19 patients and/or providing medical care for COVID-19 patients during this pandemic. USs were asked about their field of study and year level.",

Participants' response ranged from 0 to 3, where 0 means \"Not at all\" and 3 means \"Nearly every day\". The PHQ-9 instrument includes 9 items. Items are scored from 0 to 3 generating a total score ranging from 0 to 27. A total score of 0-4 indicates minimal depression, 5-9 mild depression, 10-14 moderate depression, 15-19 moderately severe depression, and 20-27 severe depression (Schwenk et al., 2011) . The GAD-7 instrument includes 7 items. Items are scored from 0 to 3 generating a total score ranging from 0 to 21.

Similarly, our results showed that females demonstrated a higher risk of anxiety and depression (p<0.05) which is in-line with reported data during epidemics, where women, particularly those working in healthcare, were prone to developing depression and anxiety (Lai et al., 2020; Li L, 2003) . These gender differences in psychological distress including depression and anxiety have been described previously. Several studies have demonstrated that female gender is a risk factor for developing mental illness where women have been reported to have 1.6 greater incidence of depression compared to men.

Several studies have investigated the association between healthcare job-related stress with depression and anxiety (Gao et al., 2012; Mann & Cowburn, 2005; Smolders et al., 2009; S. L. Yoon & Kim, 2013) and such association appears more pronounced during a highly transmissible global pandemic such as COVID-19 (Lai et al., 2020) . Our findings demonstrated that HCPs have a higher risk of developing unfavourable mental health outcomes particularly depression and anxiety. As we anticipated, pulmonologists and ENT physicians scored the highest in comparison to other HCPs. Potential factors that has contributed to these findings include pulmonologists and ENT physicians being in the front-line in treating COVID-19 patients, physician burnout, isolation form family, and feeling helpless due to the nature of this disease. Similar findings are reported by Wong and colleagues (2007) Although ENT physician score for depression and anxiety were statistically non-significant, which could be attributed to small sample size, we strongly believe that they are clinically important and should not be ignored.",

Possible contributor to these findings include the faith that Jordanians have in government. A study conducted by Analyseize Research demonstrated that 95.0% of Jordanians have full faith in government emergency measures to combat COVID-19 outbreak (Analyseize Research, 2020) . Of note, married individuals were found to be at a lower risk of developing depression; GPs (OR= 0.43, 95% CI 0.33-0.55) and HCPs (OR= 0.75, 95% CI 0.56-0.99). Previous research reported that married couples have less tendency to develop depression and anxiety compared with divorced individuals which could be attributed to the impact of marriage on wellbeing and partner support (Kalmijn & Monden, 2006) . Furthermore, our results showed that retired individuals among the GP tend to have a lower risk of developing depression (OR= 0.31, 95% CI 0.14-0.72. p<0.01) when compared to employed or unemployed individuals, which is consistent with previous studies. On one research conducted by Buffel and co-worker, they reported that retired individuals tend to have a lower score of depression during crisis when compared to employed and unemployed persons (Buffel, Van de Velde, & Bracke, 2015) . During crisis there is a reported increase in unemployment rate which is positively correlated with depression rate (Choudhry, Enrico, & Marcello, 2012; Choudhry, Marelli, & Signorelli, 2010) .",

There are limited studies that explored the prevalence of depression and anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic worldwide and in the Middle East specifically, a fact that limited our ability to compare our findings with similar healthcare environment and culture. The sample size of ENT physicians' subgroup was small due to small population in this category nationwide. The impact of time on mental health was not captured here due to the nature of this study and further studies are necessary. It would be useful to repeat the study after the COVID-19 pandemic reach a peak to determine the effect of time on the results. Although depression and anxiety are closely related, depression is almost related to disparate life events, and needs a longer duration in time than the 2-weeks, that are monitored by the PHQ-9 instrument. However, this remark is not valid for anxiety and GAD-7 is relevant to the subject. The above-mentioned remarks may explain the surprising conclusion that USs are more affected and have higher depression and anxiety rates compared to HCPs who are in the centre of the risk and seriously affected by this pandemic disease. Finally, we used an online survey for data collection and therefore, we may have missed some of the targeted population.",
