While it is not possible to rule out differences in outcome due to demographic factors or aspects of the provision of health services, care is needed in drawing conclusions about such differences. The effects of more stringent testing regimes and tighter hospital admission policies are likely to exaggerate apparent fatality rates. High pressure on services, due to rapidly increasing demands, may affect both of these through limitations in staff, equipment and test kits for community testing as well as increasing the threshold of severity for hospital admission. Paradoxically, since the effect of incomplete case ascertainment is partly counter-balanced by the effect of right-censoring, successful attempts as suppression, which reduce the impact of right-censoring, may appear to exaggerate estimates of mortality.",

Conversely, this implies that the IFR will remain uncertain, as demonstrated by the widely differing estimates, [4] until the result of more extensive population testing become available. Another implication is that it is likely that those countries reporting higher mortality rates have a large number of unidentified cases and there is an urgent need to improve our understanding of this in order to predict future trends and the effects of suppression measures. If the apparent differences between German and Italian mortality were to be entirely related to differences in admission and testing criteria, then the implication is that there were at least one million unconfirmed infections in Italy by 30 March 2020.",
