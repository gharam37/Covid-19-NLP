Since a patient with pneumonia of unknown etiology were firstly reported in the city of Wuhan on 30th of Dec, 2019., Subsequently, epidemiological, clinical, radiological, laboratory and genomic findings of this virus gradually revealed by the Chinese and 00 experts around the globe [1] . At current stage, however, two topics emerged as things that needed to be addressed. Firstly, according to latest diagnostic criteria, reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays are recommended as the standard diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-infection. Despite, present studies found that some patients had typical imaging findings, including ground-glass opacity, but negative RT-PCR testing [2] . The false-negative RT-PCR results may cause by many reasons, especially insufficient detection sensitivity in a low viral load scenario [2] . Secondly, although, by using metagenome sequencing, the complete genome sequence, taxonomic position, potential intermediate hosts, and evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 have been already reported [3] [4] [5] [6] , it is more important to monitor the virus mutation and its influence on disease severity and progression. Necessitating the full-length of SARS-CoV-2 genome, metagenome sequencing technology is the latest and most comprehensive approach but still costly. Moreover, in metagenome sequencing library, there are human (host) nucleic acid contamination cannot be eliminated. Inevitably, the carrier RNA introduced by commercial RNA extraction kits presented as contamination in library preparation stage, which indeed impairs the amount of viral sequence readout.",

Using these unique SARS-CoV-2 fragments, we reconstructed six SARS-CoV-2 genomes (mean depth being 186,869\u00d7 and minimum coverage 13,816\u00d7). Only the merged sequence (coverage 1,121,217\u00d7) was used for further analysis. There are five variants called from merged data, including one homozygous variant at SNP (T23569C), and four heterozygotic variants (three SNPs: C4534T, A5522T, C23525T, and one deletion: CT16779C). The phenomenon of heterozygosity had also been reported in previous studies [6, 10] , but we propose that this heterogeneity could be caused by the mutations that occur during viral cultivation or the infection by multi-strain of coronavirus. Table S1 ). Five clades could be identified and labelled, corresponding to the Full genome tree delivered by GISAID (see Figure 1 ). In Figure 2 , we found two peaks in genome sequencing depths, one covering the 5'UTR region (MN908947.3:1-256) and another covering the N region (MN908947.3:28274-29533), which may be associated with the high expression in these two regions during replication of coronavirus [11] [12] . For high sequencing depths in 5'UTR region, a reasonable explanation is that 5'UTRs before ORF1a is necessary for the discontinuous synthesis of sub genomic RNAs in the beta coronaviruses and contains the cis-acting sequences necessary for viral replication [11] .",

This can be explained as the structural composition of coronavirus, also the difference in expression regulation in the host cells regarding sub genomic mRNA [12] [13] [14] In the current study, we, based on the available SARS-CoV-2 virus sequences, designed a set of SARS-CoV-2 enrichment probes. We made six enrichment libraries from one cultured SARS-CoV-2 virus strain to test the enrichment effects and sequenced them on MGI-2000 platform. Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 enrichment probe set-up described in this study showed significance in SARS-CoV-2-specific enrichment. This high specific probe rate with RNA carrier-free approach can function as a useful tool for the SARS-CoV-2 research community, especially in detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in low amounts and monitoring the virus evolution .

Utilization of the synthetic double-stranded DNA, six DNA libraries were constructed through DNA fragmentation, end-repair, adaptor-ligation, and PCR amplification. Subsequently, library hybridization capture was performed by using the SARS-CoV-2 enrichment probe set. The enriched libraries were qualified with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit and equivalent double-stranded DNA libraries were pooled and transformed into a single-stranded circular DNA library through DNA-denaturation and circularisation. DNA nanoballs were generated from single-stranded circular DNA by rolling circle amplification, then qualified with Qubit 2.0 and loaded onto the flow cell and sequenced with PE100 on the MGI-2000 platform (MGI, Shenzhen, China).
