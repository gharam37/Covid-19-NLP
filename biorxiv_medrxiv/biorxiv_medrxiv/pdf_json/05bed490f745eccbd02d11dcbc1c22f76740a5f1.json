Herein, we characterized the site-specific N-glycosylation of S protein at the level of intact glycopeptides. All 22 potential N-glycosites were identified in the S-protein protomer and were found to be preserved among the 753 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. The glycosite occupancy by different glycoforms exhibited remarkable heterogeneity in human cell-expressed protein subunits, including up to 157 N-glycans, mainly of the complex type. In contrast, the insect cell-expressed S protein contained 38 N-glycans, primarily of the high-mannose type. Our results revealed that the glycan types were highly determined by the differential processing of N-glycans among human and insect cells. This N-glycosylation landscape and the differential N-glycan patterns among distinct host cells are expected to shed light on the infection mechanism and present a positive view for the development of vaccines and targeted drugs.",

            "text": "low-frequency glycosylation may occur, because our integrated methods, including glycopeptide enrichment and deglycosylation, failed to improve the spectra. Apart from the canonical N-glycosylation sequons, three non-canonical motifs of N-glycosites (N164, N334, and N536) involving N-X-C sequons were not glycosylated. Before enrichment, an average of 15 N-glycosites from trypsin-digested peptides and 13 N-glycosites from Glu-C-digested peptides were assigned. In contrast, hydrophilic enrichment resulted in a significant increase of these glycosites to 18 and 16, respectively (Table S1 ). To further assess the necessity for enrichment, we compared the representative spectra of one intact N-glycopeptide (N149) before and after enrichment. Without interference from the non-glycosylated peptides, the intact N-glycopeptide had more fragmented ions assigned to N-glycosites after enrichment ( Fig. S3 ). Complementary digestion with trypsin and Glu-C promoted the confident identification of four N-glycosites (N603, N616, N709 and N717) on two intact N-glycopeptides (Table S1 and Fig. S1C ). The introduction of Glu-C digestion resulted in the production of two short intact N-glycopeptides containing 23 and 36 amino acids, respectively. These peptides are more suitable for achieving better ionization and fragmentation than the long peptide of 48 and 57 amino acids obtained from trypsin digestion (Fig. S4 ). Deglycopeptides are suitable for verifying glycosylation sites (Fig. S5) . Unexpectedly, deglycopeptide peptides led to the loss of a few glycosites, presumably because of peptide loss during deglycosylation procedures. However, almost all glycosites were confidently confirmed using trypsin and Glu-C dual digestion (Table S1 ).",

To visualize the N-glycosylation on the protein structure, all of the experimentally determined N-glycosites were hand-marked on the surface of the trimeric S protein following refinement of the recently reported SARS-CoV-2 S protein Cryo-EM structure (PDB: 6VSB) ( Based on these findings, we further analyzed the conservation of glycosites among 753 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database. After the removal of redundant sequences of the S protein at the amino acid residue level, we refined 145 S protein variants. A very low frequency of alterations in 38 residue sites was found, uniformly spanning the full length of the S protein among all S variants, except for the substitution G614D, which was identified at a relatively high frequency in 47 variants (Table S5) . However, nearly all of the 22 N-glycosylated sequons were conserved in the S protein, except for the loss of the N717 glycosite due to the T719A substitution in only one S variant.",

Surprisingly, six N-glycosites (N122, N165, N282, N331, N343, and N657) were decorated with markedly heterogeneous N-glycans of up to 139 types. The average occupancies of all glycosites presented as an overwhelming proportion (~75%) of complex N-glycans and a small proportion of hybrid (~13%) or high-mannose (~12%) N-glycans (Fig. 3F ). The glycan occupancy on two N-glycosites (N331 and N343) of RBD were identified ( Fig. 3E and 3F ). The high occupancy of RBD glycosites by various N-glycan compositions implies that N-glycosylation might be associated with the recognition of RBD to ACE2 receptor, since the interaction between RBD and ACE2 mainly depends on polar residue interactions(11). Our results suggest that S proteins expressed in different cells display distinct N-glycosylation patterns. In particular, the glycosylation of the S protein in human cells exhibits remarkable heterogeneity on N-glycosites. However, the N-glycan types on each glycosite is primarily determined by the host cells rather than the location of different glycosites ( Fig. 3E-3F, Fig. S8 ).",

The human cell-produced RBDs displayed more N-glycan compositions and complex glycan types, compared to insect cell-expressed proteins ( Fig. 4B and   4C ). Moreover, more than 80% of glycan compositions are identical at each site among different lengths of insect cell-expressed proteins (Fig. 4D) . Similarly, over 75% of the glycan compositions at each site were found to be shared by human cell-produced products (Fig. 4E ). The N-glycosylation of RBDs was verified by SDS-PAGE (Fig.S9) . These results suggest that the N-glycan compositions are conserved among different sizes of RBD proteins. Taken together, our data reveal the regular heterogeneity of N-glycan compositions at each site of the S protein subunits, primarily depending on host cells and glycosites.

Consequently, the S protein expressed in human cells displayed a larger size and a much higher proportion of complex N-glycans than that expressed in insect cells, owing to the additional elongation of the glycan backbone with multiple oligosaccharides (Fig. 3C-3F ). Our findings are in line with those of previous studies, that demonstrated the predominant complex of N-glycans attached to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV proteins (4, 5, 28) . Moreover, two recent preprint studies have revealed that the complex N-glycans dominate the glycosites on human cell-expressed SARS-CoV-2 S protein(29, 30). In contrast, S protein expression in insect cells led to a high ratio of high-mannose N-glycans ( Fig. 3C and 3E ), which has also been found in the insect cell-produced HCoV-NL63 S protein, despite expression in a different insect cell, the Drosophila S2 cell, in the previous study(15).",

Besides the direct neutralization effect, MBL, as a serum complement protein, can initiate the complement cascade. Complement hyper activation in lung tissues of COVID-19 patients has been revealed by a recent preprint study(32). However, it remains unknown whether MBL can bind to oligomannose on SARS-CoV-2 S protein to impact the viral spread or initiate complement activation in patients. Glycans also play crucial and multifaceted roles in B cell and T cell differentiation via cell-surface or secreted proteins, including selectins, galectins, and siglecs, which can further connect SARS-CoV-2 to immune response and immune regulation(27). In particular, the complex N-glycans are ligands for galectins, which are able to engage different glycoproteins to regulate immune cell infiltration and activation upon virus infection(33, 34). These mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread are worth further clarification based on a detailed analysis of clinical characteristics in humoral and cellular immunity.",

In contrast, the vaccine antigens produced from mammalian cells do not always induce a strong humoral immune response in mice, because of the complex-type N-glycans(39). To prime strong humoral immunity upon vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, insect cell-produced antigens with less complex N-glycans could be one of the candidates for the development of vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. Apart from amino acid epitopes, the glycopeptide can be presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and recognized by a CD4+T-cell population to help B cells produce antibodies against glycans. The glycoconjugate has been used to boost the immune response against infections(23, 24).",
