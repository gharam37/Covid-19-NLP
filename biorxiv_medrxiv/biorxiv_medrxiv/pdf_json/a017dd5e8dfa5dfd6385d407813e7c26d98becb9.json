Models of the spread of COVID-19 use very different lengths for this latency period, leading to very different estimates of the replication number R, even when models work from the same underlying data sets. In this paper we quantify how much varying the length of the latency period affects estimates of R, and thus the fraction of the population that is predicted to be infected in the first wave of the pandemic. This variation underscores the uncertainty in our understanding of R and raises the possibility that R may be considerably greater than has been assumed by those shaping public policy.",

While there is general agreement that some infected individuals who are not yet symptomatic (or who never develop symptoms) can still infect others (4) , there is no agreement on how long it takes an infected individual to become infectious. Some researchers treat infected individuals as immediately infectious (1, 5) , while others assume that they only become infectious towards the end of the incubation period (6) . These different assumptions lead to different trajectories for a given R 0 , with earlier infectivity usually leading to faster growth. Conversely, when estimating R 0 from an actual observed trajectory, models with earlier infectivity usually give lower estimates than models with a longer latency period. In this paper we quantify how very different those estimates can be.",

Alternatively, we can assume that the time spent in the exposed state is always exactly t 1 , and the time spent in the infectious state is exactly t 2 , but that ignores the fact that some people get sick much faster than others, while some people stay undetected and infectious for much longer than others.

Initial estimates of R 0 were based on the early stages of the epidemic in Wuhan, China, where Li et al estimated a doubling time of 7.4 days. In situations where efforts have already been made to contain the spread, the actual reproduction number R should be less than R 0 ; the goal of social distancing is to bring R below 1. However, despite public health measures, outbreaks in many places have grown much faster than in Wuhan. For instance, in the United States between March 8 and March 24, 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases grew 100-fold, from 541 to 54,856, corresponding to a doubling time of only 2.4 days (7, 8). Over the same time period, the number of confirmed cases in the entire world, excluding China, grew from 29,256 to 341,356, with a doubling time of 4.5 days; slower than the United States but faster than Wuhan. 1",
