Higher levels of angiotensin II are also proposed to be related to 128 acute lung injury [3] .

CT scan has good sensitivity and can be used to establish COVID-132 19 diagnosis in patients who are highly suspicious based on epidemiologic history and clinical 133 manifestations, but have negative PCR-based test results [16, 17] . It is important to highlight that 134 the CT scan can be normal during initial days, and a normal CT scan in a suspected case would 135 never definitely rule out the diagnosis of COVID-19 [18] . Moreover, the CT scan is dynamic in 136 patients with COVID-19 and changes rapidly [19] [20] [21] . The earliest abnormal finding in the CT 137 scan is the appearance of ground-glass opacities in peripheral and sub-pleural areas [22] . As the 138 disease progresses, the GGO's will expand and distribute more, most commonly to the right 139 lower lung lobes. Later findings include consolidations, paving patterns, thickening of lobar 140 fissures and adjacent pleura. Pleural effusion, hilar lymphadenopathies, and mediastinal 141 lymphadenopathies are not common findings and have only been reported scarcely [23] . Lung 142 pathology can progress to a \"white lung\" with low functional capacity or heal with some fibrotic 143 remnants [24] . Dynamic changes in the lungs seen on CT imaging will continue even after the 144 patient's discharge [22] . complications were acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, secondary infection, and shock that 151 lead to multiple organ failure [26, 27] . ICU patients in comparison to non-ICU patients were also 152 more likely to have complications [28] . The mortality rate was higher in critically ill patients as 153 well as in older patients with comorbidities and ARDS. Yang et al reported that the median 154 duration from ICU admission to death was 7 days [25] . The window between the presentation to 155 the time of ICU admission and/or development of ARDS is an optimal time for medical 156 intervention. 157",

ARDS was the most common reported complication and was 172 associated with poor prognosis. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries are 173 scrambling to produce enough RT-PCR diagnostic tests. Diagnostic information from other 174 surrogate markers would be valuable if markers proved to be sensitive and specific. Namely, we 175 learned that laboratory data like CRP may not only be related to the severity of disease, but it 176 may be predictive of disease outcomes. Further studies are needed to relate quantified elevations 177 in CRP to disease severity. Due to the high sensitivity of CT scan, it is considered as a good 178 diagnostic tool. However, it should be kept in mind that a normal CT scan will never rule out the 179 diagnosis of COVID-19 in a highly suspicious case based on history and clinical findings. Lastly, 180 there are different therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 patients, but we don't have enough data 181 for their efficacy.

Reported comorbidities included hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular 77 disease, and pulmonary disease. Hypertension was investigated the most, studied in 7/34 (20%) 78 of papers. Of the 16 COVID-19 positive patients found in the studies investigating hypertension, 79 8 patients were hypertensive (50%). (Table 2). Lymphopenia was reported in 10 studies which 80 identified 12/21 (57%) of COVID-19 positive patients with lymphopenia. Additionally, in 81 studies which reported C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements (44%), a large majority of 82 patients displayed an elevated CRP (73%). CT imaging was used as a diagnostic and prognostic 83 tool in 8 studies. CT images commonly displayed ground-glass opacification (GGO) patterns 84 (80%) as well as bilateral lung involvement (71.0%). Progression to acute respiratory distress 85 syndrome (ARDS) was the most common complication of patients testing positive for COVID-86 19. We found 2/34 (5.8%) reports on Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), 2 of 6 87 (33%) investigated cases had ARDS. Morality outcomes were difficult to assess; only two 88 studies showed mortality data in which 2/2 COVID-19 patients died. A wide range of therapeutic 89 modalities were tried across studies, with antiviral treatments being the most used. Common 90 antiviral treatment modalities included lopinavir (HIV protease inhibitor), arbidiol hydrochloride 91(influenza fusion inhibitor), and oseltamivir (neuraminidase inhibitor).
