Here, we examined the possible association between BCG vaccination with prevalence and mortality by COVID-19 by using publicly available data of countries/regions and the BCG World Atlas. By using linear regression modeling, we found that the number of total cases and deaths per one million population were significantly associated with the country's policy concerning BCG vaccine administration. The amount of variance in cases and deaths explained by BCG vaccination policy ranged between 12.5% and 38%. Importantly, this effect remained significant after controlling for the country's life expectancy and the average temperature in February and March 2020, which themselves are significantly correlated with the cases and deaths indices, respectively. By contrast, the ratio between deaths and cases was weakly affected. This latter outcome suggested that BCG vaccination may have hindered the overall spread of the virus or progression of the disease rather than reducing mortality rates (i.e., deaths/cases ratio). Finally, by roughly dividing countries into three categories showing high, middle, or low growth rate of the cases, we found a highly significant difference between the slope categories among the BCG groups, suggesting that the time since the onset of the spread of the virus was not a major confounding factor.",

There appears to be a large variability among countries in the risk of infection and mortality by this virus 1 . For example, Japan, which has close physical and social distance from China, is one of the first countries that recorded the first case in the earliest phase of this pandemic. As of March 30th, while many governments have 'locked-down' numerous cities and even the entire country, the Japanese government still keeps applying mild measures to mitigate the spread of the virus.

Surprisingly, despite such a liberal measure taken and relatively low number of PCR tests conducted, Japan is ranked at 117 th and 69 th among 199 countries and regions 1 , as of March 28th, regarding the number of cases per 1 million population and the number of deaths per 1 million population, respectively. Also, there seem to be visible differences in COVID-19 prevalence and mortality between countries in Western Europe and Eastern Europe. There are many potential geographical, social, and biological factors, such as temperature, humidity, life expectancy, average income, social norms, and ethnical genetic background, that could potentially explain such variabilities among countries, but it remained fully explored. In case they are successfully identified, such information could potentially contribute to the mitigation of the spread of the virus. Some vaccines (e.g., measles and Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccines) are associated with a lower risk of illness and death from other disorders [2] [3] [4] . A systematic review of epidemiological studies provided evidence for the non-specific beneficial effects of BCG vaccine on all-cause mortality 5, 6 . Induction of cytokines associated with trained immunity is proposed to underly such protection against non-related viral infections 7 . Researchers in four countries will soon start a clinical trial of BCG vaccine on this disease, based on the proposed beneficial effect of BCG 4 . Interestingly, a blogger noticed that there might be a correlation between the administration of BCG vaccine in each country and the extent to which the spread of COVID-19 occurs 8 . In this study, we evaluated the hypothesis that BCG vaccination has some protective effect against COVID-19 by utilizing publicly available datasets through linear regression modeling.

The countries that no longer recommend BCG vaccination for everyone (Group B) and those that have never had universal BCG vaccination programs (Group C) reports more cases and deaths. We have also evaluated the impact of two potentially confounding factors, the country's life expectancy and the average temperature in February and March 2020. Crucially, the effects of BCG groups on the two dependent variables remain significant, even when the country's life expectancy and temperature are controlled for. The amount of variance explained by BCG vaccination is about 12.50% and 20% for cases and deaths per one million population, respectively. The percentage of explained variance is greatly increased when only countries with a life expectancy above 78 years are considered (about 20% and 38% for cases and deaths, respectively). Also, only Group C appears to play a role in the deaths/cases ratio and explains little more than 3% of the observed variance. This latter result may suggest that, unlike cases and deaths per one million population, the death rate is weakly affected by the type of BCG vaccination policy adopted by the country. We thus hypothesize that the protective effect of the vaccine, if any, may consist of a significant reduction of the spread of the virus rather than a reduced mortality rate. It is also possible that the vaccine prevents progression of the disease after infection, since only the persons with severe symptoms tend to be able to receive PCR tests in many of the countries at present. This hypothesis requires additional empirical corroboration. Finally, in line with the results of the linear regression analysis, the Chi-squared analyses highlight that BCG vaccination policy appears to affect how quickly this virus spreads. Taken together, these results suggest that the overall impact of BCG vaccination on the COVID-19related cases and deaths is, at the very least, non-negligible and worth of further empirical investigation.",

Life expectancy is highly correlated with the income level of individuals 20 and countries 21 , which would also be related to the quality of medical care that people can receive. If life expectancy is controlled, higher income and quality of medical care may decrease the risk and mortality of diseases in general, which is expected to decrease the positive effect of life expectancy on the risks in COVID-19. Considering the highly significant contribution of life expectancy on the risks, we could consider that the income level or the quality of medical care cannot be the confounding factor that explains the association between BCG vaccination and the risks in COVID-19. Regarding the tight relationships between age and mortality in COVID-19 18, 19 , BCG protection may wane with time since vaccination 22 , and it could be potentially contributing to the higher mortality in aged populations to some extent.

The amount of unique variance -i.e., the variance explained by a certain variable by controlling for all the other variables in the model -accounted for by the BCG variables was 12.50%. The amount of unique variance accounted for by life expectancy and the country's mean temperature was 34.52% and 2.37%, respectively.Since life expectancy was the strongest predictor of cases, we reran the analyses only with those countries with a life expectancy higher than 78 (n = 45). This way,the mean life expectancy was homogeneous across BCG groups (A: 80.92\u00b12.31; B: 82.41\u00b11.27; C: 81.33\u00b12.44). The pattern of results was essentially the same. There was a statistically significant effect for both Group B (Figure 2a; b = 0.6122, p = .0024) and Group C (Figure 2a; b = 0.6511, p = .0326). The temperature had no significant effect. The amount of unique variance accounted for by the BCG variables was 19.78%. Regarding total deaths per one million population, the linear model again showed a statistically significant effect for both Group B (b = 0.7262, p = .0007) and Group C (b = 1.495, p = 7.11\u00d710 -5 ). While life expectancy was significant (Figure 1d; b = 0.4251, p = 6.20\u00d710 -6 ), the country's mean temperature was not (Figure 1b; b = -0.0761, p = .3453). The model's adjusted R 2 was .5473. The amount of unique variance accounted for by the BCG variables was 20.37%.

This time, life expectancy was not significant (b = -0.1294, p = .3019). By contrast, the country's mean temperature was significant (b = 0.2629, p = .0226). The model's adjusted R 2 was .1019. The amount of variance accounted for by the BCG variables was 3.39%.Finally, a potential issue of the above analyses is that we used data that were not corrected by the onset of the spread of the virus. We are now in the middle of the rapid development of a pandemic and the time since the onset significantly differs across different countries, which may serve as a potentially confounding factor. To address this issue, we utilized the curves of the cumulative number of confirmed cases by the number of days since 100 th case(Figure 3a), which was reported on a website 17 . Since we did not obtain the numerical data behind the figure in the website, we classified the 70 countries into three groups, that is, high (h), middle(m), and low(l) growth rate(Figure 3a; Boundary between h and m was approximately 2500 cases and the one between m and l was approximately 1400 cases at Day 15 since 100 cases; The countries in which 15 days was not reached, the value of Day 15 was estimated by projecting the growth curve to 15 th day).",

While this analysis is based on a somewhat subjective classification of the slope steepness in each country, and the number of countries assessed is only 68 here, the result indicates that the difference of the onset cannot be a major contributing factor underlying the association between COVID-19 indices and BCG vaccination. The Group B countries are heterogenous regarding 1) the years in which the vaccination started and stopped 12 and 2) the strain of the vaccine 26 . Also, in the A groups, there are differences in coverage levels among countries 27 . For example, many of A countries reside in Africa, where BCG vaccination is mostly mandatory 12 , but coverage is not necessarily high 27 , which could potentially have distorted the results. However, in this regard, analyzing those countries with a life expectancy above 78 years, which excluded most of the African countries, did not substantially affect the results. Since the initiation of the spread of COVID-19 in African countries were relatively late compared to the ones in other continents, it might be necessary to conduct similar analyses by taking the coverage rate into consideration after further spreading of the disease.",
