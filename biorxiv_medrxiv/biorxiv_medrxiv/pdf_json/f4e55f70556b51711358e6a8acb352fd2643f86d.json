However, during the course of outbreak of an infectious disease outbreak such as COVID-19, real-time estimates of CFR need to be derived carefully since it is prone to ascertainment bias and right censoring [2, 3] . In particular, the disease spectrum for COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic and mild infections to severe cases that require hospitalization and specialized supportive care. This may lead to overestimation of the CFR among ascertained cases. On the other hand, there is a delay from illness onset to death for severe cases [4] , which could lead to an underestimation of the CFR [3, 5] . Therefore, statistical methods that help mitigate inherent biases in estimates of the CFR should be employed to accurately plan for medical resources such as ICU units and ventilators, which are essential resources to save the lives of critically ill patients [6] [7] [8] .",

The CFR was as high as 38% in Madrid (38.4%), and Castilla-La Mancha areas and as low as 4% in Melilla and 8% in Galicia and Murcia. Of the 19 autonomous areas/cities, 16 had a time-delay-adjusted CFR greater than 10% reflecting a disproportionate severity burden of COVID-19 in Spain. Importantly, our estimate of CFR for the most affected Madrid region is higher than previous estimates for the most affected areas within China, Korea, and Italy. Our findings suggest a significant association of factors such as infant mortality rate and poverty risk rate with the increased risk of death due to COVID-19.",

We assume that D a,ti is the result of the binomial sampling process with probability \u03c0 a,ti . We estimated model parameters using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method in a Bayesian framework. Posterior distributions of the model parameters were estimated by sampling from the three Markov chains. For each chain, we drew 100,000 samples from the posterior distribution after a burn-in of 20,000 iterations. Convergence of MCMC chains were evaluated using the potential scale reduction statistic [24, 25]. Estimates and 95% credibility intervals for these estimates are based on the posterior probability distribution of each parameter and based on the samples drawn from the posterior distributions.",

Indeed, the elderly population is at risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 [29-31], which could partly explain the higher severity observed for Italy and Spain. Other factors that could have played a role in these differences may be related to differences in the definition of COVID-19 death, and differences in testing strategies. For example, in Korea extensive testing and rigorous contact tracing strategy were implemented [32] while testing prioritized more severe cases in Italy [31] and Spain [33].",
