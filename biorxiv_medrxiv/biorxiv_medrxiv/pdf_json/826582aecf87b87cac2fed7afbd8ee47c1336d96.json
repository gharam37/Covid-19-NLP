The effectiveness of social distancing policies requires significant engagement from communities. However, communities may face barriers to successfully adhere to these policies depending on prevailing socioeconomic conditions and political beliefs. 3 This study examines the socioeconomic and political determinants of engagement in social distancing among U.S. counties.",
