ACE2 is a carboxy metalloprotease that, among its other substrates, cleaves angiotensin I (angiotensin 1-10) and angiotensin II (angiotensin 1-8), respectively, to angiotensin (1-9) and angiotensin (1-7). In doing so it counteracts the vasoconstrictive activity of ACE1 (Hamming et al., 2007; Jia, 2016) . Although the catalytic domains of ACE1 and ACE2 are similar, ACE1 inhibitors have no effect on the enzymatic activity ACE2. Moreover, the proteolytic activity of ACE2 does not contribute to SARS-CoV-1 or, presumably, SARS-CoV-2 entry processes (Li et al., 2003) . However interference with ACE2 activity, through S-protein-promoted internalization and degradation, triggered release by cellular proteases, or loss of ACE2-expressing type II pneumocytes, may contribute to SARS and COVID-19 pathology. Although the physiologic role of ACE2 is complex, its activity is described as protective against acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by many agents (Imai et al., 2007) . However administration of soluble recombinant ACE2, although well tolerated, did not attenuate acute lung injury in an early clinical study of ARDS unrelated to COVID-19 (Khan et al., 2017) .",

The coronavirus S protein is a type I viral entry protein similar to influenza hemagglutinin and the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein ( Figure 1A and 1B) (Li, 2016) . Like these latter entry proteins, the S protein is processed into two domains, S1 and S2 (Walls et al., 2020) . S1 binds ACE2, whereas S2 anchors the S protein to the viral membrane. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein has an efficient furin cleavage site at its S1/S2 boundary, and this site is processed in virus-producing cells (Coutard et al., 2020) . In contrast, the SARS-CoV-1 S1/S2 junction is cleaved by extracellular or target-cell proteases including TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L (Glowacka et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2006; Millet and Whittaker, 2015) . Both S proteins require processing at a second site, S2', within the S2 domain to mediate fusion of the viral and target cell membranes (Belouzard et al., 2009 ).",

These RBDs are structurally and functionally distinct from the remainder of the S1 domain, and express and fold as independent domains (Wong et al., 2004) . Both RBDs are highly stable and held together by four disulfide bonds. Structural studies of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound to ACE2 have identified a variable region, termed the receptor-binding motif (RBM), which directly engages ACE2 (Li et al., 2005) . This region is divergent between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 1D ) although both RBD bind ACE2 in the same orientation and rely on conserved, mostly aromatic, residues to engage this receptor. The divergence between the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBM domains suggest that this region is subject to ongoing positive selection from the humoral response in various hosts. Despite this divergence, some antibodies, notably CR3022, bind both RBD domains (Tian et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Because the S protein is the dominant protein exposed on the virion, and because its activity can be impeded with antibodies, it is likely the major target of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Soluble trimeric S proteins, including those stabilized through various mechanisms, have been tested as SARS-CoV-1 vaccines, and similar approaches are now being taken against SARS-CoV-2 (Chen et al., 2005; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) . Another approach, immunizing with the RBD alone, has been shown to raise potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 in rodents (He et al., 2006; He et al., 2004) . Although the RBD presents fewer epitopes than the S-protein trimer, this approach may have key advantages. The RBD is easier to produce, and is less likely to elicit antibodies against poorly neutralizing but more immunogenic epitopes. In addition, antibodydependent enhancement (ADE) contributes to the pathogenicity of feline coronaviruses (Huisman et al., 2009; Olsen et al., 1992; Weiss and Scott, 1981) , and has been raised as a concern for vaccines against SARS-CoV-1 (Jaume et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2019; Luo et al., 2018; Wan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2005; Yip et al., 2016) 3. ADE contributes to the pathology of other viral diseases, notably those caused by flaviviruses, and in those cases, non-neutralizing antibodies promote more efficient ADE than those which also neutralize (Dejnirattisai et al., 2010; Halstead and O'Rourke, 1977; Takada and Kawaoka, 2003) . Thus the RBD-elicited antibodies may mediate ADE less efficiently than those recognizing other S-protein epitopes because they are more likely to be neutralizing.",

Serial dilutions of day-0 and day-40 sera were measured for their ability to neutralize retroviruses pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (SARS2-PV). To provide a consistent metric for neutralization potency, these sera were also compared with a mixture of all four day-0 preimmune sera, further combined with an immunoadhesin form of ACE2 (ACE2-Ig) at concentrations in sera of 10, 100, and 1000 \u00b5g/ml before dilution. As anticipated, some baseline inhibition could be observed in heat-inactivated rat sera (grey lines in Figure 2A ). However day-40 serum from each rat, obtained after two sets of immunizations, potently neutralized SARS2-PV entry with an efficiency comparable to or greater than day-0 presera mixed with ACE2-Ig at a 100 \u00b5g/ml concentration ( Figure 2A and 2B). Indeed day-40 serum from one of four rats, R16, neutralized as efficiently as 1 mg/ml of ACE2-Ig mixed into preimmune serum. For context, the concentration of IgG in rat serum in approximately 12-14 mg/ml (Medesan et al., 1998) . ACE2-Ig itself, in the context of rat presera, appears to have an IC50 of well under 1 \u00b5g/ml (10 nM), as a 1620-fold dilution of 1000 \u00b5g/ml ACE2 in preimmune sera neutralized more than 50% of SARS2-PV entry ( Figure 2B ). This ACE2-Ig inhibition is greater than what we observed with SARS-CoV-1 (Moore et al., 2004) , consistent with ACE2's higher affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) .

Again day-40 serum potently neutralized S-protein-mediated entry, with significantly greater efficiency than day-0 serum mixed with 100 \u00b5g/ml ACE2-Ig. At lower dilutions (1:20 and 1:60) day-15 serum neutralized more efficiently than day-0 serum, somewhere between 10 and 100 \u00b5g/ml ACE2 in preserum. However day-40 serum did not efficiently neutralize retroviruses pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-1 S protein (SARS1-PV), except at the lowest (1:20) dilution, excluding the possibility that immunization with a single RBD could protect against SARS-like viruses with divergent RBD. Finally, to confirm that sera from vaccinated rats neutralized SARS2-PV by recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we used each pooled serum to displace an ACE2-Ig variant with a rabbit Fc (ACE2-rIg) domain from cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein ( Figure 2D ). The ability of each pooled serum to displace ACE2-rIg correlated with its ability to neutralize SARS2-PV. Specifically, day-40 sera displaced ACE2-rIg more efficiently than preimmune sera containing 100 \u00b5g/ml ACE2-Ig, and day-15 sera displaced ACE2-rIg more efficiently than preimmune sera containing 10 \u00b5g/ml ACE2-Ig. Thus immunization with SARS-CoV-2 RBD elicits antibodies that potently neutralize S-protein mediated entry by directly binding the S protein.",

This undesirable antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has been well characterized in tissue-culture studies of several flaviviruses including Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (Shim et al., 2019) . To evaluate this possibility for SARS-CoV-2, SARS2-PV were mixed with pooled day-0 or day-40 serum at the indicated serial dilutions, and the resulting virus/sera mixtures were incubated with HEK293T cells transfected to express rat Fc\u03b3RI. These cells did not express ACE2 and no infection was observed with day-0 preimmune sera nor day-40 immune sera ( Figure 3A ). To verify that these cells were capable of mediating ADE, rat anti-ZIKV antisera generated by two different rats and pooled, or day-0 preimmune sera was incubated at the same dilutions with ZIKV virus-like particles (VLP). In contrast to the absence of effect of day-40 anti-RBD anti-sera on SARS2-PV, anti-ZIKV antisera at the same concentrations promoted robust ADE ( Figure 3B ). ADE activity peaked at approximately a 1/2000 dilution, consistent with competition between ADE and neutralizing activities of these antisera.",

It is at this moment unclear whether these S-protein trimers, RBDs, or some parallel or serial combination thereof, will make better antigens. Recent studies suggest that neutralization activity of patient sera correlates with its RBD recognition, and that most neutralizing antibodies bind the RBD (To et al., 2020). It is possible that the remainder of the S protein presents non-neutralizing epitopes that are more immunogenic than the RBD, and thus the RBD by itself may elicit antisera that are more neutralizing. However, other antibody effector functions, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement fixation, are more efficiently activated when multiple antibodies bind their target simultaneously, and these non-neutralizing activities can play important roles in viral control. If these activities contribute significantly to SARS-CoV-2 prevention, the S-protein trimer may make a better antigen than the RBD.

ADE is more obvious in feline coronavirus, where it results in a shift in tropism and increase in disease severity (Huisman et al., 1998; Huisman et al., 2009; Weiss and Scott, 1981) . Although ADE could theoretically be mediated by multiple mechanisms, the standard paradigm is provided by flaviviruses, most notably by dengue virus (Takada and Kawaoka, 2003) . It is well appreciated that a second dengue virus infection with a different serotype can result in a hemorrhagic fever. In addition, a dengue-virus vaccine was reported to increase hospitalizations of vaccinees after their first dengue-virus exposure (Flipse and Smit, 2015; Tsai et al., 2017) . In both cases, the underlying mechanism is presumed to be enhanced Fc-receptor-mediated internalization of virions bound to antibodies.",

In the case of neutralizing antibodies, ADE is a consequence of insufficient coating of the virion surface, due to lower affinity or concentration of the antibody. If concentrations or affinity is raised, neutralization dominates. In contrast, ADE mediated by nonneutralizing antibodies increases with increasing concentration. We therefore speculated that it would be difficult of observe ADE with rat antisera targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, a key neutralizing epitope. Indeed, although rat anti-Zika virus antisera mediated robust ADE of ZIKV in two different Fc receptor-expressing cell lines, no ADE of S-protein pseudoviruses was observed with anti-RBD anti-sera, whether or not the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 was present.",

We immunized rats with an adjuvant system (AS01) already in human use, notably for vaccines for shingles (Shingrix TM ) and malaria (Mosquirix TM ). The RBD used here was conjugated to a carrier protein, Keyhole limpet hemocyanin, proven safe over decades in humans (Swaminathan et al., 2014) . However KLH can be problematic for those with shellfish allergies, and alternate scaffolds for presenting the RBD may be necessary. Rats were immunized with two sets of escalating inoculations, each administered over seven days. This strategy has been shown to maximize immune responses against HIV-1 antigens (Tam et al., 2016), but it may not be a practical means of addressing the current pandemic with a subunit vaccine. That said, the escalating dosage strategy used here may more accurately reflect the kinetics of an mRNA-delivered vaccine, and indeed we would argue that an RBD antigen would be a preferable alternative, or at least a useful complement, to mRNA expression of the S-protein trimer.",

A key point relevant to this question is that the neutralizing activity elicited in these studies is likely much greater than would be necessary to prevent a new SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rat antisera on average neutralized more efficiently than naive sera bearing 100 \u00b5g/ml of ACE2-Ig, which itself neutralizes with an IC50 of less than 1 \u00b5g/ml, consistent with its activity against infectious SARS-CoV-1 (Moore et al., 2004) . To provide some context for these numbers, eCD4-Ig, an immunoadhesin that emulates HIV-1 viral receptors and neutralizes with neutralization potency similar to that of ACE2-Ig, affords robust protection against high-dose intravenous challenges with an HIV-1-like virus when it is present in serum in the range of 5-10 \u00b5g/ml (Gardner et al., 2019; Gardner et al., 2015) . Thus it is possible that a less robust response could still be protective. Perhaps as important as these quantitative considerations, our data show that the RBD alone is sufficient to elicit a potent neutralizing antibody response. It remains to be determined whether trimer-based vaccines, or trimer/RBD combinations, can be more effective, and whether they carry additional safety concerns.",

Briefly, HEK293T cells were cotransfected by PEI with three plasmids, pMLV-gag-pol, pCAGGS-VSV-G and pQCXIP-myc-hACE2-c9 at a ratio of 3:2:1, and medium was refreshed after overnight incubation of transfection mix. The supernatant with produced virus was harvested 72-hours post transfection and clarified by passing through 0.45\u03bcm filter. 293T-hACE2 cells were selected and maintained with medium containing puromycin (Sigma). hACE2 expression was confirmed by SARS1-PV and SARS2-PV entry assays and by immunofluorescence staining using mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing c-Myc.",
