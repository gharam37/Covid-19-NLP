Method We verified in a consecutive series of 191 symptomatic patients the clinical information that new rapid serological colorimetric test qualitatively analyzing IgM/IgG expression can provide with respect to standard assay and with respect to clinical outcome of patients. ResultsRapid serological test showed a sensitivity of 30% and a specificity of 89% with respect to the standard assay but, interestingly, these performances improve after 8 days of symptoms appearance. After 10 days of symptoms the predictive value of rapid serological test is higher than that of standardassay. When the behaviour of the two immunoglobulins was evaluated with respect to time length of symptoms appaerance, no significant difference in immunoglobulins behaviour was shown.",

However, this assay has some practical limitations (3)such as the annoying method to obtain biological material from the nasopharynx, the relatively long time to generate results, the need for certified laboratories and specific expertise. These limitations make RT-PCR unsuitable for a quick and simple patient screening and therefore, the search for a precise, rapid and simple test to quickly identify SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in a large scale screening has become urgent to prevent virus transmission and to ensure timely treatment of patients. The Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health of the National University of Singapore (https://sph.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID-19-Science-Report-Diagnostics-13-Mar.pdf) recently reviewed the diagnostic test for COVID-19 infection currently undergoing clinical validation by listing dozens of assays based on RT-PcR, RealtimePcR, NGS, Microfluidics. Twelve immunoassays based on the evidence of COVID-19 related IgG andIgMwere also listed. This latter experimental attempt, based on previous experiences with epidemic viral SARS infection, argued that IgM specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody could be detected in the blood after 3-6 days while IgGsome days later (4).

Notably, only 43% of the patients that were COVID-19-positive with the molecular test were also positive with serological test. This figure is impressively similar to the performances reported for serological tests in Spain (11) and Germany (12). However, the first important information from our study concerns the 12% of cases that tested negative with molecular test but had positive serological results. The two tests do not produce similar results as would be obvious for assays that look at different aspects of Covid-19; in fact, the molecular test demonstrates the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in samples from specific anatomical parts of the respiratory system while the kinetics of immunoglobulinsis devoted to describe as the body reacts to the viral infection. Negative serological test results in patients with a positive molecular test could mean that the latter are infected subjects that have not yet reached the stage of developing an immunoglobulin reaction; conversely, subjects whose serological tests show the presence of specific IgG and/or IgM antibodies and have negative molecular tests, may be considered as recovering from COVID-19. The data shown in Figure 1 seem to confirm these assumptions as the molecular test yielded more positive results in early symptomatic phases of the disease while the serological test performed better in the late phases of the disease (i.e. 10 days after symptom appearance).",

Firstly, the Viva-Diag TM test is based on a colorimetric evaluation of the IgG and IgM bands by the operator thus implying all the limitations that a qualitative inter-intra-operator evaluation produce in terms of variability (15) . In our study, this aspect was partially solved by resorting to double operator evaluation and taking picture of all test results to be re-analyzed by a third party in the case of first level evaluation disagreement. However, in this regard, our next step of research to overcome the issues met,will be to use quantitative immunoenzymatic methods to analyze SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulins (16) . A further limitation of our study regarded the fact that the neutralizing antibodies used in the Viva-diag TM test might cross-react with other corona-virus antigens, like those of the SARS-CoV. The recombinant antigen utilized in Viva-Diagis the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for which information on possible cross-reactivity with other corona and flu viruses has not yet been studied (9) .
