            "text": "Targeted immunization or attacks of large-scale networks has attracted significant attention by the scientific community. However, in real-world scenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited thereby precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or remove) in order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of current COVID-19 epidemic. Here, we study a novel immunization strategy where only n nodes are observed at a time and the most central between these n nodes is immunized (or attacked). This process is continued repeatedly until 1 \u2212 p fraction of nodes are immunized (or attacked). We develop an analytical framework for this approach and determine the critical percolation threshold pc and the size of the giant component P\u221e for networks with arbitrary degree distributions P (k). In the limit of n \u2192 \u221e we recover prior work on targeted attack, whereas for n = 1 we recover the known case of random failure. Between these two extremes, we observe that as n increases, pc increases quickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization (attack) with complete information. In particular, we find a new scaling relationship between |pc(\u221e) \u2212 pc(n)| and n as |pc(\u221e) \u2212 pc(n)| \u223c n \u22121 exp(\u2212\u03b1n). For Scale-free (SF) networks, where P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 , 2 < \u03b3 < 3, we find that pc has a transition from zero to non-zero when n increases from n = 1 to order of log N (N is the size of network). Thus, for SF networks, knowledge of order of log N nodes and immunizing them can reduce dramatically an epidemics.",

Connectivity of components is critical for maintaining the functioning of infrastructures like the internet [9] and transportation networks [10] , as well as for understanding immunization against epidemics [11] and the spread of information in social systems [12] . Due to this importance, researchers have long focused on how a network can be optimally immunized or fragmented to prevent epidemics or to maintain infrastructure resilience [3, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Many approaches have used percolation theory from statistical physics to prevent the spread of virus or assess network resilience under the infection or failure of some fraction of nodes or links [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .",

At the same time, if these hub nodes, largest degree nodes, are targeted, the network can reach immunity [29, 31, 32] . However, these previous models of targeted immunization have assumed full knowledge of the network structure which in many cases is not available. Recent research has shown that even those in control of a network often have knowledge only of a small part of the whole network structure [33] [34] [35] .

We assume that at each stage, a number n nodes are observed and the node with highest degree is immunized and thus unable to continue spreading infection. This procedure is repeated until 1 \u2212 p fraction of nodes are immunized. In particular, our model could apply to a situation where several cooperative teams are sent to immunize a network and each team has access to information on a small subset (n nodes) of the network. We develop a theoretical framework for this model of immunization with limited information using percolation theory for networks with arbitrary degree distribution. In the limit of n = N we recover prior work on targeted attack [32] , whereas for n = 1 we recover the case of random failure [30, 31] . We observe excellent agreement between our theoretical and simulation results for the n dependence of the critical threshold p c and the size of the giant component P \u221e for p > p c . The giant component and p c characterize the efficiency of the immunization. The smaller is the giant component, the immunization strategy is better. The larger is p c the immunization is more efficient since less immunization doses are needed to stop the epidemics. We find an analytical relationship between n and p c for both Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) and Scale-Free (SF) networks. Surprisingly, we also find that p c quickly reaches a plateau even for relatively small n, after which increasing n has negligible effect on p c . This means that immunization with small n (not knowing the whole structure) can dramatically improve the immunization.",

Similar to ER networks, the size of the giant component, P \u221e can be obtained from Eq. (9). Fig. 3(a) , shows P \u221e as a function of 1 \u2212 p for different n values. The results demonstrate that SF networks become more immunized/vulnerable compared to ER networks under the immunization/attack as n increases. Compared with ER networks, one can observe that slightly higher values of n (more knowledge) are needed to reach the near-steady-state region of fully targeted strategy. For SF networks with 2 < \u03b3 < 3, under random immunization/attack (n = 1), it has been shown that p c = 0 for an infinite system [30] , while for high-degree immunization/attack (n \u2192 \u221e), p c > 0 [31, 32] . Next we wish to find out for which n, p c becomes non-zero, and how it depends on the system size N . To this end, we analyze Eqs. (5) and (10) for large k (high degrees govern the behavior in SF), small n and p as follows (elaborated in SM).",

Also for n = 5, we can see that system size matters and p c decreases as N increases. Fig. 4(b) shows that the scaling with n/ log N of Eq. (14) is valid. Furthermore, it is seen in Fig. 4 (b) that when n is small or N is large, such that n/ log N 1 (in Fig. 4 it is 0.07), p c approaches 0.

Especially in cases of global pandemics such as e.g., the current COVID-19, it is impossible to know the full interactions of all individuals. Thus an effective way to limit spreading is obtaining information on a few (n) individuals and targeting the most central of these. For example, testers could stand at a supermarket and select a group of people entering the store simultaneously. Information on the connections of these people e.g., the number of people they live with, where and how often they meet with other people etc. could be quickly obtained (such as through cell phone tracking) and then the individual with the most connections in the group could be quarantined or immunized. Our results demonstrate that even when this is done in small groups of people (low n), it is possible to obtain a significant improvement in global immunization compared to randomly selecting individuals. In our model, this was seen by the reduced size of the giant component and the large critical threshold p c . Overall, these findings could help to develop better ways for immunizing large networks and designing resilient infrastructure.",

            "text": "How pc for SF networks depends on \u03b3 and the system size N . (a) pc as a function of \u03b3 for different values of n and N . pc decreases with increasing N . For n = 1 and 2 < \u03b3 < 3, it is well-known that pc approaches zero for infinite system. (b) pc as a function of n/ log N for SF network with \u03b3 = 2.1. The enlarged figure for small n = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 5 are shown in the inset, and pc approaches zero for n/ log N 1. (c) The scaling of pc with N and n for large N and small n. Here C(n) is the pre-factor. The minimum and maximum degree of nodes are m = 2 and K = N 1/(\u03b3\u22121) respectively. This confirms Eq.(14) for \u03b3 = 2.1, and \u03b4 = (3 \u2212 \u03b3)/2 = 0.45.",
