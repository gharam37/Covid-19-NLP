We find that variations in the time dimension and intensity of various strategies can have vastly different performance outcomes: (i) the timing of NPIs can 'shrink the area under the curve' (cumulative infections) not just 'flatten the curve'; (ii) prolonged lockdowns have diminishing margins of returns; (iii) smooth, submaximal lockdowns perform better than pulsatile lockdowns; and (iv) the efficiency of various strategies incorporating both epidemiological and non-epidemiological outcomes vary substantially. Most sobering, none of the simulated strategies allow for an 'acceptable' path to exit within six months due to very large gaps in health system capacity.",

As COVID-19 cases moderate where lockdowns are in place, there is debate about how these lockdowns can be withdrawn but inadequate evidence on the performance of various NPI exit strategies to inform these. Epidemiological considerations are critical but given the impact of NPIs on livelihoods and economies, both epidemiological outcomes and non-epidemiological outcomes will need to be considered in the performance of NPIs. This is the critical gap in evidence that this paper aspires to contribute towards by using a modeling platform to simulate 100 different scenarios on a hypothetical population whereby time-variant parameters related to lockdown interventions are modified individually to draw generalizable insights and highlight further knowledge and analytic gaps. Performance measures are collected during the simulation to generate evidence for and against different strategies. NPIs are inextricably linked to exit strategies and hence all simulations are run for an additional 6 months to achieve steady state so that the whole strategy until the endgame can be measured.",

Societies are hence faced with a difficult choice between two broad paths. The first path is to strongly suppress the outbreak and eliminate local transmission, leaving the population relatively unravaged by COVID-19 and its associated morbidity and mortality, but fully susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. NPI measures required to attain and preserve this paradigm are substantive and are not short term. They will have major implications on society, the economy, and other aspects of health such as mental health and emergency management of noncommunicable diseases. If a proven and accessible vaccine then becomes available, population herd immunity can be developed through immunization rather than infection. This first path is not the focus of this paper as an exit from NPI is antithetical. The second path leads to a population which is no longer susceptible to SARS-CoV2 through the attainment of herd immunity by infection, implying that a large proportion of the population will be exposed to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality on-route to this destination. The goal of NPIs in this context is to keep the burden of COVID-19 cases within the capacity of the health system. However, not all NPIs are created equal in terms of performance against epidemiological outcomes measures and non-epidemiological outcomes, as explored through simulations in this paper.",

B-series scenarios are presented primarily as charts ( Figure 3 ). Prevalence charts for all scenarios are available on online. 5 Baseline scenario. The baseline scenario devoid of any NPI simulated has a peak prevalence of 231 per 1,000 on Day 60 and a peak incidence of 16.9 per 1,000 on Day 47. A total of 3.1 deaths per 1,000 are simulated by Day 365, excluding excess deaths resulting from an overwhelmed health system, as 88.5 percent of the initial population is infected in this fast spreading outbreak. The overcapacity factor is 7,757, the highest of all scenarios, reflecting an unmitigated surge in COVID-19 cases overwhelming the health system. However, proxy measures of economic and social activity are not reduced by any NPIs and hence, in reflection of business-as-usual, are the highest of all scenarios at 840 cumulative 'acts' per person over the intervention period from Day 14 to 182. Timing of introduction. The performance of B-series simulations varies by the day the fixedduration lockdown is introduced (Figure 2 and Figure 3 ) and demonstrates clearly how bimodal peaks in prevalence can be created by a once-off lockdown. Very early introduction of the lockdown merely delays the outbreak until after the lockdown but a lockdown introduced a bit later (B24) reduces peak prevalence to 157 per 1,000 compared to the baseline as a substantial number of cases occur around the introduction of and during the lockdown in a relatively moderated manner. Late introduction of the lockdown (B47) performs poorly in outcomes such as reducing or delaying peak prevalence but performs well in reducing the final tally of the infected to just 77.2 percent of the initial population. The best performance in terms of reducing peak prevalence is seen when the lockdown is timed to result in roughly equally high bimodal peaks, at a critical tipping point such that just one day's difference in timing the lockdown results in the highest peak flipping from occurring after the lockdown on Day 122 (B33) to occurring one day after the lockdown is introduced Day 35 (B34).

For NPIs which are implemented strongly, under the parameter estimates used for this hypothetical population, these would represent lockdowns with an intensity of 80% to 100% (see Figure 7 Scenario E2), the NPI suppresses the outbreak during the intervention period but to an extent that prevents the population from attaining herd immunity. Hence, when lifted, the outbreak peaks rapidly. Weak lockdowns with an intensity of 50% or below do not suppress the outbreak and permit a peak even during the period of lockdown. An unstable equilibrium (E3), exists where the right amount of suppression can flatten out the prevalence curve very well over several months. At the end of the intervention, the right balance of immunity within the community and remaining infections fester at a low intensity for a few months more before dissipating without any further NPIs. Importantly, this 'sweet spot' is only relevant for the parameter estimates used, the population characteristics, the stage of the outbreak at which the lockdown was started and the duration of this simulated partial lockdown (168 days from Day 14). The scenario conditions for E3 are not a general rule-of-thumb which can be applied to other populations. Scenario E5 is an important comparator against D-series scenarios as the reduction in 'acts' is the same as pulsatile scenarios with a 50% duty cycle (i.e., D1e to D6). Peak prevalence and incidence for Scenario E5 are lower than for any of these D-series comparators.",

In all scenarios simulated 6 , the percentage of the initial population infected by Day 365, at which steady state without prior elimination of infections and without NPIs has been reached (analogous to herd immunity), is high but varies widely by scenario. In the baseline scenario, this percentage is the highest at 89.0 percent. In the most optimal scenario simulated for reducing cumulative infections (Figure 7 Scenario E4) this was 17.9 percentage points lower. Applied on a global scale, this corresponds to sparing 1.4 billion people from the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 infection. B-series scenarios indicate that NPIs not only flatten the curve to avoid overwhelming health system capacity but shrink the area under the curve especially when applied towards the end of the outbreak. This insight is relevant even for countries which may have missed instituting NPI measures early as a final punch of NPIs to prevent overshoot, even after cases has peaked, will likely reduce mortality and morbidity independently of the effect of keeping the burden of COVID-19 cases within health system capacity.",

Under the epidemiological parameters and population characteristics simulated for this hypothetical population, none of the C-series 'smash-the-mountain' strategies were able to eradicate COVID-19 fully, even in this closed population of 100,000. The technical strength of the stochastic ICM model used for these simulations, compared to deterministic compartment models, is that full eradication is a possible outcome as individuals are modelled discretely. Unless a vaccine is expected, a prolonged lockdown with an intensity much greater than that required to keep COVID-19 cases within health system capacity, but which is not able to eliminate the infection, is of unclear value.

Further analysis would be required to identify the appropriate triggers from empirical surveillance findings on the ground to inform calibration during the intervention.

The highest performing model flattens the curve substantially from a peak prevalence of 231 per 1,000 in the baseline scenario to 52 per 1,000 (Figure 7 Scenario E3) with six months of intervention but will still overwhelm the health system capacity by an order of magnitude or more for the 6 months of the intervention followed by 6 months for the outbreak to dissipate on its own.
