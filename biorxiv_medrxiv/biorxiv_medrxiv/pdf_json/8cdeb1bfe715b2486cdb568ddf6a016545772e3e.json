Evidence based recommendations for specialities such as gastroenterology, gastrointestinal endoscopy and gastrointestinal surgery are required where there may be an exposure risk to virus shed in faeces. Despite viral RNA being detected in the air or other surface samples like toilets, it is still unclear whether it is viable to transmit infection through this route. 5 The primary aim of this review is to assess the incidence of COVID-19 patients positive on testing of faecal samples for the virus and the timing with respect to the clinical course (onset of symptoms) when faecal tests may be positive. Our secondary aims are to establish the incidence of patients with positive faecal samples after negative respiratory swabs and any evidence to suggest faecal virus transmitted infection.",

The number of participants recruited in the studies ranged from 1 to 206 with ages ranging from 3 months to 87 years. Sample collection consisted of either faecal samples, anal or rectal swabs. Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was the test performed on all samples to detect viral RNA. The indication for faecal testing was not specified in most studies. In some the test was done in asymptomatic patients for screening after contact with an infected person or travel history to an infected area. The predominant symptoms of presentation in the studies were persistent cough, fever and breathlessness with fewer patients reporting diarrhoea or vomiting. All studies had information regarding our primary aim of reporting faecal samples for the virus in those with COVID-19. Of these, 16 7,10,11,14-19,23,24,26-30 provided information on the duration of these tests after symptom onset and evidence of positive faecal samples after symptom recovery, discharge from the hospital or negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR. A total of 824 patients were included across the studies and 540 were tested for faecal viral RNA. Positive faecal RT-PCR tests occurred in 291 (53\u00b79%). The timing of the first positive sample was available in 21 studies and varied from day 0 of symptom onset to day 17. Late positive tests do not necessarily equate to absence of the virus earlier in the illness but may likely reflect the heterogeneity in testing patterns amongst the studies. First stool samples were often reported late after hospital admission 11 or even after discharge 28 while some were analysed from day 1 of hospitalisation or symptom onset 19, 20, 27, 29, 32 .

This may have important implications regarding measures to prevent the spread of the disease, especially for precautions recommended for the public, protective equipment for health professionals involved in procedures and interventions involving the gastrointestinal tract. Similar patterns of virus isolation from stool and faeco-oral transmission were observed for other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-1. 33 Bio-aerosol generation of viral particles as a result of flushing of toilets as well as the impact of disinfection on these have also been studied before 34, 35 along with the persistence of coronaviruses on surfaces. 36 The risk to health care professionals from patient exposure is well known, specifically in high aerosol generating procedures. Professional societies and investigator groups from countries with experience of managing COVID 19 in the context of gastrointestinal interventions 38, 39 highlight the risk to individuals in endoscopy departments and the need for necessary precautions including negative pressure rooms and personal protective equipment. This review supports the importance of these measures given the relatively high prevalence and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in faeces. Isolation of live virus is confirmed by one study 25 but the proportion of cases that might be transmitted by this route is unclear due to the heterogeneity in case selection and lack of standardisation of study designs and protocols. Areas such as Care homes may be particularly vulnerable to transmission of infection by this route and recommendations must take into account this evidence to ensure the protection of health and social care providers and the general public in the meantime.",
