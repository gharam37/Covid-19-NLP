Surveyed SARS models varied in the terms of population studied and geographical characteristics. 6, 7 Different designs were used for SARS modeling consisting of deterministic compartmental models 7 , stochastic compartmental models 6 , a combination of stochastic and deterministic compartmental models 8 , discrete-time models 9 , logistics curve fitting models 10 , contact network models 11 and likelihood-based models. 12 Studies associated with risk factors for SARS 13 and MERS 3,14-20 have found an association between comorbidities and infected cases.",

This is particularly important since previous studies have shown that there is considerable heterogeneity in space, transmissibility and susceptibility. 5 Our approach is developed at county level with inclusion of a variety of health statistics, demographics and geographical features of counties. Further, we use publicly available data so that any organization could use the model.

The null hypothesis -the 10% least vulnerable counties would have the same proportion of rural counties as the actual proportion of rural counties in the dataset -was rejected for every day from March 14 th to March 26 th . Additionally, the null hypothesis -the actual positive instances counties would the same proportion of urban counties as the actual proportion of urban counties in the dataset -was also rejected for every day over the analysis period. It can therefore be concluded that there is a positive association between urban and most vulnerable counties as well as rural and least vulnerable counties.
