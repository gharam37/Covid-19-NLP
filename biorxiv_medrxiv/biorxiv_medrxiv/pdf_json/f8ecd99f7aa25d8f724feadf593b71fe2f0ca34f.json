Previous studies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mainly described the general epidemiological, clinical, and radiological features of patients with confirmed infection (1) . Little attention has been paid to the clinical characteristics and outcomes of intensive care patients with COVID-19, data of which are scarce but are of paramount importance to reduce mortality. We aimed to bridge the gap between disease classification and clinical outcome in intensive care patients, which could help in individual evaluation and provide effective triage for treatment and management. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",
