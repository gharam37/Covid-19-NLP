In the large coronavirus family, comprising enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh encountered strain that causes respiratory disease in humans (3) ranging from mild --the common cold --to severe --the zoonotic Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). As of April 2020, there are over one million presumed or confirmed cases of coronavirus disease worldwide, with total deaths exceeding 50,000 (4) . While age and many comorbidities, including cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, appear to increase the severity and mortality of COVID-19 (5-10) , approximately 80% of infected individuals have mild symptoms (11) . As with SARS-CoV (12, 13) and MERS-CoV (14, 15) , children seem to have low susceptibility to the disease (16) (17) (18) ; despite similar infection rates as adults (19) only 5.9% of pediatric cases are severe or critical, possibly due to lower binding ability of the ACE2 receptor in children or generally higher levels of antiviral antibodies (20) . Other similarities (21-23) including genomic (24, 25) and immune system response (26-34) between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (35) , especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are topics of ongoing active research, results of which may inform an understanding of the severity of infection (36) and improve the ongoing work of immune landscape profiling (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) and vaccine discovery (29, 38, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] .",

For instance, disease caused by the closely-related SARS-CoV (24, 25) shows increased severity among individuals with the HLA-B*46:01 genotype (1) . Associations between HLA genotype and disease severity extend broadly to several other unrelated viruses. For example, in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), certain HLA types (e.g. HLA-A*02:05) may reduce risk of seroconversion (50) , and in dengue virus, certain HLA alleles (e.g. HLA-A*02:07, HLA-B*51) are associated with increased secondary disease severity among ethnic Thais (51) .",

After aligning reference proteome sequence data for 5 essential viral components (ORF1ab, S, E, M, and N proteins) across 34 distinct alpha-and betacoronaviruses , including all known human coronaviruses, we identified 48 highly conserved amino acid sequence spans (Appendix 1). Acknowledging the challenges inferring cross-protective immunity among closely related peptides, we confined attention exclusively to identical peptide matches. Among conserved sequences, 44 SARS-CoV-2 sequences would each be anticipated to generate at least one 8-to 12-mer linear peptide epitope also present within at least one other common human coronavirus (Supplementary Table S2, Figure 2 ). In total, 564 such 8-to 12-mer peptides were found to share 100% identity with corresponding OC43, HKU1, NL63, and 229E sequences (467, 460, 179, and 157 peptides, respectively) (Supplementary Table S3 ). For the subset of these potentially cross-protective peptides that are anticipated to be generated via the MHC class I antigen processing pathway, we performed binding affinity predictions across 145 different HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles. As above, we demonstrate the SARS-CoV-2-specific distribution of per-allele presentation for these conserved peptides. We found that alleles HLA-A*02:02, HLA-B*15:03, and HLA-C*12:03 were the top presenters of conserved peptides. Conversely, we note that 56 different HLA alleles demonstrated no appreciable binding affinity (<500nM) to any of the conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides, suggesting a concomitant lack of potential for cross-protective immunity from other human coronaviruses. We note, in particular, HLA-B*46:01 is among these alleles. Note also that the putative capacity for conserved peptide presentation is unrelated to the HLA allelic frequency in the population ( Figure 3 ). Moreover, we see no appreciable global correlation between conservation of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and its predicted MHC binding affinity, suggesting a lack of selective pressure for or against the capacity to present coronavirus epitopes (p=0.27 [Fisher's exact test], Supplementary Figure S2 ).",

While we are not aware of any studies explicitly reporting the relationship between human coronavirus epitope abundance and immune response, there is data in vaccinia virus that suggests that early peptide antigens are more likely to generate CD8+ T-cell responses while antibody and CD4+ T-cell responses are more likely to target later mRNA expression with higher peptide abundance in the virion (53) .",

First and foremost, while we note that a handful of our binding affinity predictions were borne out in experimentally validated SARS-CoV peptides (Supplementary  Table S4 ), we acknowledge that this is an entirely in silico study. As we are unable to obtain individual-level HLA typing and clinical outcomes data for any real-world COVID-19 populations at this time, the data presented is theoretical in nature, and subject to many of the same limitations implicit to the MHC binding affinity prediction tool(s) upon which it is based. As such, we are unable to assess the relative importance of HLA type compared to known disease-modifying risk factors such as age and clinical comorbidities (5-10) . We further note that peptide-MHC binding affinity is limited as a predictor of subsequent T-cell responses (54-56) , and we do not study T-cell responses herein. As such, we are ill-equipped to explore phenomena such as original antigenic sin (57-59) , where prior exposure to closely related infection(s) may trigger T-cell anergy (60-62) or immunopathogenesis (63) in the setting of a novel infection. We explored only a limited set of 145 well-studied HLA alleles, but note that this analysis could be performed across a wider diversity of genotypes (49) . Additionally, we did not assess genotypic heterogeneity or in vivo evolution of SARS-CoV-2, which could modify the repertoire of viral epitopes presented, or otherwise modulate virulence in an HLA-independent manner (64, 65) ( https://nextstrain.org/ncov ). We also do not address the potential for individual-level genetic variation in other proteins (e.g. angiotensin converting enzyme 2 [ACE2] or transmembrane serine protease 2 [TMPRSS2], essential host proteins for SARS-CoV-2 priming and cell entry (66) to modulate the host-pathogen interface.",

This approach may have additional implications for the management of a broad array of other viruses.",

In all cases, sequence conservation was assessed for each of three groups: only human coronaviruses (n=7), all betacoronaviruses (n=16), and combined alpha-and betacoronavirus sequences (n=34). Aligned SARS-CoV-2 sequence and all annotations were manually exported for subsequent analysis. Conserved human coronavirus peptides were defined as those with a length \u22658 consecutive amino acids, each with an agreement of SARS-CoV-2 and \u22654 other human coronavirus sequences with the consensus sequence (Supplementary Table S2 ). For each of these conserved peptides, we also assessed the component number of 8-to 12-mers sharing identical amino acid sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and each of the four other common human coronaviruses (i.e. OC43, HKU1, NL63, 229E) (Supplementary Table S3 ). For all peptides, human, beta, and combined conservation scores were obtained using a custom R v.3.6.2 script as the mean sequence conservation (minus gap penalties where relevant) (see https://github.com/pdxgx/covid19).",

Binding affinity was not predicted for peptides containing the character '|' in their sequences. Additional MHC class I binding affinity predictions were performed on all 66 MHCflurry supported alleles (--list-supported-alleles, Supplementary Figures  S7-S10 ). We further cross-referenced these lists of peptides with existing experimentally validated SARS-CoV epitopes present in the Immune Epitope Database (Supplementary Table S4 ) (76) . We then performed consensus binding affinity predictions for the 66 supported alleles shared by all three tools by taking the union set of alleles and filtering for peptide-allele pairs matching the union set of alleles. For the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 specific distribution of per-allele proteome presentation, we exclude all peptides-allele pairs with >500nM predicted binding. In all cases, we used the netchop v3.0 (77) \"C-term\" model with a cleavage threshold of 0.1 to further remove any peptides that were not predicted to undergo canonical MHC class I antigen processing via proteasomal cleavage (of the peptide's C-terminus).",

At right, the number of peptides that putatively bind to each of 145 HLA alleles is shown as a series of horizontal bars, with dark and light shading indicating the number of tightly (<50nM) and loosely (<500nM) binding peptides respectively, and with green, orange, and purple colors representing HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles, respectively. Alleles are sorted in descending order based on the number of peptides they bind (<500nM). The corresponding estimated allelic frequency in the global population is also shown (to left), with length of horizontal bar indicating absolute frequency in the population. Relationship between predicted peptide-MHC binding affinity and peptide conservation across coronaviruses. Every point represents a single unique peptide covering, together, the entirety of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. The best predicted MHC binding affinity scores across 145 different HLA alleles are shown for each peptide along the x-axis. Sequence conservation (Clustal Omega alignment score) is shown for each peptide along the y-axis. Pairwise relationship of peptide presentation between HLA-A, -B, and -C. In the bottom left three panels, every point represents the pairwise comparison of the number of peptide-allele interactions for all position coordinates. Taken together, the position coordinates cover the entirety of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. The top right three panels show the quantitative correlation scores between each pair of HLA type comparisons (*** indicates statistical significance).",
