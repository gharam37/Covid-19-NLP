However, coronavirus (CoV) is not the first-ever occurrence as it was initially discovered in the 1960s and belongs to a family coronaviridae [2] . Since then, several types of CoV were identified amongst which Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) are of importance [3] . As of 27 March 2020, a total of 509,164 confirmed cases and 23,335 deaths of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported globally, effecting 151 countries, where around half of those reported cases and deaths are solely attributed to China [4] . However, within a short span of time, the cumulative proportion of cases and deaths outside China has been outstripped by the total number of cases and deaths in China, which has raised significant concern among the public around the globe. As a result, considering the rapid disease transmission of COVID-19 within and across the countries, on 11 March 2020, WHO has declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a global pandemic [5] .",

Of this note, hand washing has been considered as an effective measure in preventing the cross-transmission from one to another [9] . Social distancing is a technique where actions are taken to reduce the frequency of contacts and to maintain a proper distance between individuals in order to limit the transmission of any communicable disease [10] . Usually, social distancing would be in-place where the spread has been believed to happen in a broader community. Other social distancing measures include isolation and quarantine, which also play a major role, particularly among those individuals presenting with symptoms, including confirmed cases. Isolation is an act of separating the ill-persons with a contagious disease from a non-infected person to reduce the spread [11] . Usually, isolation procedures are commonly observed in hospital settings. While, quarantine is considered as one of the effective methods in controlling communicable outbreaks and pandemics such as COVID-19, at a community level, where the movement of a person is restricted to the home or a designated facility, who are presumed to have been exposed to a contagious disease, but without having any symptoms [12] .",

Routinely, PPEs are widely used in healthcare settings as a standard to protect healthcare workers from infections [13] . Among different types of PPEs, face masks and hand gloves are the most commonly used in situations during emergency outbreaks, especially by the sick people in order to avoid the spread. Face masks have always been popular and well-known public interventions used as a self-protection measure. The use of face masks has been included in their pandemic plans by most of the developed countries such as the United States, France and Australia [14] . WHO states that wearing a face mask incorrectly may actually increase the chance of being infected, rather than decreasing [15] . Thus, the correct use of face masks is particularly essential while dealing with the situations during pandemics such as COVID-19. Implementing the above-mentioned non-pharmacological USPs during the COVID-19 pandemic would relieve the concerns of over-loaded healthcare systems as well as the public to a remarkable extent.",

So far, the course of the COVID-19 in India seems under control with lower rates of incidence despite the large population. However, looking at the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, especially its higher rates of transmission, things could alter unpredictably, leading to adverse situations, at any time.

However, the appropriate selection and efficacy of the respiratory protective apparatus have always been a controversy. As these coronaviruses are extremely small, they will have the ability to pass through the pores of both the surgical mask and the N-95 mask. Although the N-95 respirator apparatus has a good structure, which prevents the passage of virus, if it is contaminated and reused, there are high chances for it to become the source of infection instead [31] . The current study findings related to the proper use of a face mask are in accordance with a cross-sectional study that assessed the usage of face masks in a primary care outpatient setting in Hong Kong, where more than half of their participants have demonstrated the correct steps in wearing a face mask [32] .",

It also mentioned that the main purpose of the school closure policy during the pandemic might not be optimally achieved as most of the children may engage in outdoor activities during the school closure period. Secondly, a similar type of results was noticed with the workplace closure and home working interventions, where they are modestly effective and acceptable, while increases the secondary cost. Instead, these interventions would affect workplace business productivity and might not be equally convenient for all the employees. In this regard, it also stated that working from home with the use of recent technologies would only be beneficial for service sector employees but not for industries, which needs physical presence and outputs. Thirdly, voluntary self-isolation and quarantine of contacts are considered effective and acceptable. Also, when combined measures are in place, these can reduce the peak caseload and attack rate as well; however, there is an increased risk of intrahousehold transmission from index cases to contacts. It also added that those who are isolated and quarantined are likely to undergo distress due to fear and risk perceptions. Lastly, it reported that mobility restrictions are effective only if high travel restrictions are in place, and surprisingly, cancellations of mass events and gatherings have not proven to be effective during the influenza pandemic.",

The whole idea of the authors of this study is that rational preventive measures during epidemics could have a counter effect on the population in the long run as these measures might impact the behavioural changes of the public towards others, which could worsen the epidemic outcomes. However, policies and decision-making regarding mitigation strategies should not be generalized depending upon the dynamics of other pandemic modelling studies. Looking at the current role that is being played by the USPs and social distancing measures in combating the spread of COVID-19, it is worth and wise to implement and adhere to such strategies. In regard to this, the UK government has changed its action plan in dealing with the COVID-19 following a modelling study that estimated 260,000 potential deaths [37] . As a result, it decided to implement a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of infected cases and to quarantine the family members of those who are being infected, and possible school and university closures in order to prevent those huge number of potential deaths. COVID-19 pandemic has taught various lessons to the respective government bodies and healthcare sectors in dealing with this outbreak and how to be prepared in facing such types of outbreaks in the future [38] .",

Overall, correct responses for the beliefs towards USPs among study participants were found be relatively high, except for the questions regarding eating and sharing food with colleagues and friends during COVID-19 pandemic (67%) and wearing a face mask without having any symptoms (25%), which informs the need for educational interventions among the general public in India.Within a no time, COVID-19 has evolved as a world pandemic after declaring it as an epidemic and thus considering the current situations with no approved treatment yet, USPs and community mitigation strategies, such as maintaining personal hygiene, handwashing behaviour, social distancing, isolation & quarantine techniques, rational usage of face masks could play a major role in diminishing the virus transmission to a significant extent. Availing today's technology, certain steps such as sending alerts, disease updates, figures & facts, and precautionary measures regarding the outbreak through automatic text messages or pop-ups should be sent out by the respective telecommunicators in informing the public.
