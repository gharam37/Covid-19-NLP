Predicting the outcomes of such events in relation to possible interventions is crucial for societal and healthcare planning and forecasting of resource needs. Deterministic and mechanistic models can capture the main known phenomena of epidemics while also allowing for a meaningful interpretation of results. In this work a deterministic mechanistic population balance model was developed. The model describes individuals in a population by infection stage and age group. The population is treated as in a close well mixed community with no migrations. Infection rates and clinical and epidemiological information govern the transitions between stages of the disease. The present model provides a steppingstone to build upon and its current low complexity retains accessibility to non experts and policy makers to comprehend the variables and phenomena at play.",

Data available from the COVID19 outbreak as of early April 2020 was used. Key findings in our results indicate that (i) universal social isolation measures appear effective in reducing total fatalities only if they are strict and the number of daily social interactions is reduced to very low numbers; (ii) selective isolation of only the elderly (at higher fatality risk) appears almost as effective in reducing total fatalities but at a much lower economic damage; (iii) an increase in the number of critical care beds could save up to eight lives per extra bed in a million population with the current parameters used; (iv) the use of protective equipment (PPE) appears effective to dramatically reduce total fatalities when implemented extensively and in a high degree; (v) infection recognition through random testing of the population, accompanied by subsequent (self) isolation of infected aware individuals, can dramatically reduce the total fatalities but only if conducted extensively to almost the entire population and sustained over time; (vi) ending isolation measures while R0 values remain above 1.0 (with a safety factor) renders the isolation measures useless and total fatality numbers return to values as if nothing was ever done; (vii) ending the isolation measures for only the population under 60 y/o at R0 values still above 1.0 increases total fatalities but only around half as much as if isolation ends for everyone; (viii) a threshold value, equivalent to that for R0, appears to exist for the daily fatality rate at which to end isolation measures, this is significant as the fatality rate is (unlike R0) very accurately known.",

            "text": "Understanding the potential spread of diseases using mathematical modelling approaches has a long history. Deterministic epidemic models published in the early 20 th century already demonstrated the importance of understanding the population-based dynamics as well as potential parameters of interest therein (Kermack & McKendrick, 1927) . Numerous modelling approaches are available for the prediction of propagation of infectious diseases (May & Anderson, 1979; Capasso & Wilson, 1997; Hethcote, 2000; McCallum et al., 2001; Ruan & Wang, 2003; Li et al., 2004; Keeling & Eames, 2005; Grassly & Fraser, 2008; Keeling & Rohani, 2008; Balcan et al., 2010; Britton, 2010; Funk et al., 2010; Gray et al., 2011; Brauer et al., 2012; Miller et al., 2012; Siettos & Russo, 2013; Pastor-Satorras et al., 2015) . Their outputs inform studies on health projections and play an important role in shaping policies related to public health (Murray and Lopez, 1997a , 1997b , 1997c , and 1997d Ferguson et al., 2006) . Data availability has greatly increased in recent years, which led to direct improvements in epidemiological models (Colizza et al., 2006; Riley, 2007; Siettos & Russo, 2013) . These models provided a more comprehensive understanding of recent outbreaks of diseases such as Ebola (Gomes et al., 2014; WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014) and Zika (Zhang et al., 2017) . However, all modelling efforts are highly dependent on several elements: a comprehensive algorithm of clinical and public health true options and stages of events; probability of such options given certain conditions of the system; identification of parameters that reflect such events and their probabilities (such as mortality by age, infectiousness by contacts, etc.); assumptions for parameters with insufficient data; and valid data for those parameters that allow the calibration and posterior validation of the forecasts (Tizzoni et al., 2012) .",

This was the case of the previous Influenza A (H1N1-2009) pandemic and it is the observation for COVID-19 pandemic (Russel et al., 2020) .

With novel diseasespecific epidemic models, the development of models with the sufficient level of low complexity and meaningful parameters, that can be identified with data as the infection progresses and data become more available, is posited as a potential tool to inform public health policy and impact mitigation strategies (Berezovskaya et al., 2005; Hall et al., 2007; Bettencourt et al., 2008; Nishiura, 2011; Wang & Zhao, 2012; Lee et al., 2013; Nsoesie et al., 2014 , Chowell et al., 2016 , Rivers et al., 2019 .

Given the complexity and the expected short and long-lasting impacts that these public health interventions should have when dealing with disease outbreaks and pandemics (Reluga, 2010; Fenichel et al., 2011) sufficiently complex but user-accessible modelling tools should provide researchers, public health authorities, and the general public with useful information to act in moments of clear and wide uncertainty. In order to work properly they require access to up-to-date data, in this case of the COVID-19 spread (Dong et al., 2020) . Additionally, simple and interactive models can contribute to the understanding by broader audiences of what to expect on the propagation of infectious diseases and how specific interventions may help. This increased awareness of the disease behaviour and potential course in time by public and policy makers can directly and positively impact the outcome of epidemic outbreaks (Funk et al., 2009) .",

Such models allow for the description of the underlying processes in a mechanistic manner, maintaining therefore a direct interpretation of the model behaviour.

This suggests that for younger than 60, interactions, in order to decrease mortality should be lower to 0: complete social distancing and isolation and that based only on social interactions, most of the mortality decreased by partial social isolation will be in those older than 60 years of age. The number of fatalities appears clearly and directly related to social isolation as well as the speed at which the fatalities saturation will occur, Figure 2 (bottom right). The model is capable to capture this due to its description of the saturation of the healthcare capacity and withdrawal of critical care over capacity. The middle and bottom graphs in Figure 2 show the impact of nih on the time course of several variables. Figure 2 (middle left) supports the \"flatten the curve\" concept, now globally popular. If interactions are not modified, the number of cases grows rapidly, exponentially and explosively. The impact of imposed social isolation selective to those over 60 years old is evaluated in this scenario. The parameter that describes this intervention is the average number of daily social interactions with other people that healthy susceptible individuals within the age groups over 60 years old have (nih). In this scenario, the isolation measures are applied selectively only to the elderly. Figure 3 illustrates the model predictions for this scenario, in terms of the output variables indicated, in absence of any other interventions. As shown in Figure 3 (top left) the selective social isolation of the elderly has a potentially very significant impact on final total fatalities at an almost comparable level than the previous scenario of universal isolation. This is a result with potentially significant consequences as it indicates that a sustained isolation selective only to the elderly and not to the other age groups could alleviate the economic damage at small numbers of increased total fatalities. The decrease in social interactions in schools and colleges by isolation of the young may however have an impact on the overall multiplier of infections from youngsters to adults.",

The parameter that describes this intervention is the average number of daily social interactions with other people that healthy susceptible individuals of the age groups under 20 years old have (nih). In this scenario, isolation measures are applied only to the youngsters. Figure 4 shows the results for this scenario, for the output variables indicated, in absence of other interventions. The young population have been observed to be quite resistant to the disease. Theoretically at least, young, unaffected lungs tolerate and defend better from the viral load. The isolation of the young produces no effect in the overall final fatality rate but produces a moderate impact on the mortality of the elderly at low values of nih. As it can be seen in Figure 4 , social isolation of the young has little impact producing almost identical curves for any levels of social isolation. It is thought however that the decrease in social interactions in schools and colleges by isolation of the young may have a large impact on the overall multiplier of infections from youngsters to adults.

Data available from the COVID19 outbreak as of early April 2020 was used. Our preliminary results for scenarios above and parameter values used indicate that:1. Universal social isolation measures may be effective in reducing total fatalities only if they are strict and the average number of daily social interactions is reduced to very low numbers.2. Selective isolation of only the age groups most vulnerable to the disease (i.e. older than 60) appears almost as effective in reducing total fatalities but at a much lower economic damage. The comparison between impacts of social isolation interventions to all or selective by age on the final total number of fatalities ( Figure 13 ) shows that the isolation of the elderly can achieve equivalent impact to that of all.3. An increase in the number of critical care beds could save up significant numbers of lives. Using our current parameters values, for a one million population, an estimate of 8 fatalities could be avoided per extra available critical care unit.4. The use of protective equipment (PPE) appears capable of very significantly reducing total fatalities if implemented extensively and to a high degree; 5. Extensive random testing of the population leading to infection recognition and subsequent immediate (self) isolation of the infected individuals, can dramatically reduce the total fatalities but only if implemented to almost the entire population and sustained over time.6. Ending isolation measures with R0 above one (with a safety factor) appears to renders the previous isolation measures useless as fatality rate eventually reaches values close to if nothing was ever done; 7. Ending isolation measures only for the population under 60 y/o with R0 values still above one increases total fatalities but only around half as much as if isolation is ended for everyone. 8. A threshold value for daily fatality rate (equivalent to the R0 below one) appears to exist for the feasible end of isolation measures. Daily fatality rates are known very accurately unlike the R0 and could be used criteria for intervention. In Figure 14 the impacts on total final number of fatalities of the withdrawal of social isolation from threshold values for (R0) and of daily fatality rate per million people are shown. A comparison between the cases when withdrawal is done universally or restricted only to those under 60 years old is shown.It is important to note that any interpretation of the above results for the COVID19 outbreak interventions must be considered only qualitatively at this stage due to the low confidence (lack of complete and valid data) on the parameter values available at the time of writing. Any quantitative interpretation of the results must be accompanied with a critical discussion in terms of the model limitations and its frame of application. Next immediate steps involve the sensitivity analysis of the parameters with the lowest confidence. A roadmap for model expansion and broader implementation is discussed below.",
