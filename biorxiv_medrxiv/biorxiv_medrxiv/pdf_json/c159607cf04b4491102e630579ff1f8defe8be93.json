The first part of the paper studies the descriptive statistics and the influence of demographic parameters, namely age and gender, in the clinical recovery-period of COVID-19 patients. The second part of the paper is on identifying the distribution of the length of the recovery-period for the patients. We identify a piecewise analysis of three different periods, identified based on trends of both positive confirmation and clinical recovery of COVID-19. As expected, the overall recovery rate has reduced drastically during the exponential increase of incidences. However, our in-depth analysis shows that there is a shift in the age-group of incidences to the younger population, and the recovery-period of the younger population is considerably lower. Here, we have estimated the recovery rate to be 0.125. Overall, the prognosis of COVID-19 indicates an improvement in recovery rate owing to the government-mandated practices of restricted mobility of the older population and aggressive contact tracing.",

The case study of Singapore has been carefully chosen owing to the reliable, accessible, and available data from the official press releases of the Ministry of Health (MoH), Government of Singapore. The healthcare system of Singapore has been unique in its handling of the widespread contagion in terms of imposing strict lockdown, quarantine, and isolation, and aggressive, large-scale contact tracing and testing. 1000 individuals have been confirmed positive for COVID-19 during January 23-April 01, 2020, of which 245 have been discharged after clinical recovery. This gives an overall r ri higher than that of the world, as r ri =0.245. The positive confirmation has been made using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests on respiratory samples (sputum or nasal/throat/nasopharyngeal swabs), based on experiential learning from the outbreak of SARS in 2003 5 . Similarly, the protocol for clinical recovery or hospital discharge has been based on the results on the RT-PCR tests of two consecutive samples being negative over two days [2] .",

The measures include opening dedicated facilities (the National Center for Infectious Diseases (NCID), National Public Health Laboratory, and more biosafety level-3 laboratories), increasing capacity in the public healthcare system (e.g., negative pressure isolation beds, personal protective equipment, trained health professionals), and deploying formal (digital) platforms for inter-governmental agency cooperation. For containing the spread of contagions, systems have been in place for upscaled, quick-responsive, and aggressive contact tracing at entry points of the country (airports) and through local healthcare providers. There has been a holistic improvement, supported by increased economic investment, in building expertise in infectious disease management. This organized system has thus facilitated a controlled management of the pandemic COVID-19 in Singapore with patient-wise reporting to the public. Hence, a case study in Singapore pertaining to the demographic analysis of clinically recovered patients enables a systematic understanding of the recovery rate (\u03b3) of the pandemic.",

However, 12.6% of transmission has been found to be presymptomatic [4] , as analysed for seven clusters found in Singapore. While there is an innate uncertainty from the onset of symptoms in the symptomatic cases to a positive confirmation, the hospital stay from positive confirmation to discharge upon negative results exhibits more cohesive statistics, as can be observed with similar studies in hospital stay [5] . Hence, in this work, we perform statistical analysis of the recovery-period, i.e., length of hospital stay, of COVID-19 patients in the hospital. Also, the motivation behind studying the clinical recovery of patients is to assess the overall load on the healthcare system in terms of patient occupancy as the hospital stays determines the load. The clinical recovery studied in this paper corresponds to the hospitalization period for each patient. The demographic analysis of the recovered patients gives insight to shifts in gender and age-groups in the recovery of patients. This analysis further complements the observation in the transmission rate is higher in older males with comorbidities [6] . Fitting the data of hospitalization period to a statistical distribution is essential for estimating \u03b3.",

The number increased to 3 deaths by April 01. Owing to relatively low number of deaths in Singapore due to COVID-19 contagion during January 23-April 01, 2020, we have assumed death/mortality/fatality rate to be 0 in our work.

We performed descriptive statistical analysis using median and interquartile range (IQR), followed by fitting appropriate regression models. We consider two types of regression models. Firstly, we use the time-series of \u2206t r and fit a line using the loess model. Loess is a non-parametric local regression model for smoothening empirical time-series data [14] and scatterplots [15] . Secondly, we use the number of patients recovering for a specific \u2206t r as a count variable and fit multivariate linear regression models considering age and gender as independent variables, and \u2206t r as the dependent variable. Since we are using a combination of a categorical variable (gender) and numerical variable (age), we use generalized linear models (GLM) for regression, which is semi-parametric. Length of hospital stay (LoS) is a naturally skewed distribution, for which GLM's such as the Poisson regression model (PRM) and negative binomial regression model (NBM) have been used [5] . Hence, we propose the use of PRM and NBM for modeling \u2206t r .",

The overall median of \u2206t r is 11 days, which is the same as the gender-weighted median, and the age-group-weighted median is 10.7 days. Thus, the overall descriptive statistical analysis gives a conservative estimate of \u03b3 to be \u223c 1 11 . The remaining work is to estimate \u03b3 more precisely based on the influence of gender and age. There is a stronger influence of age than gender on \u2206t r , as the median values are similar for both genders. In contrast, it is relatively lower for the age groups of (0-9), (20-29), and (80-89) years, specifically. These age groups comprise of 1.6%, 14.6%, and 0.8% of the clinically recovered patients ( \u00a7Table 1). This result is significant as the age group of (20-29) years contributes the highest (27.3%) to the infected population. 88.6% of the patients in this age group have been confirmed positive in P 3 . Thus, our key conclusion is that since the most susceptible group of people has lower \u2206t r , the recovery rate \u03b3 is bound to increase further in the period after April 01 compared to the value estimated in our work.",

In particular, for the age group of (20-29) years, the median [IQR] value of males of 8.5 [8.25] days is lower than the median value of females of 10 [5.75] days. This also shows that there is a higher spread (IQR) of \u2206t r values in males. We further observe that the gender difference in IQR arises in P 3 in the G G G +cfrmDt +cfrmDt +cfrmDt grouping, which happens in P 2 in the G G G \u2212cfrmDt \u2212cfrmDt \u2212cfrmDt grouping.

Since the protocols followed in the hospital can be perceived to be similar for patients with closer hospital admission dates, the \u2206t r has more cohesive descriptive statistics in the G G G +cfrmDt +cfrmDt +cfrmDt grouping than the G G G \u2212cfrmDt \u2212cfrmDt \u2212cfrmDt one.

We have closely investigated the data on the positive confirmation and discharge/clinical recovery dates of 245 patients who recovered during this time period. We have used regression analysis, subsequent to a descriptive statistical analysis, to get an estimate of recovery-period \u2206t r (i.e., hospital length of stay (LoS)). We have found that the \u2206t r is time-varying, after performing periodization to find three significant periods, namely P 1 (January 23-February 03), P 2 (February 04-March 16), and P 3 (March 17-April 01). The estimates of \u2206t r varied from \u223c17 days in P 1 to \u223c10 days in P 2 to \u223c8 days in P 3 . We have used the loess model for time-series data to demonstrate the negative slope of the regression curve of \u2206t r in P 3 , in particular. We then estimated period-wise \u2206t r using generalized linear models for multivariate (linear) regression with Poisson and negative binomial distributions for count data. This shows an improvement in the values published for \u2206t r , i.e., 20 days [11] and 15 days [10] . This has led us to estimate the current recovery rate \u03b3 in the SIR model to be 1 8 = 0.125 from March 17, 2020 onwards.",
