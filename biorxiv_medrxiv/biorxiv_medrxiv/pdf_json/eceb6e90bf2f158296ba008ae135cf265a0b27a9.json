Until the first week in April, 2020 there were no licensed tests for the presence of serum antibodies against proteins of the virus. The first approved tests are now becoming available, but none use a format that can be scaled up for mass screening which is now needed for implementing various public health measures. As per a recent Pubmed search, less than 10 studies using serologic assays have been published and none are high through-put. Added value of this study High through-put antibody tests are needed in order to identify seroconversion, to perform serosurveys, identify potential donors for plasma therapy, assess the prevalence of infection in populations, identify healthcare workers who may be immune to SARS-CoV-2, and to study the nature of the immune response to this pathogen. The method described for detecting antibodies in SARS-CoV-2infected patients can be applied in hospital and reference labs, allowing the assessment of present and past infection in a much higher number of donors per unit of time than assays described heretofore.",

            "text": "The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is currently being used for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in specimens from the upper and lower respiratory tract. 1,2 Molecular testing is well established and has been used in clinical laboratories throughout the world for two decades. In contrast, testing of serum and other bodily fluids for antibodies (Abs) to infectious diseases such as syphilis, typhoid and diphtheria have been used for over a century. 3, 4 Antibody (Ab) assays are most useful for identifying individuals who have been infected with a particular pathogen and seroconverted. As such, they can be particularly valuable, for example, for identification of subjects who have had asymptomatic viral infections and those who have recovered and would no longer be positive in tests for viral nucleic acids. They would also be particularly useful for serosurveillance, to identify donors for COVID-19 plasma therapy, and to identify individuals who are potentially immune to reinfection. Antibody assays thus fill an essential gap both during and after the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In fact, in one study, depending on the time of testing postinfection, the combined use of RT-PCR and Ab positivity provided an advantage over either test alone. 5 We and others 5-7 have described tests for assessing the presence of Abs to SARS-CoV-2 in serum and plasma using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) platform with a recombinant form of the S protein of the virus and/or the central portion of this molecule identified as the receptor binding domain (RBD), consisting of amino acids 319-541. 7-9 We report here a modification of the ELISA assay in which beads labeled with a particular fluorochrome signature are coated with the soluble recombinant S protein or RBD, incubated with serum, biotinylated anti-human total Ig Abs, and phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled streptavidin. The readout is performed with a laser-based instrument. This is a high through-put assay that offers the advantages of being able to prepare the antigen-coated beads for thousands of tests in a single day and using at least 20-fold less antigen than is required for .

The titration curves are shown in Figure 2 . A prozone effect (the phenomenon in which a value below the peak is observed at low dilutions of sera) is suggested by the curves generated by six of the 11 sera tested against the mSpike. The prozone phenomenon was less apparent when using the mRBD antigen. Generally the maximum MFI values were achieved with serum dilutions of 1:100 or 1:200. Levels of Abs varied greatly between the specimens tested. For example, MFI values at a serum dilution of 1:200 from infected patients ranged from 25,000 to >200,000 (Figure 1) . Of interest, titration curves show that the specimens with the highest Ab levels (P#1c and P#2b) were from two different patients (P#1 and P#2), and these two subject were the two patients with severe disease at the time of the blood draw. (Table I) . Further study is needed to ascertain how and whether disease severity affects the level and type of Abs induced. However, it is notable that the level of Abs increased over a period of a few days in each of the two patients from whom we had longitudinal specimens (P#1 and P#2, Table I ). The factors that affect the variation in Ab responses (severity of disease, length of infection, gender, genetics, etc) are yet to be determined and will require a large panel of specimens from patients with adequate clinical and demographic data.",
