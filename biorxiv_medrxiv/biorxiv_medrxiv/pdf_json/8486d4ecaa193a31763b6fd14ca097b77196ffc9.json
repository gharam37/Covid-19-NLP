Similarly, we achieved CFR estimates for other parts of China at a reasonable level of 1.5% to 1.6% with data up to late January at which the simple CFRs were in the range between 15% and 35%.",

To test this hypothesis, we can allow the Poisson mixtures model to have one CFR at a time range and another CFR in the other time range, and test the equivalence of these two CFRs. This test of time-varying CFR could also be used to examine the effectiveness of population-level interventions. : medRxiv preprint 7 | P a g e The Poisson mixtures model proposed here can be applied to countries in the early and middle stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, for example, the US, Spain, Italy, France, and Germany.",

The CFR of an emerging infectious disease can only be determined after its outbreak, but the real-time CFR estimation during the disease outbreak, especially in the early stage, has to be made for public health decisions. There are two naive, simple methods to estimate CFR at a time point t using the cumulative number of deaths, recoveries, and confirmed cases at t. Denote D(t), R(t), and C(t) be the observed number of deaths, recoveries, and confirmed cases at day t. The first simple estimator equals D(t)/C(t) and the second simple estimator equals D(t)/[D(t)+R(t)]. Note that these two estimators are equivalent after the outbreak when D(t)+R(t)=C(t) [1] .",

The rationale behind this approach is that deaths and recovery conditional at any time point should both follow a parametric distribution (gamma distribution was used to fit the SARS CFR data). The limitation of this approach lies in the estimation of the parameters of this distribution, which require the often-non-public data of time from confirmed diagnosis to death and time from confirmed diagnosis to recovery. Here, we suggest replacing the gamma distribution by Poisson distribution, as we can see below that the knowledge of time to death and time to recovery is not necessary. The proposed model requires data of deaths, recoveries, and total confirmed cases recorded in each day since the outbreak of a population. These data for COVID-19 are publicly-available [7].",

Both parametric and non-parametric bootstrap can be used, and here we used non-parametric bootstrap that simulated 1000 datasets with D(t), R(t), and C(t) follow multinomial distribution with the observed proportions as the parameters, and the 2.5 th percentile and 97.5 th percentile of the estimated CFR from these 1000 datasets were the 95% confidence interval of the corresponding CFR estimate.",
