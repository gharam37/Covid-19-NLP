            "text": "Finding novel biomarkers for human pathologies and predicting clinical outcomes for patients is rather challenging. This stems from the heterogenous response of individuals to disease which is also reflected in the inter-individual variability of gene expression responses. This in turn obscures differential gene expression analysis (DGE). In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, we wondered whether an alternative to DGE approaches could be applied to dissect the molecular nature of a host-response to infection exemplified here by an analysis of H1N1 influenza, community/hospital acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis. To this end, we turned to the analysis of ensemble gene noise. Ensemble gene noise, as we defined it here, represents a variance within an individual for a collection of genes encoding for either members of known biological pathways or subunits of annotated protein complexes. From the law of total variance, ensemble gene noise depends on the stoichiometry of the ensemble genes' expression and on their average noise (variance). Thus, rather than focusing on specific genes, ensemble gene noise allows for the holistic identification and interpretation of gene expression disbalance on the level of gene networks and systems. Comparing H1N1, CAP and sepsis patients we spotted common disturbances in a number of pathways/protein complexes relevant to the sepsis pathology which lead to an increase in the ensemble gene noise. Among others, these include mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and peroxisomes which could be readily targeted for adjuvant treatment by methylene blue and 4-phenylbutyrate respectively. Finally, we showed that ensemble gene noise could be successfully applied for the prediction of clinical outcome, namely mortality, of CAP and sepsis patients. Thus, we conclude that ensemble gene noise represents a promising approach for the investigation of molecular mechanisms of a pathology through a prism of alterations in coherent expression of gene circuits.",

Thus, a second statistical test is required, namely gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). However, this is not without its own caveats. The major one is that GSEA depends on the statistical inference of DGE and DGE cut-offs [24, 25] . As a result, biological interpretations from DGE might be drastically affected by pitfalls arising from the fluctuation-response relationship, DGE thresholding and the choice of statistical approach for GSEA.",

From the whole blood expression profiles of patients under intensive care treatment we estimated how ensemble gene noise corresponds to a pathological state, such as sepsis, community/hospital acquired pneumonia (CAP) or viral H1N1 pneumonia (H1N1). From this analysis we identified a number of pathways for which ensemble gene noise associated positively with an individual health/disease state treated as an ordinal variable (healthy < early H1N1 phase < late H1N1 phase and healthy < sepsis/CAP survived < sepsis/CAP deceased patients). Finally, we identified pathways and complexes where deregulation is associated with a poor prognosis and predicted the clinical outcome (survival/mortality) for CAP/sepsis patients based on ensemble gene noise with high accuracy. We concluded that the ensemble gene noise provides a powerful tool for the discovery of systemic disease biomarkers, pharmaceutically targetable pathways and the prediction of a disease clinical outcome.",

We reasoned that this heterogeneity might be reflected in the inter-individual gene expression variability (standard deviation -\uf020\uf073 or variance -\uf073 2 ). Considering that a) RNA copy number is a mixed Poisson (e.g. negative binomial) random variable [26] and that b) logtransformed microarray hybridization signal intensities correlate with log-transformed RNAseq copy numbers [27] . It is easy to show that the variance of log gene expression approximates the biological coefficient of variation (bcv 2 ) [20] . From the first-order Taylor expansion for variance: \u03c3 , where is the log gene expression. The mixed Poisson random variable, , where bcv 2 , also known as the overdispersion parameter, is independent of mean gene expression ( ). Thus, for \u226b 1 (for genes with a large mean RNA copy number), \u03c3 . In other words, by estimating the inter-individual log gene expression variabilities from either microarray signal intensities or RNA-seq counts we can infer approximately the biological coefficients of variations for genes' RNA copy numbers.",

For CAP and sepsis patients we also accounted for age, including it as a random variable in the Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) [29] , see Methods. On average, the dispersions in log gene expressions in CAP, sepsis and H1N1 patients were significantly higher as compared to healthy individuals ( Figure 1A ). To that, for CAP patents' dispersions in log gene expressions were significantly higher for deceased patients as compared to those survived. Likewise, for H1N1 patients, dispersions in log gene expressions further increased in the late phase of infection ( Figure 1A ). For sepsis patients, on average dispersions in log gene expressions were comparable between survived and deceased patients for all analysed genes ( Figure 1A ). However, for genes for which dispersions changed significantly between healthy individuals and sepsis patients (Bonferroni adjusted p \u2264 0.05), their dispersions on average were higher in the deceased patients as compared to the survived (p < 0.001). Together, these suggest that host response to infection increases the biological coefficients of variations in genes' RNA copy numbers (as \u03c3 ) and substantiates heterogeneity in the pathogenesis of sepsis [8] from the gene expression perspective.",

Interestingly, we also noted significant correlations between the absolute changes in inter-individual gene expression variabilities (|\uf044\uf073 2 |) and the variances of log genes expressions ( Figure 1C ).

For CAP and sepsis patients, we assumed that a condition of the deceased patients was worse than that of the survived. We considered that healthy < survived < deceased can also be represented as ordinal disease state variable. Circumstantially, this is supported by distinct blood gene expression endotypes [8] and an increased gene expression heterogeneity ( Figure 1A ). Kendall rank correlation identified a number of pathways and protein complexes for which ensemble gene noise was positively and significantly associated with the disease state in H1N1 (FDR \u2264 0.05), and CAP and sepsis patients (Bonferroni-adjusted p \u2264 0.05) ( Figure 2A ). None of the pathways or gene complexes were negatively associated with the disease state at the specified significance thresholds. We used different p value adjustment procedures (FDR -less conservative, and Bonferroni -more conservative) for H1N1, CAP and sepsis patents due to the large differences in sample sizes (number of patients) between these data sets.",

Complex I is the first set of enzymes of the respiratory chain and it is the entry point for most electrons into the electron transport chain [31] . Interestingly, however, in case of the Complex I inhibition or deregulation, methylene blue (MB) can bypass it by acting as alternative redox mediator in the electron transport chain, thus, restoring mitochondrial respiration [32, 33] (Figure 2D ). MB is also considered to be a promising therapeutic in treatment of septic shock [34, 35] .

For this, we compared gene ensembles noise between survived and deceased patients in the discovery cohorts. The p-value cut-offs for the model features were selected based on maximization of models' training accuracy (see Methods). XGBoost hypertuning parameters: learning rate, complexity, depth, etc. were optimized based on the crossvalidation. To avoid overfitting, we used early epoch stopping, which was estimated from the test fold of the discovery cohort (see Methods). Because of the class-imbalance, AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves) was used to evaluate the model performance. The validation cohorts were hidden from the feature selection and training. AUCs for the discovery and validation cohorts were 0.871 and 0.707 respectively, suggesting a reasonable accuracy of the model. However, from the model scores, and evaluation of the model specificity/sensitivity it appears that the model is biased towards the prediction of major class (survived) ( Figure 3A , Table 2 and Table S2A ). Thus, class prediction balanced accuracies (bACC = Specificity/2 + Sensitivity/2) were 0.799 and 0.701 for the discovery and validation cohorts respectively. Nonetheless, the survival probability for patients predicted to have a high risk of mortality was significantly lower than the survival probability of patients predicted to have low risk of mortality in both discovery and validation cohorts. To that, our model better predicts the risks of mortality as compared to the Mars1 endotype inferred from the log gene expression unsupervised learning ( Figure 3C ) [8] . Potentially, this could be due to a lower inter-individual variability of gene ensembles noise as compared to log gene expression ( Figure S3 ).",

Likewise, AUCs for the validation cohorts were also higher as compared to the model predicting mortality for both (CAP and sepsis) type of patients (compare Figure 4B and 5B with Figure 3B ). To that, differences in AUCs between discovery and validation cohorts were lower for the models predicting mortality separately for CAP and sepsis patients as for the model trained on both type of patients.

As any gene expression analysis ensemble gene noise relies on the quality and completeness of pathways and the protein complexes' annotation. Finally, we noted that inter-individual variability of ensemble gene noise is significantly less than that of individual gene expression ( Figure S3 ).

Interestingly, both responses were correlated ( Figure 1D ) and both were dependent on gene variance suggesting that the fluctuation-response might drive changes in these two parameters of gene expression co-ordinately [18] . In all three cases (H1N1, CAP and sepsis), inter-individual variability was increased for a bulk of the genes.

Especially, we consider mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (Complex I) ( Figure 2D ) and peroxisome promising for pharmaceutical targeting. Increased ensemble gene noise for the Complex I would imply either altered stoichiometry, or increased gene expression noise for genes encoding subunits of the Complex I or both. As a result, this might lead to improper assembly of the Complex I and affecting its function. The impaired Complex I function can be bypassed by an alternative redox mediator, such as methylene blue [32, 33] . To that, methylene blue is a selective inhibitor of the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-cGMP) pathway [35] and increased NO levels is a hallmark of sepsis [42] . Some clinical studies have already indicated a beneficial role of methylene blue in the treatment of sepsis [34, 35] . Similar to mitochondrial respiration, peroxisomes also play an important role in the pathology of sepsis as the dysfunction of peroxisomes results in oxidative stress [43] . Again, an increased ensemble gene noise for peroxisome pathway indicates a potential mechanism for such dysfunction in H1N1, CAP and sepsis patients.

Previously some promising biomarkers and gene expression endotypes associated with septic shock and mortality have been identified based on DGE analysis [8, 9] . However, as already mentioned, ensemble gene noise looks at gene expression from a different, yet complementary, angle, thus enabling the identification of novel pathways and biomarkers for sepsis and other diseases. To that, models predicting pathology based on ensemble gene noise could potentially be more robust, as inter-individual variability for ensemble gene noise is lower than that for log gene expression ( Figure S3 ). Furthermore, Gradient boosted regression tree models trained on CAP and sepsis patients to predict their mortality had a good accuracy on validation cohort ( Figure 3 , Table 2 ). These outperformed predictions based on the Mars1 gene expression endotype, which was shown to associate with a poor prognosis [8] , both on the discovery and validation cohorts ( Figure 3C ). Interestingly, some ensemble gene noise features selected statistically for the models predicting mortality in both CAP/sepsis-, CAPand sepsis-patients couldimmediately be related to the host's response to infection.

Then, we trained 3 models: 1) a model predicting mortality for CAP and sepsis patients, 2) a model predicting mortality for CAP patients, and 3) a model predicting mortality for sepsis patients.

For CAP and sepsis (1) , and sepsis (3) models, the cut-off for the model features was set at p \u2264 0.01, and for the CAP model (2) -at p \u2264 0.05. The XGBoost hyper tuning parameters (learning rate (\uf068), complexity (\uf067), depth, etc.) were optimized by cross validation. To avoid overfitting, we found early epoch stopping parameters by randomly splitting of the discovery cohort into two equal folds: training and test.
