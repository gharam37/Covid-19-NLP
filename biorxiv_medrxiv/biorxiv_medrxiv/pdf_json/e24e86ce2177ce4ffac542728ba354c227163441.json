In our in vitro experiments, which were severely curtailed by prevailing circumstances, we used water as a substitute on the blood side. The water was saturated rapidly indicating that the system was flow limited rather than diffusion limited for oxygen transfer. Using these findings, we estimated the expected performance with blood and the results suggest that two dialysis units operating in parallel with a pure oxygen gas supply running counter-current to the blood flow, could supply up to 40% of the total required oxygen demand rate in an adult patient. While not studied, carbon dioxide elimination is likely to be feasible as well. It is thus possible that hollow fiber dialysis units operating with suitable roller pumps in a veno-venous access configuration, could serve as a cost-effective and readily available alternative or adjunct for respiratory support in the face of severe resource constraints. Verification and extension of our study is needed by well resourced laboratories who are still able to function during this unprecedented period of restrictions. If, after further studies and clinical considerations, this approach appears feasible, then consideration may be given to clinical deployment of this technique in desperate situations where no alternative exists to preserve life.",

The outlet pressure of oxygen is likely to be close to atmospheric pressure and also not highly influencial on the overall driving force for mass transfer since the driving force is very high at that point.

Hence, while it is not possible to exactly know the pressure in the membrane unit, it is safe to assume that it is considerably lower than the regulator's pressure reading.
