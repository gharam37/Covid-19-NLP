A rotating (Goldberg) drum was used to provide an environment where the terminal settling velocity of the 2-3 \u00b5m particles is overcome by the rotational drum speed, thereby providing a static aerosol suspension of known volume [5] [6] [7] . We timed aerosol samples from the drum at 10 and 30 minutes and 2, 4, and 16 hours after initiation of rotation/suspension. The entire drum volume (10.7 liters) was evacuated at each sampling interval and represented a discrete aerosol generation event. Virus contents in collected aerosol samples were quantified by plaque assay and RT-qPCR 8 . Scanning electron microscopy was also performed on the collected aerosol samples as a qualitative assessment of virion integrity after longer-term aerosol suspension (Methods, Supplementary Appendix).",

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging of SARS-CoV-2 revealed virions that were heterogenous in shape, either ovoid ( Figure 3A ) or spherical ( Figure 3B ). The minor:major axis ratio of oval-shaped virions was approximately 0.7, which is consistent with prior SEM analyses of SARS-CoV-2 9 . Airborne SARS-CoV-2 maintained the expected morphologies, size and aspect ratios up to 16 hours. All rights reserved.

Some efficiency determinations for SARS-CoV-2 ranged to -5.5 log10 , a full log difference compared to MERS-CoV. The fact that higher efficiencies trended across independent laboratories strengthens this observation. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 generally maintains infectivity when airborne over short distances, in contrast to either comparator betacoronavirus. Results of the aerosol suspension experiments suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is persistent over longer periods of time than would be expected when generated as a highly respirable particle (2 \u00b5m MMAD). This is remarkable, as there would be an expected decay and loss in the infectious fraction of airborne virus based on prior susceptibility studies with other relatively environmentally hardy viruses like Monkeypox 6 . A recent study 7 , showing only a slight reduction of infectivity in aerosol suspensions with approximately similar particle sizes, were suggestive of the minimal effects on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity observed in these results.",

Aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, whether through direct respiratory droplet transfer or fomite generation, may in fact be a more important exposure transmission pathway than previously considered 10 . Our approach of quantitative measurement of infectivity of viral airborne efficiency complemented by qualitative assessment of virion morphology leads us to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is viable as an airborne pathogen. Humans produce aerosols continuously through normal respiration 11 . Production of aerosols increases during respiratory illnesses 12 , and even during louder-than-normal oration 13 . A fraction of naturally-generated aerosols fall within the size distribution used in our experimental studies (<5 \u00b5m), thus leading us to the conclusion that individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have the capacity to produce viral bioaerosols that may remain infectious over long periods of time after production via human shedding and airborne transport. Accordingly, our study results provide a basis for a broader recognition of the unique aerobiology of SARS-CoV-2, which may ultimately lead to tractable solutions and prevention interventions in the ongoing pandemic.

The aerosol size distributions produced by the generators used, in mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD), ranged from 1-3 \u00b5m with a geometric heterodispersity ranging from\u2248 1.2-1.4. Aerosols were generated into nonhuman primate head-only exposure chambers (MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 2 ), a customized rabbit nose-only exposure chamber (MERS-CoV), or a rodent whole-body chamber (SARS-CoV) where the overall flow was approximately 1 (Tulane University) or 0.5 (NIH-IRF, USAMRIID, University of Pittsburgh) air changes per minute. Use of these chambers and corresponding flow rates allowed us to determine the dynamic efficiencies of the virus in aerosols over a range of 30 to 60s of chamber residence time. Samples were continuously collected and integrated throughout the initiation of respective nebulizers into the chamber during aerosols varying in duration from 10-30 minutes. The short-term aerosol efficiency or spray factor (F s ) is calculated as a unitless quotient of initial titer (PFU/liter in liquid stock) to the resultant aerosol (PFU/liter aerosol) and provides a quantitative indicator for comparing airborne fitness of viruses 3,4 . Figure 1 shows F s determinations for all three viruses when collected after <1-minute chamber residence time postaerosolization. Comparing both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2 aerosols generated with a Collison 3-jet nebulizer across three laboratories, there was a small but significant improvement in F s for SARS-CoV-2 compared to both SARS-CoV (p=0.0254) and MERS-CoV (p=0.0153). Comparing nebulizers, there was an improvement in F s for SARS-CoV-2 with both the Collison 6-jet (p=0.0066) and Aerogen Solo (p=0.0192) compared to the Collison 3-jet, but no difference between the Collison 6-jet and Aerogen Solo (p=0.4674).",

The curve, shown in Figure 2b from the results of split sample analysis as quantified by qPCR, showed minimal decreases in aerosol concentration measured in viral genome copies across all of the sampled timepoints and approximated the decay curve of the infectious virus fraction shown in Figure 2a, including similar decay curve characteristics (\u03ba = 6.19E-03; t 1/2 = 111.9; \u03c4 = 161.4).",
