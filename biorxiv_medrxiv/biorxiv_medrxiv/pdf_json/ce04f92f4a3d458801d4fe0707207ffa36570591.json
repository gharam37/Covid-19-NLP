            "text": "The predominant portal of entry for SARS-CoV-2 is via ACE2 expression in the upper respiratory epithelium and lungs, 3 yet ACE2 is also abundantly expressed in the intestine, kidney, heart and testes. The observation that twenty percent of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China had evidence cardiac injury resuggest a possible pathological role for myocardial ACE2 expression. 4 In a single-center report of 416 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 19.7% had evidence of cardiac injury. Moreover, the presence of cardiac injury was associated with a 5fold increase in mechanical ventilation and a 51.2% mortality rate. In this context, the potential for a primary viral myocarditis with SARS-CoV-2 is gaining support. Prior findings of viral RNA from SARS-CoV-1, which also infects cells via ACE2, in 35% of autopsied hearts during an earlier SARS-CoV epidemic, lends credence to this possibility. 5 Involvement of ACE2 in COVID-19 pathogenesis has led to consideration of whether inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) might modulate disease progression through increased expression of ACE2. 6 Indeed, trials proposing to test the impact of both initiation (NCT04312009) and withdrawal of these agents are being advanced during the current pandemic. This uncertainty has provoked public statements by three leading cardiovascular societies advising continuation of these agents in the absence of compelling new data. 7 To address these questions, we assessed ACE2 expression in normal and diseased human myocardial samples from the Penn Human Heart Tissue Biobank by bulk and single nucleus RNA-seq. Our group has previously utilized this approach to study the transcriptional diversity of the cell subtypes and associated gene programs in the normal human heart. 8 ACE2 expression was assessed in the left ventricles of 11 individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), 15 individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and 16 nonfailing controls defined as individuals without any overt indication of cardiac dysfunction. The baseline characteristics for the study population are provided in Supplementary Table 1. In an exploratory analysis, the effects of ACEi treatment on ACE2 expression were evaluated in the subset of patients with HCM, in which six individuals were receiving ACEi and eight that were not prescribed an ACEi.",

We also evaluated the expression of the proteases encoded by TMPRSS2 and CTSL, which facilitate membrane fusion and viral uptake during SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1, 9 TMPRSS2 was minimally expressed across all cell types, while CTSL displayed low levels of expression in all cell types with strongest expression in fibroblasts (18.1% and 56.7% of cells in the two populations found in non-failing controls), macrophages (39.1%), adipocytes (41.5%), and cardiomyocytes (11.4%) (Supplementary Fig. 1) . These results are in concordance with recently released single nuclei data from Chen et al. 10 Analyses of previously generated bulk RNA-seq data from these individuals show no significant alterations in ACE2 expression in the context of dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy compared to non-failing controls (Fig. 1b) . However, single nucleus RNA-seq highlighted a stark downregulation of ACE2 expression in fibroblasts, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle. There was a concomitant upregulation in ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes in DCM and HCM (Fig.  1c) . The complete cell subtype differential expression analysis of ACE2 in DCM and HCM compared to non-failing controls is provided in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 , respectively. A sensitivity analysis comparing the expression of ACE2 in left ventricles samples from individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy compared to non-failing controls after exclusion of individuals on ACE inhibitors or ARBs is provided in Supplementary Table 4 .",

Among these patients, there was a trend towards increased ACE2 expression with ACEi treatment in all cell types ( Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 5 ), but these results were not statistically significant. Future studies with larger patient cohorts to examine cell type specific ACE2 expression in additional disease states and in nonfailing donors receiving an ACEi or ARB are urgently needed. Further, it is important to note that transcriptional assessments do not reflect the effects of RNA half-life, translation efficiency, or protein turnover. As such, it will be important that surface localized ACE2 protein is also evaluated in future studies.",

Size and hue of the dot indicates the percent of nuclei expressing and mean log transformed counts for all nuclei in each cell type. VSMC: vascular smooth muscle cells b. Expression of ACE2 by bulk RNA-Seq from nonfailing, DCM and HCM ventricles. c. Single nucleus RNA-Seq from same tissue samples as (B) with mean expression of ACE2 in cell subtypes with appreciable expression. Arrows indicate the direction of statistically significant changes when comparing non-failing to both DCM and HCM. d. Effects of ACEi on ACE2 expression across cell types in HCM individuals.
