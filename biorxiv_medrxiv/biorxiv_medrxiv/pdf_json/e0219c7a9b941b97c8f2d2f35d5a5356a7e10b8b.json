            "text": "Background There is variability among clinicians in their ability to detect murmurs during cardiac auscultation and identify the underlying pathology. Deep learning approaches have shown promise in medicine by transforming collected data into clinically significant information. Objective The objective of this research is to assess the performance of a deep learning algorithm to detect murmurs and clinically significant valvular heart disease using recordings from a commercial digital stethoscope platform. Methods Using over 34 hours of previously acquired and annotated heart sound recordings, we trained a deep neural network to detect murmurs. To test the algorithm, we enrolled 373 patients in a clinical study and collected recordings at the four primary auscultation locations. Ground truth was established using patient echocardiograms and annotations by three expert cardiologists. Results Algorithm performance for detecting murmurs has sensitivity and specificity of 76.3% and 91.4%, respectively. By omitting softer murmurs, those with grade 1, sensitivity increases to 90.0%. The algorithm detects moderate-to-severe or greater aortic stenosis with sensitivity of 97.5% and specificity of 77.7% and detects moderate-to-severe or greater mitral regurgitation with sensitivity of 64.0% and specificity of 90.5%. Conclusion The deep learning algorithm's ability to detect murmurs and clinically significant aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation is comparable to expert cardiologists. The research findings attest to the reliability and utility of such algorithms as front-line clinical support tools to aid clinicians in screening for cardiac murmurs caused by valvular heart disease.

It is easy to handle, inexpensive, and its use is universally accepted-even expected-as part of a physical examination. Yet for the stethoscope to be a useful tool, it requires that the provider both captures and correctly interprets the diagnostic sounds of the patient. Though nearly all providers can perform the act of auscultation with minimal training, interpretation of the collected data is difficult, even for experienced and specialized providers. Inter-observer reliability for identification of a classic auscultatory finding -the \"murmur\" -is fair at best 1,2 , and the provider's ability to identify the true pathology underlying that finding is even worse 3 . Moreover, these challenges are further exacerbated by a noisy and rushed environment, which is the norm in modern practice. Despite the paucity of data in this area, anecdotally, these conclusions ring true for a wide spectrum of medical providers. Since cardiac auscultation remains a cornerstone of the physical exam, diagnostic assistance of its interpretation could therefore be of great use.",

Worldwide, valvular heart disease (VHD) is a major cause of mortality and reduced quality of life for tens of millions of patients worldwide [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . As life expectancies increase, so does the prevalence of VHD in the elderly. Annual VHD fatalities have increased 2.8% each year in the US since 1979 and are projected to double over the next 25 years 5, 9 . Many forms of VHD manifest with a prolonged asymptomatic period, which can be dangerous if not identified. Patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS), a common form of VHD, who do not undergo immediate aortic valve replacement have been shown to have an annual rate of sudden death of 3-13% 10 .",

Yet echocardiography requires both highly trained sonographers to acquire the data, as well as interpretation of the images by trained cardiologists. Accordingly, echocardiography is expensive, with the total annual cost of $1.2B for Medicare enrollees alone 12 . Despite its widespread use, it also requires a pre-existing suspicion from the referring provider, and it may not be locally available for patients in medically underserved areas. Because VHD is associated with textbook auscultatory findings 13 , cardiac auscultation can be a widespread, fast, and inexpensive tool to improve access to VHD screening, facilitate earlier detection of VHD, and reduce the need for unnecessary echocardiography. To begin to address this problem, we investigated the utility of an electronic stethoscope platform to develop a deep learning algorithm to identify cardiac murmurs.",

Indeed, an independently developed algorithm, focused on the binary distinction between pathology and normal, has tested favorably in a pediatric cohort, generating confidence in this approach 18 . Deep learning has also shown promise in utilizing auxiliary data unintended to be part of the original data set 19 , illustrating its ability to turn seemingly trivial data into useful information.

The algorithm was trained on recordings from a HIPAA-compliant collection of 400,000 audio recordings from Eko CORE and DUO electronic stethoscopes. The training set consisted of 5,878 de-identified audio recordings totaling over 34 hours from 5,318 unique patients. Recordings were initially randomly selected from the first 60,000 recordings collected and then sub-selected to ensure sufficient murmur examples to train the model. The training data quality is thus representative of what we expect in actual clinical use. The test set recordings used to measure classification performance of the trained algorithm are entirely separate and collected specifically for this purpose.",

Of the remaining, we group 40 having aortic stenosis of severity at least moderate-to-severe as cases and 103 patients without structural heart disease (i.e. no valve disease greater than trivial severity, and no congenital disease), as controls. As mentioned previously, the severity threshold for disease was chosen to include cases which would require evaluation for mechanical intervention. Figure 3 illustrates the flow of study participants. Importantly, whereas for the murmur detection algorithm the \"gold standard\" is simply the clinical interpretation (and likely more subject to inter-observer variability), for valvular heart disease screening, the \"gold standard\" is the echocardiogram. Since an aortic stenosis murmur is generally loud, we defined a positive test as one where a murmur is detected at either the aortic or pulmonic positions. A negative test is one where no murmur is detected at the aortic and pulmonic positions.

These numbers are more sensitive than all the expert cardiologist annotators and more specific than all but one of them. The algorithm detects moderate-to-severe or greater mitral regurgitation with a sensitivity of 64.0% and a specificity of 90.5%, which is more specific but less sensitive than the annotators. Notably, as \"algorithms\" themselves, the annotators fall nearly directly on the ROC curve of the deep learning algorithm, as applied to mitral regurgitation. As seen for both detection of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation, there is considerable variability in performance amongst annotators, even amongst highly trained experts. This likely represents variability in real-world practices amongst clinicians, which is a considerable challenge. This emphasizes the need for a real-time tool that could obviate this inter-observer variability, and the algorithm tested here, when paired with an electronic stethoscope, does exactly this.",

            "text": "The algorithm presented here is intended as a decision support tool for clinicians, and our data support its use in detecting murmurs attributed to valvular heart disease. To put this in perspective, in the general elderly population, where the prevalence of surgically intervenable aortic stenosis is approximately 5% 27 , a negative test, carrying a negative likelihood ratio of 0.032, will nearly rule out the diagnosis, reducing its probability to <0.2%. Conversely, applying the positive likelihood ratio of 4.37 in the setting of a positive result will increase the disease probability to 19%, though this would include non-surgical VHD disease given our study design. In both cases, however, these changes will almost assuredly affect clinical management. Moreover, it is likely that the overall accuracy to make a clinical diagnosis of VHD would be higher when combining the provider's interpretation of the heart sounds along with the algorithm results 28 . We anticipate that such a tool would be particularly useful in a hurried setting like an emergency department, where minimizing the time to diagnostic test results, as well as the strain on providers, is particularly important. While an emergent environment was not explicitly captured in our test set, we purposefully captured heart sounds in a real-world clinical setting to enhance the generalizability of our findings. Importantly, the algorithm tested here is designed solely for the evaluation of the presence of a cardiac murmur in single recordings. Auscultatory findings, however, are much richer than simply the presence or absence of a murmur. Indeed, classical teaching of aortic stenosis includes nonmurmur characteristics, such as the \"softness\" of the A2 component of the second heart sound, and the timing of the peak of the systolic murmur, as indicators of severity 13 . It is reasonable to conjecture that an extended algorithm, which includes more known signs of VHD in its decisionmaking process would therefore have better performance as a complete disease screening test. This is an area of active investigation and development for our group as low inter-observer reliability in the identification of other murmur characteristics, or even patients with specific diseases, creates many challenges for curating richly labeled datasets large enough for training comprehensive heart sound models. This, however, underscores the need for more investigation in this area. Though the test set populations may well represent the U.S. population, they may not reflect populations in developing countries, where the prevalence and etiology of VHD are different. As these populations would likely very much benefit from a potentially low-cost support tool such as this, further investigation in these populations are warranted.",

This may be attributed to aortic stenosis having a more discernible auscultatory signature. Moreover, its characteristic murmur can be heard in both the aortic and pulmonic positions on auscultation, offering additional data points for both the human and computer decision-makers. Physiologically, mitral regurgitation is a load-dependent murmur, such that severity of regurgitation can vary markedly depending on the minute-to-minute hemodynamics of the patient. Moreover, MR can be directional, and therefore certain types of MR may simply not have murmurs at a single auscultation location, like the cardiac apex. The higher rates of poor signal from the mitral position in our study only exacerbate these challenges. Further study of additional auscultation locations, or alternative, non-murmur auscultatory characteristics, would be useful to aid in improving the performance of VHD detection algorithms.",

First, the deep learning algorithm is accurate and reliable, with low inter-operator variability. It shows comparable performance to that of an expert cardiologist, suggesting it could deliver cardiology-level expertise to frontline clinicians in the field. Potential benefits include enabling clinicians to detect VHD earlier and more consistently, and potentially reduce morbidity and mortality due to earlier clinical intervention 29 . Second, the algorithm can detect heart murmurs at the point of care through cellular or wi-fi connectivity with the stethoscope and mobile platform. A tool that can serve as an affordable alternative for diagnosing VHD would be very valuable since echocardiography remains limited by cost, time, and access, especially in rural and underserved areas suffering from a shortage of cardiologists 30 . Third, in light of the recent and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 31 , the potential to provide expert level diagnostics through telemedicine, thereby limiting the transmission of a highly contagious disease, is also particularly attractive. Furthermore, the digital stethoscope platform employed here could be extended to investigate other auscultation findings, such as lung sounds, which may help improve screening for such disease. Fourth, to the extent the algorithm can accurately exclude valvular disease, it could reduce the burden of unnecessary echocardiography. Overall, our study shows the promise of this tool as an adjunct to clinical care, and illustrates the potential of it expanding into something even greater.",
