These articles, along with earlier related literature, compose a valuable knowledge base affecting contemporary research studies or, even, government actions to limit the spread of the disease and treatment decisions taken by physicians. However, the number of such articles is increasing at an intense rate making the exploration of the relevant literature and the identification of useful knowledge in it challenging. In this work, we describe BIP4COVID19, an open dataset compiled to facilitate the coronavirus-related literature exploration, by providing various indicators of scientific impact for the relevant articles. Finally, we provide a publicly accessible web interface on top of our data, allowing the exploration of the publications based on the computed indicators.",

Taking additionally into account previous literature on coronaviruses and related diseases, it is evident that there is a vast literature on the subject. However, it is critical for researchers or other interested parties (e.g., government officers, physicians) to be able to identify high-impact articles. A variety of impact measures have been proposed in the fields of bibliometrics and scientometrics [7, 8] . Some of them rely on the analysis of the underlying citation network. Other approaches utilise measures commonly known as \"altmetrics\", which analyse data from social media and/or usage analytics in online platforms (e.g., in publishers' websites). Both approaches have their benefits and shortcomings, each capturing different aspects of an article's impact. Thus, by considering a wide range of different measures we can better uncover a comprehensive view of each article's impact.",

During this process, the eSummary tool 3 from NCBI's eTool suite is utilised to collect extra metadata for each publication using the corresponding PubMed or PubMed Central identifiers (pmid and pmcid, respectively), where available. The collected metadata are semi-automatically processed to remove duplicate records. The resulting dataset contains one entry for each distinct article. Each entry contains the pmid, the DOI, the pmcid, and the publication year of the Calculation of Citation-based Measures. A prerequisite for calculating the citation-based impact measures of the collected articles, is the compilation of their citation network, i.e., the network which has articles as nodes and citations between them as directed edges. The citations of the articles required to construct this network are gathered using NCBI's eLink tool. The tool returns for a given article the identifiers (pmids/pmcids) of all articles that cite, or are cited by it. Two citation-based impact measures are calculated on the constructed network: the PageRank [5] and the RAM scores [6] . These two measures were selected based on the results of a recent experimental study [7] , which found them to perform best in capturing the overall and the current impact of an article (i.e., its \"influence\" and its \"popularity\"), respectively . Both measures are calculated by performing citation analysis. PageRank evaluates the overall impact of articles by differentiating their citations based on the importance of the articles making them. However, it is biased against recent articles that haven't accumulated many citations yet, but may be the current focus of the research community. RAM alleviates this issue by considering recent citations as being more important.",

In particular, we collect pmids and pmcids from both datasets and use them as queries to gather each article's metadata. After cleaning the article title (e.g., removing special characters) we automatically identify duplicates by comparing each record's complete content and eliminate them. Finally, manual inspection is performed to produce the correct metadata for a limited number of duplicates that remain (e.g., duplicate records containing the title of the same pub in two different languages). Further, to guarantee the correctness of the compiled citation graph we apply the following procedures. After gathering all citing -cited records using NCBI's eTools, those that include identifiers not found in the source data are removed. Since many citing -cited pairs may have been found both with pmids and pmcids, the resulting data may still contain duplicate records. These records are removed, after mapping all pmids/pmcids to custom identifiers, with pmidpmcid pairs that refer to the same article being mapped to the same identifier. The final resulting citation graph is based on these mapped identifiers. As an extra cleaning step, any links in the graph that denote citations to articles published at a later time than the citing article are removed. 11 To ensure that we retrieve a set of tweets about each article that is as comprehensive as possible, we collect not only the URLs in doi.org, Pubmed, and PMC, but also the URL to the article in its publisher's website, where possible. These latter URLs are very important, since they are widely used in tweets. To collect them we utilize doi.org redirections. To avoid incorrect tweet counts due to duplicate tweets, we used a simple deduplication process after the Tweet object retrieval. Moreover, the use of the unshrtn library to expand the short URLs from tweet texts ensures that our measurements derive from all available URL instances of each publication record, no matter how they were shortened by users or Twitter.",

As a consequence, no data for these articles are collected and they are not included in the BIP4COVID19 dataset. Furthermore, with respect to the calculated impact scores, it should be noted that the citation analysis we conduct is applied on the citation graph formed by citations from and to collected publications only, i.e., our analyses are not based on pubmed's complete citation graph, but on a COVID-19-related subgraph. Consequently, the relative scores of publications may differ from those calculated on the complete PubMed data. Finally, regarding the tweet-based analysis, since our data come from the COVID-19-TweetIDs dataset which only tracks tweets from a predefined set of accounts and which is based on a particular set of COVD-19-related keywords, the measured number of tweets is only based on a subset of the complete COVID-19-related tweets.",
