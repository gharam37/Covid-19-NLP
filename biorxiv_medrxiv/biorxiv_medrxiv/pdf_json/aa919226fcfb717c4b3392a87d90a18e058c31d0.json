Eventually it became a pandemic and more than 200 countries are fighting hard to contain the infection [1] . This has become a unique challenge for mankind as the competition has turned out to be against time due to exponential rate of infection spread. One of the best ways to contain the infection is rapid identification of positive cases and isolation. However due to limited resources random and widespread testing may not be feasible in populous countries. Forecasting regional spread can help identify future hotspots and distribution of infection which would eventually help to take containment measures.",

            "text": "A spatiotemporal epidemic spread model can accommodate both spatial and temporal correlations in data. However, most of the models either require disease specific domain knowledge [11] or are too spatially coarse [18] . Deep learning models can learn the dynamics of epidemic spread with high spatial resolution and high degree of accuracy with minimal initial bias due to its capability of highly nonlinear representation. Deep neural network based spatiotemporal models [4] have already been applied to predict epidemic spread. However, this model is experimented on a small localized region and influence of external factors are ignored. Deep learning models also tend to overfit to noise due to its high representational capability. Thus, modelling an epidemic spread in a wide region with high spatial and temporal resolution is challenging. To address the problem of spatiotemporal prediction of Covid-19 spread in a large geographical region with high resolution, we propose an ensemble of Convolutional LSTM [5] based model to be trained with multilayer temporal geospatial data, transformed as sequence of images. Each layer of the geospatial data corresponds to a causal factor that might influence the spread of the epidemic. We experimented with data of US and Italy and achieved country level mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 5.57% and 0.3% respectively on forecasting of total infection cases in 5 days period. The paper is organized as following. In section 2 we conducted a literature review. A brief discussion on modelling the epidemic spread and data preparation method is presented in section 3. In section 4 we explained the ensemble of Convolutional LSTM model and performance measurement metrics. Section 5 is about experimental results. The following section concludes the paper.",

Geographical location, weather conditions [7] , human mobility [8] , population statistics might be some of the impacting factors changing the dynamics of the spread. Epidemic spread is correlated in time as well as spatial dimensions. There is high chance of spreading the infection in spatially co-located geographical regions specially during community spread. Thus, a spatiotemporal model can more accurately capture the dynamics of the spread. However, it may be spatially autocorrelated in a small localized region but not across wide regions. Thus, we divided a large geographic region into relatively smaller grids and trained our model with samples drawn from local distribution of infection cases. The goal of the model is to forecast new cases of infection on daily basis in different regions across a country which can be added up to calculate total cases of infection. The model can be trained with historical time series data of new cases of infection in different regions along with some external spatial and/or spatiotemporal features. During prediction, the .

            "text": "All the observations in the dataset is mapped to a spatial region bounded by predefined latitude and longitude. The spatial region may represent a section of a single country or multiple countries. The region is geospatially divided in M x N grids of equal sizes bounded by calculated latitudes and longitudes. It is assumed that disease spread in locations within a grid is spatially autocorrelated due to its smaller size compared to the whole region. Fig.  1a illustrates a grid bounded by latitudes and longitudes. The box represented by the dotted line is called as frame. The frames have overlapping areas in all 4 direction. The overlap allows flow of spatial influence from neighbouring grids. Each frame is in turn divided into L x L pixels which includes the overlapping area. Each pixel represents a bounded area in geospatial region. The values in each pixel is mapped to certain feature in the bounded geospatial region. Separate frame matrices are constructed for each feature and concatenated through channels. For example, new infection count and population are two features and they represent two separate L x L matrices in a frame concatenated across a third axis. Each pixel in the infection count matrix contains the count of new infections (\u2206I) in the pixel area in a day. Infection count is distributed both in spatial and temporal dimensions. To reduce the variance, the infection count in a pixel is log transformed and normalized in 0-1 scale. Considering R0 factor of Covid-19 between 2 and 3 it is calculated that 60% of the population (P) in an area needs to get infected to attain herd immunity and reduce further spreading [20] . Similar to the SIR model [14] , the total population P is compartmentalized into susceptible (S) and infected/recovered/deceased (I) group. Susceptible population at any day is calculated as 0.6P \u2212 I. In a single day new infection count cannot exceed number of susceptible populations. Thus, a pixel value is calculated as ln(\u2206I + 1) /ln(S + 2). Total population is distributed spatially in similar fashion and it is assumed time invariant within a short interval. Pixel value of population matrix is calculated as ln(0.6P + 1) /ln(max(0.6P)). Each frame is represented as tensor of dimension T x L x L x C, where T is the total time span and C is number of channels or features. As shown in Fig. 1b each training sample in a frame is generated by sliding a time window size of W+1 by 1, leaving behind a test case sample of time window size of W \u2032 in the most recent period. Number of training samples in a frame can be calculated as T \u2212 W \u2032 \u2212 W \u2212 1. Thus, total number of training samples for all frames can be calculated",

However, it becomes difficult to learn long term dependencies for traditional RNN due to vanishing gradient problem [9] . LSTMs [10] solve the problem of learning long term dependencies by introducing a specialized memory cells as recurrent unit. The cells can selectively remember and forget long term information in its cell state through some control gates. In convolutional LSTM [5] a convolution operator is added in state to state and input to state transition. All inputs, outputs and hidden states are represented by 3D tensors having 2 spatial dimensions and 1 temporal dimension. This allows the model to capture spatial correlation along with the temporal one. In our model we configured multichannel input such that distinct features can be passed through different channels. Multiple convolutional LSTM layers are stacked sequentially to form a network with high representational capability. The network terminates with a 3D convolutional layer having one filter. This layer constructs a single channel output image as the next frame prediction. A single model may be prone to overfitting on training dataset and loose stability in terms of prediction made. Creating an ensemble of diverse models intended to solve the same task and combining the predictions made by them typically improves test accuracy and stability [12] . We used bagging or bootstrap aggregation [13] to create an ensemble of models. 60% random samples are drawn with replacement from the original training dataset and an ensemble of five models are trained individually. During prediction the output of each of the models are weighted as per following equation.",

Data has been collected from Harvard dataverse [15, 16] and [19] . For USA the data collection period is '2020-03-09' to '2020-04-08' and for Italy it is '2020-02-05' to '2020-04-10'. Test data period for Italy data is '2020-04-01' to '2020-04-10' and for USA it is '2020-04-01' to '2020-04-08'. Fig. 2a shows the region of USA which has been divided into 18x30 grids. The length W of each training input sequence is taken as 10 days. As shown in Fig. 2b , the region of Italy is divided in 7x6 grids. For both the countries the frames containing at least a single Covid-19 infection case will be considered for training and testing the model. The Covid-19 cases are marked in red bubbles in the map. Each frame in turn is divided in 16x16 pixels with an overlap Margin of 4 pixel. Training sequences containing at least one positive case are only selected. The model consists of ensemble of 5 Convolutional LSTM networks. For Italy each network contains 4 hidden layers with sigmoid activation. The output layer is a Convolutional 3D layer with exponential linear unit as activation. The models are trained for 30 epochs with mean squared error as loss function. Each Conv2D layer has kernel of size 3x3. The Conv3D layer has kernel size 3x3x3. The input and hidden layers have 32 filters. The input layer is configured to take images of size 16x16x2. Each frame in the input sample have 2 channels for 2 features. The first channel contains the normalized log transformed count of new cases per day. The second channel contains the normalized log transformed population in each pixel with no temporal variation. The region in USA is approximately 13 times than Italy and the distribution of Covid-19 cases in USA is geospatially highly skewed. Thus, grids are divided in four equal sections by a latitude and .

A set of 4 heterogenous ensembles are trained for each of the 4 sections. The configuration of networks is same as that of Italy except they contain 2 hidden layers and each network is trained for 20 epochs. The implementation has been done on Python and code is available at https://github.com/swarna-kpaul/covid19spatiotemporal. Table I shows the performance of the models in terms of KL divergence and MAPE. For both USA and Italy, low KL divergences states that the predicted geospatial probability distribution of total infection cases nearly matches with the actual probability distribution. The pixel level MAPE for Italy stays below 30%. For USA in 8-day forecasting period MAPE is 44% as there are many pixels in USA with low total patient count. A slight deviation in the prediction for these pixels shoots up the MAPE. Country level MAPE is low for both Italy and USA. Fig. 3a and 4a shows predicted vs actual total Covid-19 cases for a period of 8 and 10 days in USA and Italy respectively. For Italy the prediction follows closely with the actual whereas for USA it is little underestimated. Fig. 3b and 4b shows predicted vs actual daily new Covid-19 cases for a period of 8 and 10 days in USA and Italy respectively. Fig. 5a and 5b shows the distribution of total predicted vs actual infection cases in each pixel after 10 day and 8 day in Italy and USA respectively. The predicted distribution closely follows with actual with residuals distributed both on negative and positive side.",
