This political measure was strongly suggested by epidemiologic studies assessing the cost in human lives depending on different possible policies (doing nothing, mitigation, suppression) [1] [2] [3] [4] . Mitigation can be achieved by combinations of different measures, including physical distancing, contact tracing, restricting public gatherings, and the closing of schools, but also the testing for infections. The quantitative impact of very frequent testing of the entire population for infectiousness has been studied in a recent unpublished work by Jenny et al. in Ref. [5] . We will estimate in Sec. III that to fully suppress the COVID-19 pandemic by widespread testing for infections, one needs a capacity to test millions of people per day in Switzerland. This should be compared to the present number of 7'000 tests per day across Switzerland. 1 Here we suggest that by testing a much smaller number of randomly selected people per day one can obtain important quantitative information on the rates of transmission, so as to enable well-informed decisions. Figure 1 summarizes the key concept of the paper, namely a feedback and control model for the pandemic. The essential output from random testing is the growth rate of the number of currently infected people, which it-self is regulated by measures such as those enforcing physical distances between persons (physical distancing), 2 and whose tolerable values are fixed by the capacity of the health-care system. A feedback and control approach [6] , familiar from everyday implementations such as thermostats regulating heaters and air conditioners, should allow policy makers to damp out oscillations in disease incidence which could lead to peaks in stress on the healthcare system as well as the wider economy. Any other measurement of the fraction of currently infected people can replace the random testing, for example there are proposals to estimate this fraction from analysis of sewage water with PCR tests [7, 8] .",

If k exceeds a tolerable upper threshold \u03ba + , restrictions are imposed. For k below a lower threshold \u03ba \u2212 , and if infection numbers are below critical, restrictions are released. In the absence of a substantial influx of infected people from outside the country, and provided infection numbers are below a critical value, the optimal target of the growth rate is k = 0, corresponding to a marginally stable state, where infections neither grow nor decrease exponentially with time.

After the limit of the health system, i c , has been reached, a lockdown brings i down again. The exponential rate of decrease is expected to be very slow, unless extreme measures are imposed. The release of measures upon a reboot is likely to re-induce exponential growth, but with a rate difficult to predict. Three possible outcomes are shown in blue curves in the scenario without testing feedback, where the effect of the new measures becomes visible only after a delay of 10-14 days. In the worst case, i grows by a multiplicative factor of order 20 before the growth is detected. A reboot can thus be risked only once i \u2264 i * * \u2261 i c /20, implying a very long time in lockdown after the initial peak. Due to the long delay until policy changes show observable effects, the fluctuations of i will be large. Random testing (the red curve) has a major advantage. It measures i instantaneously and detects its growth rate within few days, whereby the higher the testing rate the faster the detection. Policy adjustments can thus be made much faster, with smaller oscillations of i.

When reduced to practice, special attention will need to be paid to all aspects of the testing methodology, from the underlying molecular engineering paradigm (e.g., PCR) and associated cost/performance trade offs, to population sample selection consistent with societal norms and statistical needs, and safe (i.e., not risking further infections) operation of testing sites. Furthermore, in preparation for the day when more is known about the immune response to COVID-19 and possible vaccines, we plan to revise our models for feedback derived from a reliable immunoassay with well-specified performance parameters, such as lag times with respect to infection.",

IV, we define the main challenge to be addressed: To measure the quantitative effect of restrictive measures on the transmission rate. Section V introduces the idea of randomized testing. Section VI constitutes the central part of the paper, showing how data from sparse sampling tests can be used to infer essentially instantaneous growth rates, and their regional dependence. We define a model of policy interventions informed by feed-back from random testing and analyze it theoretically. The model is also analyzed numerically in Sec. VII. In Sec. VIII, we generalize the model for regionally refined analysis of the epidemic growth pattern which becomes the preferred choice if higher testing rates become available. We conclude with Sec. IX by summarizing our results and their implication for a safe reboot after the current lockdown.

If additional restrictions such as physical distancing etc., are imposed, \u2206T increases by a modest factor and one can get by with indirectly proportionally fewer tests per day. Nevertheless, on the order of 1 million tests per day is a minimal requirement for massive testing to contain the pandemics without further measures. However, even while the Swiss capabilities are still far from reaching 1 million tests per day, testing for infections offers two important benefits in addition to identifying people that need to be quarantined. First, properly randomized testing allows to monitor and study the efficiency of measures that keep the reproduction number R below 1. This ensures that the growth rate k of case numbers and new infections is negative, k < 0. Second, frequent testing, even if applied to randomly selected people, helps suppress the reproduction number R and thus allows policy to be less restrictive in terms of other measures, such as physical distancing.",

Second, while the latter tests require a high sensitivity with as few false negatives as possible, random testing can very well be carried out with tests of lower quality in that respect. Indeed, an increase in false negatives acts as a systematic error in the estimate of the infected fraction of people, which, however, drops out in the determination of its growth rate, 10 as long as the fraction i is not close to 1.

Interventions were only taken based on the measurement of the growth rate. However, in practice, a more refined strategy will be needed. In case the infection rate drops significantly below i * , one might (depending on netting out political and economic pressures, something which the authors of this paper are not doing here) benefit from a positive growth rate k. We thus assume that if i(t)/i * falls below some threshold i low = 0.2, we intervene by relaxing some measures, that we assume to increase k by an amount uniformly distributed in [0, k 1 ], but without letting k exceed the maximal value of k high = 0.23. Likewise, one should intervene when the fraction i(t) grows too large. We do so when i(t)/i * exceeds i high = 3. In such a situation we impose restrictions resulting in a decrease of k by a quantity uniformly drawn from [k high /2, k high ]. The precise algorithm is given in the Supplementary Information. Figure 3 shows how our algorithm implements policy releases and restrictions in response to test data. The initial infected fraction and growth rate are i(0) = i c /4 = 0.0007 and k 1 = 0.1, respectively, with a sampling interval of one day. We choose \u03b1 = 3 and a number of r = 15 000 tests per day. Figure 3 (a) displays the infection fraction, U (t)/N , as a function of time, derived using our simple exponential growth model, which is characterized by a single growth rate that changes stochastically at interventions [Eq. (5) without the source term]. In the absence of intervention, the infected population would grow rapidly representing uncontrolled runaway of a second epidemic. At each time step (day) the currently infected fraction of the population is sampled. The result is normally distribution with mean and standard deviation given by Eqs. (6e) and (6f) to obtain i(t). The former are represented by small circles, the latter by vertical error bars in Fig. 3 . If i/i * lies outside the range [i low , i high ], we intervene as described above. Otherwise, on each day k fit (t) and its standard deviation are estimated using the data since the last intervention. With this, at each time step, Eqs. (6m) to (6o) decide whether or not to intervene. In Fig. 3 , each red circle represents an intervention and therefore either a decrease or increase of the growth rate constant of our model. Figure 3 shows the evolution of the fraction of currently infected people. After an initial growth with rate k 1 subsequent interventions reduce the growth rate down to low levels within a few weeks. At the same time the fraction of infected people stabilizes at a scale similar to i * . For the given parameter-set this is a general trend independent of realization. Figure 3 (b) displays the instantaneous value of the model rate constant and also the estimated value together with its fitting uncertainty. The estimate follows the model value reasonably well. One sees that the interventions occur when the uncertainty in k is sufficiently small.",

The crucial output parameters are the infection growth rates in the general population and spatially localized sub-populations. When planning for an upcoming reboot of the economy, it is essential to assess and mitigate the risks of relaxing some of the restrictions that have brought the COVID-19 epidemic under control. In particular, the policy strategy chosen must suppress a potential second exponential wave when the economy is rebooted, and so avoid a perpetual stop-and-go oscillation between relaxation and lockdown. Feedback and control models are designed with precisely this goal in mind.",

We emphasize that our estimate of r is conservative. If the manageable fraction of infected people is higher than what we assumed in Eq. (14b), namely of order i c \u2248 0.01 as the estimates of Ref. [4] suggest, the required testing rate decreases by a factor 3 \u2212 4 to a mere r = 4 000 \u2212 5 000 day \u22121 .",

This is in stark contrast to the nearly 14 days of delay required for symptomatic individuals to emerge in statistically significant numbers. After such a time delay a huge increase (by a factor of order 20) of infection numbers may have already occurred, which would be catastrophic. Daily random testing safely prevents this. Thereby the significant reduction of the time delay is absolutely crucial. Note that without daily polling of infection numbers and without knowledge about the quantitative effect of restriction measures, a reboot of the economy could not be risked before the number of infections has been suppressed by at least a factor of 10-20 below the current level. Given the limits of suppression rates that can be achieved without most draconic lockdown measures, this will require a very long time and thus translates into an enormous economic cost. In contrast, daily polling will allow us to carefully reboot the economy and adjust restrictive measures, while closely monitoring their effect. Since the reaction times are so much shorter, one can safely start an attempted reboot already at infection numbers corresponding roughly to the status quo.",

Such asymptomatic people will go undetected, if they have not been in contact with a person displaying symptoms.

After the limit of the health system, i c , has been reached, a lockdown brings i down again. The exponential rate of decrease is expected to be very slow, unless extreme measures are imposed. The release of measures upon a reboot is likely to re-induce exponential growth, but with a rate difficult to predict. Three possible outcomes are shown in blue curves in the scenario without testing feedback, where the effect of the new measures becomes visible only after a delay of 10-14 days. In the worst case, i grows by a multiplicative factor of order 20 before the growth is detected. A reboot can thus be risked only once i \u2264 i * * \u2261 i c /20, implying a very long time in lockdown after the initial peak. Due to the long delay until policy changes show observable effects, the fluctuations of i will be large. Random testing (the red curve) has a major advantage. It measures i instantaneously and detects its growth rate within few days, whereby the higher the testing rate the faster the detection. Policy adjustments can thus be made much faster, with smaller oscillations of i. A safe reboot is then possible much earlier, at the level of i \u2264 i * \u2248 i c /4.",
