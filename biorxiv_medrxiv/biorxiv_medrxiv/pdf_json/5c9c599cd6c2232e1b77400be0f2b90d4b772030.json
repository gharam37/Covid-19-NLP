Methods We combined a quarantined models with early stage evolution data in Italy (during February 20th -March 30th) to predict longer term evolution (March 30th, on ...) within different control measures. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies leading to faster confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 infections, we made use of time-dependent contact and diagnose rates to estimate when the effective daily reproduction ratio can fall below 1.

            "text": "The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) [1] [2] [3] has been defined pandemia on March 11, 2020 due to the global spread. The respiratory droplet transmission is the main contagious route of SARS-CoV-2, and it can also be transmitted through contact [4] . The latency period is generally from 3 to 7 days, with a maximum of 14 days [5] and unlike SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is contagious during the latency period [6, 7] . In Europe, Italy is becoming a particularly alarming and interesting place to study the evolution of the epidemic also thanks to the detailed information offered the Italian Health organizations and the relevant control measures adopted to prevent transmission. Based on Chinese experience and the estimation of transmission models published by Tang et al. [8, 9] , we develop an approach to the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of transmission in Italy (see also ref. [10] ). Our finding may be useful for inference, forecasting or scenario analysis. Despite the fact that epidemic is changing rapidly and our results have to be considered an estimation, the models we are using can be considered predictive and useful for the interpretation of such an unexpected event. A key factor influencing strongly the SARS CoV-2 outbreak evolution is the (effective) viral reproduction number (R 0 ) defined as the mean number of secondary cases generated by a typical infectious individual on each day in a full susceptible population, the mean R 0 ranges was estimated from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.962.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.894.39) in the early phase of the outbreak in Cina [11] . Our aim is the study of the relevant parameters of control strategies lowering the reproduction rate of SARS-CoV-2 and mitigating the consequences of the restoration of social normalcy. This last aspect is studied in some detail to investigate the measures to be taken to start restoration without running into strong secondary events [12] . 1 . Diagram of the model simulating the novel Coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2) infection in Italy. The population is stratified in Susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious but not yet symptomatic (pre-symptomatic) (A), infectious with symptoms (I), hospitalized (H) and recovered (R), quarantined susceptible (Sq), isolated exposed (Eq) and isolated infected compartments. Interventions like intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation are indicated (cfr. ref. [8] ).",

Our study suggests that the two parameters have to be activated at the same time. Requesting strict social distancing without reaching a critical value for R 0 in a reasonable number of days risks a failure and the lose of faith in the adopted mea- sures. The most favorable Scenarios (D) and (E) (cfr. lower panel of Fig. 4 ) need from 10 to 15 days before reaching values of R 0 < 1 despite a screening rapidity of 8 hours (from a starting point of 3 days). The inertia of the distribution can force the time interval up to one month before seeing visible effects. The improvement of rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 with automation and large number of sample processing, is essential in order to implement infection prevention measures lowering R 0 significantly. After March 8th, the measures proposed to reduce the social distancing in Italy have been enhanced each week in order to lower the contact rate (already as low as 2 contact per day, as assumed in the scenarios of Section III. The combined effect of the imposed isolation and a strong reduction of screening time can be seen in the lower curve of Fig. 5 (scenario (D) ).

In this case the reproduction number assumes the limiting values R tically lowered and (probably) one can even see such an effect already at the early stage of the epidemic looking at the recent data on upper panel of Fig. 5 (yellow squares) . The same approach can be applied to evaluate the evolution of an epidemic secondary event at the moment of a partial relaxation of the isolation measures adopted. Our findings manifest an unavoidable occurrence of secondary events, however they can find our countries prepared thanks to the delay obtained in the first phase by means of isolation. The strategy to implement is largely based on technological resources opening a new era of fast screening. For a deeper discussion of the results one wonder if the choice of the moment can influence the secondary event in a substantial way. The need of saving the intense care from a large peak of presence pushes the inertia of the event to produce a long time tail it is very hard to keep isolation for a corresponding period. However one can analyze the effects of shift in time. In Fig. 8 the results of this further analysis. The technological improvement of the screening process remains the relevant mitigation ingredient and the structure of the secondary event does not change enough to suggest a further delay.",

We found several estimates of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), including average exponential growth rate estimates based on inferred or observed cases at a specific time-point and early growth of the outbreak. However, we identified no estimates of how R 0 had changed in Italy since control measures were introduced in March or estimates that jointly fitted data within Wuhan and Italy and no estimate of secondary effects in Italy. Added value of this study In our study we estimate how transmission has varied over time in Italy, identify a decline in the reproduction number in late as a function the introduction of large scale control measures, and show the potential implications of estimated secondary effects. Implications of all the available evidence SARS-CoV-2 is currently showing sustained transmission in Italy, with substantial risk of outbreaks in different areas. However, the implement of rapid technologies during screening phase can largely influence the value of the reproduction number and support a (partial) relaxation of the isolation measures without introducing a large risk of secondary outbreaks.",
