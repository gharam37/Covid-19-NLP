In most of the cities (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo, and Kuala Lumpur), generalized additive modeling analysis showed the number of daily new confirmed cases was positively associated with both average temperature and relative humidity, especially in lagged 3d model, where a positive influence of temperature on the daily new confirmed cases was discerned in 5 cities except in Beijing, Wuhan, Korea, and Malaysia. Nevertheless, the results were inconsistent across cities and lagged time, suggesting meteorological factors were unlikely to greatly influence the COVID-19 epidemic.",

A novel strain of coronavirus was identified from the nasopharyngeal swab specimens of the infected, which was later designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the resulting pneumonia as coronavirus disease . With the number of the infected soaring up, on 31 st January, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) (2) . SARS-CoV-2, pertaining to the Coronaviridae, is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, which is closely related to SARS-like coronaviruses, and based on the phylogenetic analysis, these coronaviruses have a common ancestor that resembles the bat coronavirus HKU9-1 (3, 4) . Evidence has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 can transmit between human through respiratory droplets, fecal-oral route, direct contacts, and aerosols (5) (6) (7) . Moreover, the long incubation period (1 to 14 days) increases the difficulty of controlling the COVID-19 outbreak. Studies have shown the mean incubation period was 5.1 days (ranged from 2.2 to 11.5 days, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.5-5.8) (8) , and another study estimated the mean incubation period to be 6.4 days (ranged from 2 to 14 days) (9) . By March 28, 2020, more than 199 countries had confirmed cases, with more than 571,678 confirmed cases and 26,494 mortalities globally, among which 489,337 (85.6%) confirmed cases and 23,188 (87.5%) mortalities were reported outside of China (10) .",

Despite much data on influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and the SARS 2003 outbreak following the pattern, it is difficult to predict whether COVID-19 would follow the trend and will be eliminated in the coming summer, as our understanding of the forces driving the seasonality of infectious diseases remains limited. Since influenza is a common viral disease, a proportion of the population already possesses some levels of immunity and when more patients recover, herd immunity constrain the transmission of the virus. The low or absent prevalence trend of SARS or MERS-CoV in the summer was also mentioned to be strongly relied on the use of effective therapeutic treatment and strict public health measures (11, 12) . However, SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus to humans, immunity to this ongoing virus pandemic is limited and an effective pharmaceutical therapy or vaccine prevention is yet to be found.",

Geological features and latitude play a major role in forming a meteorological pattern. Lowen et al. assumed the seasonality of influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) epidemics in temperate climates mainly attributable to the low absolute humidity (19) , and the following factors associated with it, namely the low temperature, increased population, and low micronutrient levels (such as low vitamin D levels) (28, 29) . During the winter in temperate zones, the temperature and humidity are low, characterized by dryness and coldness, and viruses are more easily to be transmitted via aerosols than direct or indirect contact, where the low temperature renders the virus viable and stable in aerosols, and on the surface. However, in the rainy seasons of tropical regions, where the weather is hot and wet, the aerosol transmission decreases but the transmission by direct contact increases (30) ; although the high temperature can decrease the stability of the virus and reduce the level of aerosolization of the viral droplet, with the increased temperature, the amount of virus deposited on surfaces increases (31) .",

We also estimated the Pearson correlation and covariances between the daily COVID-19 new cases and daily meteorological factors using STATA 14.0. Generalized additive models (GAMs) with a Poisson family and logarithm link function were used to estimate the associations of daily COVID-19 new cases with average temperature and relative humidity. GAMs are useful for identifying exposure-response relationships from various types of data, particularly in exploring nonparametric relationships (32) . The GAM analysis was performed in R software (version 3.6.0) using the package \"mgcv\". We first established a basic temporal model for COVID-19 cases without including meteorological variables. To adjust for long-term trends and seasonality, we included penalized spline functions of time in the model. The degree of freedom (df) for time was optimized by minimizing of the absolute values of the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) of residuals for lags up to 30 days (33) (34) (35) (36) . Additionally, the selection of an optimal model was based on the lowest Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). Secondly, we built meteorological models based on the temporal models to account for the lagged effect of meteorological variables and the incubation period of COVID-19 (7, 37) . Specifically, we examined the effect of meteorological variables with different time lags including one-day lag (Lag 1d), three-day lag (Lag 3d), five-day lag (Lag 5d), single-week lag (Lag 7d), and two-week lag (Lag 14) to capture immediate effects and lagged effects, respectively. Automated penalized splines were used to fit the association between the daily new cases and each of the meteorological variables. The date when the accumulated cases exceeded 30 in each city or country was selected as the inception of the date incorporated in the model to equalize the starting speed of outbreak and thus avoid miss-interpretation and overfitting.",

Experiments in the last century reported that the influenza virus is more stable in cool and dry air (15, 16) . And with increasing temperature, the viability of the influenza virus in aerosol or droplets(38), and the aerosol transmission diminishes (27) . Lowen et al. reported that aerosol transmission of influenza between Guinea pigs was completely blocked at temperature higher than 30\u00b0C despite evidence of continuous viral shedding from infectious individuals; nevertheless, the direct contact transmission was not influenced, which was equally efficient at 30\u00b0 C and 20\u00b0 C (19) . Chan et al. reported that the viability of SARS virus was rapidly lost (>3 log 10) at high temperatures (38 \u2022 C) and high relative humidity (>95%) (31) . The better stability of the SARS coronavirus at low temperatures and low humidity environment might facilitate its transmission in the community in subtropical areas (such as Hong Kong) during the spring and in air-conditioned environments. This might also explain why some Asian countries in tropical areas (such as Malaysia, Indonesia or Thailand) with high temperatures and high relative humidity environment did not have major community outbreaks of SARS. However, such an explanation is not currently convincing regarding the results in the present study, where the increase of the temperature increases the daily new cases of COVID-19 in some of the investigated communities. The high temperature and high relative humidity in the tropical Asian countries like Singapore, and Malaysia also seems to have little influence on the expanding daily new cases ( Figure 3 ). However, this could have been confounded by multiple factors.",

As air-conditioners may increase the probability of spreading, it may be advisable to reduce the use of air-conditioners and keep ventilation.

            "text": "Humidity can influence aerosol transmission via altering the proportion of respiratory droplets undergoing aerosolization, and influencing the stability and viability of the virus within these aerosols. Respiratory droplets are generated in the high humidity of the respiratory tract. On entering an environment with low humidity, respiratory droplets reduce in size within seconds due to evaporation. At higher environmental humidity, respiratory droplets evaporate more slowly, and hence are larger and settle faster, and less aerosol nuclei are produced (39, 40). Previous studies have shown that influenza transmission between mice reduced as relative humidity increased from 47% to 70% (13, 41) . Moreover, humidity can also influence indirect transmission by changing the mass of respiratory droplets accumulating on surfaces, and affecting the survival of the virus on surfaces. While increased humidity reduces the number of droplet nuclei formed, the same mechanisms (reduced droplet evaporation and faster droplet settling) result in a greater mass of respiratory droplets on surfaces (39, 40). Area with relatively low temperature and humidity has a higher infection rate comparing with tropical areas because the cold and dry weather is suitable for virus to survive and transmit (42). Viability of influenza virus appears greater at lower humidity, and progressively reduced influenza survival with increasing relative humidity over the range from 27% to 84%, with an increase in survival at 99% relative humidity, the mechanisms underlying which may be due to the low evaporation from droplets at high relative humidity maintain the solute concentration thus protecting the virus (27, 43) . Alongside, 30-50 o N zone has become a zone for transmitting COVID-19 with similar average temperature of 5-11 \u2103 and 47-79% humidity, which may be influenced by transoceanic migration of virus, but the underlying mechanism is still not understood (44).",

Mice were substantially more susceptible to invasive pneumococcal disease in early morning hours than any other time of day(45), and more susceptible to influenza in winter than in summer (13) which was thought to be attributable to the daily and seasonal variation of melatonin (46). In addition, even in areas where many spend summers in air-conditioned spaces, marked annual variations in incidence constantly exist, and similar strains of virus appear almost simultaneously across vast stretches of oceans in areas of similar latitude around the globe (23, 24) . Therefore, although a higher temperature is associated with lower effectiveness of virus transmission, yet it does not necessarily suggest a lower chance for virus to survive. The natural fading out of the virus in summer is unlikely given the widespread use of air conditioners in developed areas and the dense population in the city area. Until an effective vaccine becomes widely available for the establishment of herd immunity and the discovery of efficient pharmaceutical therapies, strict public-health measures should be implemented, including social distancing, quarantine, tracing, facemask wearing, and promotion of hand washing.",

Because of the non-linear nature of the data, we also performed GAMs to quantitate and visualize the relationship using splines functions. However, there are several limitations. Firstly, numbers of cases in Malaysia, Korea, and Japan were obtained from the epidemiologic reports released by the Department of Health in the corresponding countries, instead of a daily update of case numbers, which is not available for these countries. Hence, some cases might be missing. Secondly, the duration of the study period was short and the number of cases in Malaysia, Singapore and Japan were small. Thirdly, we only considered two meteorological factors (temperature and humidity) in this study. Other covariates such as wind speed, pollutant concentration, population density, air conditioning use, rainfall, which could also influence the spread of COVID-19, were not included. Moreover, while we collected the meteorological data from the capital cities of Malaysia, Japan, and Korea, the number of domestic cases at the national level in these three countries was used for analysis due to lack of available data at their city level. Most importantly, we did not incorporate the public health measures into the modelling, which may greatly confound the results, but we chose the date when accumulated confirmed cases exceeding 30, based on the postulation that a certain level of public health measures had been carried out at that time, thus the confounding effects can be mitigated at some point.",
