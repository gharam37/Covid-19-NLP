Estimating the expected impact of the lockdown, and the potential effectiveness of different exit strategies is critical to inform decision makers on the management of the COVID-19 health crisis. We use a stochastic age-structured transmission model integrating data on age profile and social contacts in the \u00cele-de-France region to (i) assess the current epidemic situation, (ii) evaluate the expected impact of the lockdown implemented in France on March 17, 2020, and (iii) estimate the effectiveness of possible exit strategies. The model is calibrated on hospital admission data of the region before lockdown and validated on syndromic and virological surveillance data. Different types and durations of social distancing interventions are simulated, including a progressive lifting of the lockdown targeted on specific classes of individuals (e.g. allowing a larger proportion of the population to go to work, while protecting the elderly), and large-scale testing. We estimate the basic reproductive number at 3.0 [2.8, 3.2] (95% confidence interval) prior to lockdown and the population infected by COVID-19 as of April 5 to be in the range 1% to 6%. The average number of contacts is predicted to be reduced by 80% during lockdown, leading to a substantial reduction of the reproductive number ( \"# =0.68 [0.62-0.73]). Under these conditions, the epidemic curve reaches ICU system capacity and slowly decreases during lockdown. Lifting the lockdown with no exit strategy would lead to a second wave largely overwhelming the healthcare system. Extensive case-finding, testing and isolation are required to envision social distancing strategies that gradually relax current constraints (larger fraction of individuals going back to work, progressive reopening of activities), while keeping schools closed and seniors isolated. As France faces the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in lockdown, intensive forms of social distancing are required in the upcoming months due to the currently low population immunity. Extensive case-finding and isolation would allow the partial release of the socio-economic pressure caused by extreme measures, while avoiding healthcare demand exceeding capacity. Response planning needs to urgently prioritize the logistics and capacity for these interventions.",

Transmission dynamics follows a compartmental scheme specific for COVID-19 (Figure 2) , where individuals are divided into susceptible, exposed, infectious, hospitalized, in ICU, recovered, and deceased. The infectious phase is divided into two steps: a prodromic phase ( ) ) occurring before the end of the incubation period, followed by a phase where individuals may remain either asymptomatic ( * ) or develop symptoms. In the latter case, we distinguish between different degrees of severity of symptoms, ranging from paucisymptomatic ( )+ ), to infectious individuals with mild ( ,+ ) or severe ( ++ ) symptoms, according to data from Italian COVID-19 epidemic 19 and estimates from individual-case data from China and other countries 20 . We explore two values of the probability of being asymptomatic, namely * ( ) =20% and 50%, in line with available estimates [21] [22] [23] . Children are assumed to become either asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic only, as heightened surveillance data in Shenzhen, China, reported a zero median proportion of severe symptoms and a higher proportion without fever compared to older age classes 23 . Children are considered to be equally susceptible as adults, following Ref. 24 . Individuals in the prodromic phase and asymptomatic individuals (thus including all children) have a smaller transmission rate with respect to symptomatic individuals, as estimated in Ref. 9 . Different relative susceptibility/infectivity of children compared to adults were already tested before 25 .",

Intervention scenarios are based on the nationwide implementation of the lockdown in France starting March 17, 2020 at noon. On March 27, lockdown was set by authorities to last to at least April 15, and recently extended 3 .

If case isolation is performed on average 1.5 day after infection and is efficient (90% reduction of contacts), we find that identifying at least 75% of all new cases would be required to rapidly reduce the burden on the healthcare system during May while intensive interventions are put in place. Lower tracing capacity or less intensive interventions starting May would take several months before the number of patients in critical care in \u00cele-de-France decrease below 1,000. Under these conditions, a longer lockdown till June would aid releasing the pressure on the healthcare system while capacity is built. Also, it would be ideal to perform contact tracing and testing during lockdown or with strict interventions in place. The benefit of these measures would go beyond the epidemic mitigation and extend to revising and optimizing protocols to improve case-finding and isolation -compared to the first phase of the epidemic -under more controlled conditions (reduced mixing of the population).",

While large uncertainties still exist on the role of different transmission routes for COVID-19 43 , results on seasonal coronaviruses indicate that surgical masks may reduce onward transmission 44 . Masks are largely adopted or enforced in Asia, while they just became a recommended or compulsory protection in certain areas in Europe and United States, mainly as a precautionary measure 45 . If effective, their widespread use may help decrease the risk of transmission in the community. As more epidemiological evidence accrues, this effect can be taken into account and help further alleviate control measures. We did not consider seasonal behavior in viral transmission 12, 14 , because of current lack of evidence. In our simulated epidemics, multiple peaks are observed because of the implementation of social distancing interventions able to reduce the reproductive number below 1. If seasonal forcing is to be expected, the interplay with seasonality should be carefully considered in the planning of the short-and long-term control strategies 12 . We tested two values for the probability of being asymptomatic, as there still exist large uncertainty [21] [22] [23] 46 . Few studies investigated the clinical progression of symptoms over time until viral clearance. Additional household studies now launched in Europe will help providing a better understanding of the presence of asymptomatic cases and their contribution to transmission. Evidence so far seems to indicate that this fraction may be low 46 , therefore we presented in the main paper results for * = 0.2. Estimates of age-specific severity and case fatality rates are still rapidly evolving and often vary across countries due to different surveillance systems and testing protocols in place. Here we used estimates of age-specific severity informed from a model-based analysis on individual-level data from China and other countries 20 . Rates describing the hospitalization duration and outcome of a patient were based on French data 26 . Infection fatality ratios estimated by our model are consistent with estimates provided in Ref. 20 . We do not consider here data on comorbidities that will alter hospitalization and fatality rates.

While reconstructing changes in the contact matrices remains arbitrary, available elements support our estimates. First, our predicted reduction of 80% of the average number of contacts during lockdown is lower than the one measured in China in the cities of Wuhan (86%) and Shanghai (89%) 36 . Stricter measures were implemented in China during lockdown compared to Europe, including for example complete suspension of public transport, ban of cars from roads except for the essential services, barring residents from leaving the apartment in certain areas or limiting it to one household member few days per week, performing health checks door to door to identify and isolate ill individuals. These measures are expected therefore to have a more substantial effect on reducing the number of contacts per individual compared to social distancing measures implemented in many European countries. Indeed, under conditions measured in China, the ICU system is predicted by our model to receive less patients and clear them more rapidly than what we currently see in the data. Second, our prediction for contact reduction is close to, but larger than the empirically estimated 73% reduction of a recent social contact survey conducted in the UK during the lockdown phase 35 . Implementation of social distancing however differs in the two countries. For example, in the UK parks remain open, no self-declaration to circulate is needed, and displacements are not restricted on distance. Assuming the conditions measured in the UK, the model predicts a first peak in the upcoming weeks that substantially exceeds ICU capacity. Third, not being fitted to the lockdown period, our contact matrices reconstructed from social contact data lead to model projections in line with current observations. Trends in the hospitalization data should be closely monitored in the upcoming weeks. Overall, with fluctuations of the reproductive number close to 1, changes in these estimates may lead to different outcomes. Improved understanding can be achieved in two ways. First, collecting contact data in France during lockdown, as done in the UK, would allow a better measurement of the mixing patterns altered by social distancing. This, however, will likely depend on lockdown duration, possible changes in population adherence over time, and consequential strengthening of measures by authorities. As such, multiple data collection endeavors may be needed. Second, as new epidemic data become available, the model can be recalibrated during the lockdown phase to update short-time projections on ICU demand in the region. While overall findings on scenarios are rather robust to such updates, additional variations of the exit strategies can also be explored to test interventions more specific to the evolving situation in France.",
