Since then, the virus has spread to 205 countries or territories and infected around 1.2 million people, and around 65 thousand of them died as of April 5, 2020 [2] . These rates of infections and deaths have been changing daily because of their higher transmission capacity. Consequently, the witness countries' healthcare systems are now facing problems to treat the infected people properly, although many of them are critically infected and need comprehensive care (5%) [3, 4] . Essentially, these increasing rates are reported when the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic and asked countries to take aggressive measures that are even reflected in countries' various initiatives [5, 6] . The roots of transmission of this virus from an infected to non-infected person are in contact with an infected person's respiratory droplets (coughs or sneezes) [7] , and touching surfaces or objects that were touched by the infected person [7, 8] , and has the capacity to infect 2.28 persons per day [9] .",

Getting COVID-19 infected at this stage, therefore, may put them in further risk of occurring adverse pregnancy and newborn outcomes, including deaths; however, the estimate is lacking [11] . Similar to the current COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was reported in 2007 and showed devastating consequences if it occurred during pregnancy [9, 12] [20] reported that antibiotic therapy was avoided for all infected pregnant women, but oxygen support and antiviral therapy were provided. Under these circumstances, summarizing all possible symptoms and treatments are necessary to assist healthcare personnel. They, thus, would able to make evidence-based decisions to identify infected pregnant women early and provide the most effective treatments.

The causes are complications following getting infected and evidence of higher adverse consequences if it has happened with existing morbidity, and these could be added to the usual pregnancy and delivery-related complications. These factors may increase the occurrence of adverse maternal health and birth outcomes, although estimates are lacking. Notably, earlier detection of the infection through tests, symptoms, and effective treatments could reduce these risks. As revealed in this study, based on available published research, fever, cough, fatigue, and breathing difficulties are common symptoms among both pregnant women and infected general people following COVID-19 infection[23, 24]. Although most of the symptoms were almost similar, infected pregnant women had some additional symptoms such as sore throat, myalgia, and poor appetite. Postpartum fever was also highly observed in women following delivery. Therefore, close monitoring of these symptoms could be an effective way of early detection of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. Previous corona-like virus outbreaks, such as infection of SARS during pregnancy, reported malaise, chills, and rigors as common symptoms along with fever, cough, and breathing difficulties[25].Given that no specific treatments or vaccines have been discovered yet, the COVID-19 infection during pregnancy would put healthcare providers in additional challenges[23]. This is because of the possible adverse effects of the medicine used on the fetus as well as pregnancy. For instance, there is evidence that medicines such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are currently recommended for patients with COVID-19 [26], which may cause fetal harm [27] and adversely affect newborns through transferring from mother body by breastmilk[28, 29]. Therefore, cautions are needed in the treatment of infected",

These symptoms reported in a few relevant studies vary for pregnant women, which are inconsistent across studies. For instance, Liu et al. [19] identified cough, shortening of breath, and fatigue alongside fever as the most important symptoms of COVID-19 among pregnant women, whereas cough and fever were reported as vital symptoms of COVID-19 in the Zhu et al. [20] study. The treatments provided to the COVID-19 infected pregnant women were also varied.
