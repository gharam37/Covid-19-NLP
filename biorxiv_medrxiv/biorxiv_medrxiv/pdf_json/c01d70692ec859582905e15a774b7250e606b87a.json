Based on the extracted spatio-temporal information contained 166 in each phylogenetic tree described above, we calculated the distances based on predictor variables 167 associated with every branch of each tree, which were used to determine the correlation between the 168 duration of each branch in the phylogeny and its related predictor variable distance, including the annual 169 temperature, annual precipitation, elevation, runoff (an index that quantity of water discharged in surface 170 streams), soil humidity (commonly used to quantify topographic control on hydrological processes) 171 (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2005) , enhanced vegetation index (EVI), which can be used to quantify vegetation 172 greenness, as well as the pig density, and distance to the main roads ( Fig. 1 and Table S3 for more 173 details). Briefly, the distance between each farm (geographic coordinates) to the nearest main road was 174 calculated based on the Euclidean distance. We calculated the statistic Q, which represents how much 175 variation in lineage movement is explained with spatial heterogeneity when each predictor variable is 176 considered (Dellicour, Rose and Pybus, 2016). Here, Q= R 2 env -R 2 null where R 2 env is the coefficient of 177 determination obtained from the regression between branch duration against predictor (factors) distances, 178 while R 2 null represents the coefficient of determination for the regression between branch duration against 179 predictor distances, which were replaced by a null raster. Thus, the factors that were considered for 180 further Bayes factor (BF) analysis, were the ones that obtained positive Q values in at least 90% of the 181 tested trees (Jacquot et al., 2017). We approximated a BF value for all predictors tested that passed the 182 above-mentioned Q statistic. Predictive factors were treated as a conductance (variables that promote the 183 spread of the disease) or a resistance factor (variables that impede its spread). For the interpretation of BF, 184 values between 3-20 were considered \"positively\" supported, values between 20-150 were considered 185 \"strong\", and values >150 were considered \" overwhelming support\" (Kass and Raftery, 1995 supplementary Table S1 ). 193",

The second most well-supported 258 dissemination occurred from sow to finisher farms (BF > 17.9), and as in the previous case, was best 259 supported when we analyzed all systems together. (BF = 80.5). Likewise, the dissemination between 260 nursery and finisher farms (in both directions) also showed positive support (BF > 6). However, all routes 261 of dissemination that involved boar stud farms were rare events (BF < 3) (Table 2) . Furthermore, the 262 sensitivity analysis showed similar trends, where the results of the equal sample sizes these were less 263",

Given the economic 303 impact and herd health relevance of new PRRSv strain introductions, it is imperative to evaluate how 304 often PRRSv spreads among pig production systems, determine the role of each farm type, and identify 305 factors that may facilitate or keep PRRSv from spreading. We demonstrated that PRRSv circulation has 306 been mostly originated by transmission from outside of each pig production system, and this tendency is 307 more predominant during the PRRSv season (from November until May) (MSHMP, 2020). suggest that virus transmission between pig systems is common. It is not well 309 understood which transmission mechanism plays a role in the dissemination across systems. Airborne 310 spread has been suggested as a potential route(Dee et al., 2009; Otake et al., 2010). However, Arruda et 311 al., (2018, 2019) did not reach that same conclusion. Pig farm density as expected arises as a risk factor in 312 several studies and in our study, our phylodynamic findings agree with a regional spread as an important 313 factor for PRRSv dissemination among pig farms. PRRSv spread events appear to be relatively common 314 in farms located in highly dense pig areas and near main roads, while farms at higher elevations and 315 surrounded by denser vegetation were significantly less likely to report new cases of PRRSv (Arruda et 316 al., 2017). It is important to mention that the source of our sequence data represented a limitation for our 317 phylodynamic analysis since it was a convenience sample that can introduce bias into our analysis as the 318 number of sequences does not directly represent all PRRSv cases circulating in this study region. 319 PRRSv spatiotemporal dynamics 320 The spatiotemporal dynamic pattern exhibited by PRRSv is the result of its transmission dynamics and 321 how circulating strains have been affected by viral selection (Pybus and Rambaut, 2009; Volz et al., 322 2013). This can be observed in the shape of PRRSv phylodynamic patterns over the course of this study, 323 which shows a clear directional selection, which can result in the loss of genetic variation (Volz et al., 324 2013). Based on MSHMP data (MSHMP, 2020), vaccine usage increased between 2012 and 2014, which 325 could have impacted PRRSv genetic diversity for system A after 2012. But the increment in the number 326 of farms using vaccines during 2014 did not show a noticeable effect on PRRSv genetic variation. 327 However, the increment in the application of MLV's in mid-2015 showed an undeniable positive effect 328 on decreasing PRRSv genetic diversity (as seen in Figs. 2-5), similarly to the observations made by (Sun 329 et al., 2012; Jeong et al., 2018). However, to increase the robustness of future studies it is necessary to 330increase the farm coverage as well as the timeframe, not only related to the PRRSv genetic information 331 but also to the vaccination data.",

This difference may be related to pig farm densities, being our 335 study region more populated with an average of 3 farms per 5 km 2 , and a more loyal representation of 336PRRSv dynamics since we compiled samples of more than 92% of all farms in our study area. When 337 compared to the diffusion of other viral diseases, the spread of PRRSv was similar to rabies spread in 338North America (~37 km/year) (Dellicour, Rose andPybus, 2016). Consequently, there are important 339 aspects that have to be considered while analyzing the speed at which PRRSv spreads, for example, those 340 related with the overall pig health (i.e., absence of coinfections) and factors related with on-farm 341 biosecurity (i.e., presence of a line of separation, cleaning, and disinfection station)(Rappole et al., 2006; 342 Altizer et al., 2011; Lycett et al., 2019). Thus, further studies are needed to evaluate how biosecurity 343 practices and overall pig health may contribute in slowing or accelerating PRRSv spread, results of these 344 assessments can be used to predict the most effective biosecurity measures and optimize control strategies 345 that go beyond PRRSv (Silva et al., 2019), not to mention current diseases that pose large-scale 346 biosecurity threats to the U.S swine health such as African Swine Fever.347 PRRSv spread among and within farms of commercially unrelated production systems 348 Our analysis found relevant similarities in the spatiotemporal patterns of PRRSv spread among all farm 349 types of all production systems (Table 1, 2), which was similar to previously reported findings that used 350 data from one production system in the U.S. (Alkhamis et al., 2016). At farm type levels, sow farms were 351 by far the biggest spreader (Plain and Laurence, 2003) which was expected as they wean piglets on a 352 weekly basis and these can be transported several miles away to an off-site growing pig facility. 353 Phylogenetic results also showed that PRRSv introductions into sow and nursery farms likely originated 354 from finisher farms, which could be partially related to gilt development units sending replacement gilts 355 to sow farms (Dee, 1995; Perez et al., 2015). Despite the substantial efforts to improve farms' biosecurity 356 and immunization through the implementation of strategies such as, sow herd air filtration, gilt 357 acclimation, virus elimination strategies (i.e., load-close-expose and rollover) which successfully reduced 358 the number of PRRSv outbreaks (Corzo et al., 2010; Alonso et al., 2012; Velasova et al., 2012; Alonso et 359 al., 2013; Blanchette, 2015; Silva et al., 2019), we continue to observe significant PRRSv dissemination 360 routes (Corzo et al., 2010; Otake et al., 2010). Therefore, it is expected that changes in 361 immunization protocols, such as varying vaccine brands at farms of one specific system may have a 362 serious impact on PRRSv spread. 363 Within-production systems circulation (local) versus introduction of PRRSv from commercially 364 unrelated farms (external) 365 Between-farm animal movement has historically been associated with disease spread (Augusta et al., 366 2019; Moon et al., 2019; Machado et al., 2020). Here, we used structured coalescent models to infer 367 migration rates among commercially unrelated pig farms, calculating PRRSv dissemination not related to 368 between-farm pig movement. Overall, PRRSv dissemination in this region has been mostly characterized 369 by transmission between non-commercially related farms (external introductions) rather than within a 370 production system (local). In addition, we observed that during PRRSv season (November-May), the 371 external transmissions tended to be higher than during the rest of the year. While our analyses do not 372 necessarily reveal where spread events occurred or how viral lineages first entered a population 373 (Rasmussen et al., 2018), they reinforce the importance of PRRSv collateral spread and open the question 374 of how its dissemination is happening. The external introduction of viruses can occur through different 375 routes, as contaminated vehicles that service multiple production systems (i.e., general maintenance, 376 vaccination, cleaning or loading) (Otake et al., 2003; Dee et al., 2004), shared equipment (Pitkin et al., 377 2009), non-pig animal vectors (Otake et al., 2002; Schurrer et al., 2005), transport of semen (Christopher-378 Hennings et al., 1995) and airborne transmission (Lager and Mengeling, 2000; Trincado et al., 2004; Cho 379 et al., 2007; Dee et al., 2009). Knowledge gaps regarding local dissemination of PRRSv still exist, hence, 380 studies that consider phylodynamics coupled with epidemiological models such as susceptible-infected-381 recovered (SIR) to assess the relative contribution of between-farm PRRSv transmission routes are 382 needed. In addition, modeling allowed not only to answer \"how it can spread\" questions but also \"what 383 for\" issues, i.e. determining what effort is required for reducing transmission (Beaun\u00e9e et al., 2017). 384 Factors promoting or restricting PRRSv dissemination direction 385 PRRSv dissemination models, directions of lineages revealed the potential importance of two 386 factors that limited the spread of PRRSv. Vegetation density and high elevation, which are similar to 387 previous observations made by Mahesh et al., (2015) and Arruda et al., (2017). These authors also 388 highlighted the important role that topography may play in mitigating the airborne spread of PRRSv. In 389 the same way, a study on foot-and-mouth disease, which also used continuous phylogeographic analysis, 390 identified that the presence of pure cropland or mixed land use both had a negative impact on virus 391 diffusion (Duchatel et al., 2019). Numerous studies have shown multiple positive impacts of having 392 vegetation barriers surrounding farms (i.e., trees, shrubs), from reducing the emission of odor and 393 pollution, as well as the airborne spread of different pathogens (Malone, 2004; Patterson et al., 2008; Van 394 Ryswyk et al., 2019), thus it should be recognized as a possible biosecurity strategy. Similarly, high 395 elevated areas have proven to act as a natural topographic barrier for the local spread of pathogens 396 (Jacquot et al., 2017), where the slope of the terrain was found to have an association with a lower PRRSv 397 incidence (Arruda et al., 2017). The identification of the main drivers associated with PRRSv 398 dissemination could help in deciding about new farm locations, especially for systems located in highly 399 dense pig areas (Yang et al., 2019). Farms located in areas with higher farm density were more likely to 400 sustain new PRRSv introductions, as has been previously described by Firkins and Weigel, (2004), 401 Arruda et al., (2017) and Alkhamis et al., (2017, 2018). In addition, our results identified distance to the 402 main road as associated with increased chances for PRRSv circulation. This has led concern by the swine 403 industry (Reicks, 2019), since vehicle movement has demonstrated to have a significant impact on 404 increasing the transmission of several other diseases, for example, African Swine Fever (ASF) (Mur et al., 405 2012), Classical Swine Fever (CSF) (Bronsvoort et al., 2008), and for Foot and Mouth Disease (Muroga 406 et al., 2013).407Here, we showed that continuous phylogeographic reconstructions represent a useful tool to 408 describe and analyze the dissemination of PRRSv spread. Although the outcomes of phylodynamic 409 analyses can be exploited to investigate the impact of relevant factors on lineage dissemination diffusion, 410it is important to note that such analyses depend on inferred viral lineage movement and thus, on the 411",
