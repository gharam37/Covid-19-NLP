            "text": "The SIR ('susceptible-infectious-recovered') formulation is used to uncover the generic spread mechanisms observed by COVID-19 dynamics globally, especially in the early phases of infectious spread. During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number R o . The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e. across many nations) to an uncontrolled R o = 4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of R o = 2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low. A reconciliation between power-law and exponential growth predictions is also featured within the confines of the SIR formulation. Implications for evaluating potential control strategies from this uncontrolled R o are briefly discussed in the context of the maximum possible infected fraction of the population (needed for assessing health care capacity) and mortality (especially in the USA given diverging projections). Model results indicate that if intervention measures still result in R o > 2.7 within 49 days after first infection, intervention is unlikely to be effective in general for COVID-19. Current optimistic projections place mortality figures in the USA in the range of 100,000 fatalities. For fatalities to be confined to 100,000 requires a reduction in R o from 4.5 to 2.7 within 17 days of first infection assuming a mortality rate of 3.4%. : medRxiv preprint in epidemiology. This dispute moved inoculation from the domain of philosophy, 4 religion, and disjointed trials plagued by high uncertainty into a debate about 5 mathematical models -put forth by Daniel Bernoulli (in 1766) and Jean-Baptiste le 6 Rond D'Alembert (in 1761), both dealing with competing risks of death and 7 interpretation of trials [1]. Since then, the mathematical description of infectious 8 diseases continues to draw significant attention from researchers and practitioners in 9 governments and health agencies alike. Even news agencies are now seeking out 10 explanations to models so as to offer advice and clarity to their audiences during the 11 (near-continuous) coverage of the spread of COVID-19 [2]. The prospect of using 12 mathematical models in conjunction with data is succinctly summarized by the Nobel 13 laureate Ronald Ross, whose 1916 abstract [3] enlightens the role of mathematics in 14 epidemiology today. A quotation from this abstract below, which foreshadows the 15 requirements and challenges for mathematical models to describe emerging epidemics 16 such as COVID-19 [4, 5], needs no further elaboration: 17",

            "text": "A heated dispute about the effectiveness versus risk of smallpox inoculation was playing 2 out in eighteenth-century France, which was to launch the use of mathematical models 3 this, many and indeed the principal problems of epidemiology on which 23 preventive measures largely depend, such as the rate of infection, the 24 frequency of outbreaks, and the loss of immunity, can scarcely ever be 25 resolved by any other methods than those of mathematical analysis. 26 The classic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) paradigm, initiated in the late 27 1920s [6] , now provides a mathematical framework that describes the core transmission 28 dynamics of a range of human diseases [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , including COVID-19 [13] . A key 29 parameter in the SIR paradigm is the basic reproduction number (R o ). The R o is 30 defined by the average number of secondary cases arising from a typical primary case in 31 an entirely susceptible population of size S o [14] [15] [16] . The usefulness of R o and 32 uncertainty in its estimation are not a subject of debate, as reviewed elsewhere [17] , and 33 therefore are not further discussed here. 34 In the analysis herein, the SIR model is used to uncover generic spread mechanisms 35 observed by COVID-19 dynamics globally, especially in the early phases of infectious 36 spread. During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or 37 enforced in many countries around the world despite early warning signals from China, 38 Iran, and later on, Italy. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in many countries 39 where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of 40 COVID-19 R o . The analysis shows that there is global convergence (i.e. across many 41 nations) to an uncontrolled R o = 4.5 for COVID-19 describing early times spread. The 42 implications for evaluating potential control strategies from this reference R o are briefly 43 discussed in the context of mortality and maximum infections. Mathematical models of disease spread assume that a population within a compartment 47 (e.g., city, region, country) can be subdivided into a set of distinct classes [11] . The SIR 48 model classifies individuals in the compartment as one of three classes: susceptible (S), 49 infectious (I), and recovered or removed (R). Infectious individuals spread the disease 50 to susceptible and remain in the infectious class for a given period of time known as the 51 April 14, 2020 2/15 infectious period before moving into the recovered (or removed) class. Individuals in the 52 recovered class are assumed to be immune for an extended period (or removed from the 53 population). For the total population N = S + I + R, the dynamical system describing 54 the SIR equations are given as assumption is that the number of deceased individuals is << N . The dynamical system 64 in equation (3) assumption in SIR dynamics is the use of the mass-action principle. As with all 74 compartment models, mass action assumes that the rate of encounter between I and S 75 is proportional to their product. For this assumption to hold, it requires that members 76 of I and S be uniformly distributed in the space of the compartment [18] . Individuals -77 unlike molecules in an ideal solution within a closed container -do not mix 78 homogeneously. At minimum, the use of the mass action principle serves as a reference 79 model to compare more detailed mechanisms or explore data.",

A major limitation to 135 this exercise is that I(t) at early times, often determined from reported confirmed cases, 136 is uncertain and depends on testing frequency that may vary in time as I increases. An 137 alternative is to regress di/dt upon i at early times to detect the highest slope, which 138 can then be used to infer R o . This approach is also featured in Figure 1 , which 139 illustrates that the SIR dynamics exhibit rapid deviations from a linear di/dt with i set 140 by early times thereby underestimating R o (for a given \u03b3). Evidently, inference of R o 141 requires estimates of early time slope, which cannot be easily detected in practice.",

To this 199 purpose, the R o is expressed as a logistic function 200R o (t) = R o,c + R o,u \u2212 R o,c 1 + exp(k c (t \u2212 t 50 )) ,(6)whereR o,c and R o,u are the 'controlled' and 'uncontrolled' values of R o (set to 4.5), k c 201 is the steepness of the intervention curve and t 50 is the time when 202 R o (t) = (R o,c + R o,u )/2. Model results accounting for different intervention scenarios 203 (Fig. 5) resemble the trends observed in the Italian provinces with the timing and 204 magnitude of R o reductions shifting the linear relation down and decreasing the 205 maximum fraction of infected individuals. Such jumps are smoothed over at the 206 national level where a clear deviation from exponential is observed (Fig. 3). 207 An alternative hypothesis: power-law vs exponential 208 Whether these results are suggestive of a global convergence to an uncontrolled R o = 4.5 209 or to some other dimensionless property must not be overlooked. A linear relation on a 210 log-log representation may also be indicative of power-law solutions at early times, 211 already documented in a number of studies for COVID-19 [29, 30]. In fact, published 212 analysis of infection data from the top 25 affected countries reveals approximate 213 power-law behavior of the form I \u223c t a (or log(i) = a log(t) + b) with two different 214growth patterns[29]: steady power law growth with moderate scaling exponents (i.e., 215 a =3-5) or explosive power law growth with dramatic scaling exponents (i.e., a =8-11).",

Selected UTLAs and provinces are shown in the top right and bottom right panels, respectively. Within the confines of the SIR dynamical system framework here, we ask: what are 217 the necessary modifications to obtain power-law solutions at early times? Such a 218 solution, while not unique, may be possible by revising the force of infection as 219 \u03bb(I) = \u03b2(I/N ) m . The original SIR model is recovered when m=1. For this non-linear 220 force of infection, the SIR system becomes ensures that the total population maintains its constant value N \u2248 S o 225 here. The early times dynamics (i.e. S(t) \u2248 S o ) for the non-dimensional infection 226 compartment i = I/S o are now governed by m < 1, maintaining a definition of R o = \u03b2/\u03b3 > 1 (epidemic), and noting that 229 i << 1, the first term on the right-hand side of equation (10) is much larger than the 230 second term. In fact, to obtain a maximum exponent enveloping the early-time relation 231 between di/dt and i, the linear term can be dropped so that di/dt \u2248 \u03b2i m (only a 232 growth phase). On a log-log representation, log(di/dt) = m log(i) + log(\u03b2). A constant 233 slope such as those featured in Figures 2 and 3 may simply be estimates of m instead of 234 R o . The initial conjecture is that a power-law solution emerges from the modified SIR 235 dynamics when m < 1. However, the slope here (= 3.5) actually exceeds unity Modeled (1/S o )(dI/dt) as a function of I/S o when considering a time-varying R o (t). Five scenarios are illustrated (inset): no intervention (red) with R o = 4.5 set to its uncontrolled value, R o,c = 1.1 (epidemic near containment) and k c = 0.7 (blue), R o,c = 1.1 and k c = 0.15 (magenta), R o,c = 2.5 (typical of countries with strong initial intervention) and k c = 0.7 (green). The other parameters of the logistic functions are R o,u = 4.5 and t 50 = 1.5/\u03b3. contradicting this revised analysis. This finding supports the view that a global 237 convergence to an uncontrolled R o = 4.5 is a more likely explanation than a power-law 238 alternative arising from a non-linear force of infection in an SIR framework. To be clear, 239 there are other causes for power-law solutions (e.g. a stochastic \u03b2 as discussed 240 elsewhere [31]), but those fall outside the domain of deterministic SIR approaches 241 adopted here. Nonetheless, and as a bridge between the studies reporting power-law 242 growth in time for I and the modified SIR here, a relation between m and a is sought. 243 The solution to equation 10 can be expressed as 244 i(t) = i(0) 1\u2212m + \u03b2(1 \u2212 m)t 1/(1\u2212m) , (11) 245 which is a power-law in t. For dimensionless time \u03b3t >> (i(0) 1\u2212m /[R o (1 \u2212 m)], 246 i(t) \u223c t 1/(1\u2212m) (m < 1). It directly follows that m = (a \u2212 1)/a\u00a11 (as expected), where 247 a > 1 is determined by regressing early-times log(i) versus log(t). Reported a for what 248 has been termed as 'explosive' cases such as the US, UK Canada, Russia, among 249 others [29] all yield an a > 8 (with the US a > 16). Such high a simply confirms that 250 m \u2248 1 (and without much variations), and the early time SIR dynamics does describe 251 reasonably those cases. For low a values, termed as 'steady', the mean a \u2248 4.8), and 252 thus yields an m \u2248 0.8, still not too far from unity. The shortcoming of analyzing I(t) 253 upon t is that absolute figures of I(t) are sensitive to increased COVID-19 testing in 254 time, which is considered next. 255 Impact of testing ramp-up 256 A further explanation of early-time deviation from the SIR model (noted in several data 257 sets here) may be time-dependent ramp-up of testing, which reveals existing infections 258 at a rate faster than the infection spread. This hypothesis can be implemented in the 259 SIR model considering the temporal dynamics of the testing capacity, f . Assuming the 260 maximum fraction of individuals that can be tested is f = 1 and testing capacity grows 261 at a rate k, independent of I, gives, f (t) = 1 \u2212 exp (kt). Therefore, the apparent 262 number of infections, i a , initially grows according to the superposition of the infectious 263",

The most significant 278 use of R o is an estimate of the size of the epidemic. The total fraction of infected 279 individuals may be inferred from 1 \u2212 S(\u221e)/S(0), where 280 S(\u221e)/S(0) = 1 \u2212 R(\u221e)/S(0) > 0 because I(\u221e) = 0. The relation between S(t) solution requires solving a transcendental equation for S(\u221e)/S o , which can be 286 achieved numerically. For pre-specified R o , the total fraction of infected individuals is Relation between total infection fraction 1 \u2212 S(\u221e)/S o and R o . As of March 5, 2020, global mortality estimates from COVID-19 by the World 291 Health Organization (WHO) are at \u03b1 m = 3.4% virtually identical to the current USA 292 value (as of April 8, 2020; Confirmed cases = 428,901 and Mortality = 14,600). For the 293 USA, now the epicenter of COVID-19, we ask how much R o should be reduced by 294 deliberate intervention to maintain mortality below a certain threshold size M o . With 295 S(0) = 327M, we determine how much R o should be reduced as a function of M o 296 assuming \u03b1 m = 3.4%. These results are featured in Figure 8 and suggest that to 297 maintain mortality below 1 million, R o < 1.15, a factor of 4 reduction over its 298 uncontrolled value. 299 A natural extension of this exercise is to consider temporal changes in R o following 300 the logistic form in equation 6. The maximum number of infected I max at time t and 301 cumulative number of infections R(\u221e) \u2248 R(\u03b3t \u2248 14) can be made to vary as the slope 302 k c and t 50 are changed (equation 6). A larger k c signifies more rapid enforcement of 303 intervention policies and a larger t 50 represents later enforcement. To provide a physical 304 meaning for k c , we define t fo as the time after first infection at which R o is f o % of the 305 way through its total decline from R o,u to R o,c . With these definitions, 306 t fo = t 50 + log[f o /(1 \u2212 f o )]/k c . An obvious choice for R o,u = 4.5, the global average 307 when no intervention is enforced. A logical choice for f o = 80% and is consistent with 308 the point at which the logistic function enters the 'flattening phase'. We choose 309 R o,c = 1.0 to represent the most optimistic scenario of a near-containment by 310 intervention. For reference, the South Korea data suggests that early intervention, even 311 when rapidly enforced shortly after the outbreak, resulted in R o = 1.5 [32]. The 312 effectiveness of interventions and any delays can now be converted to mortality and 313 severity by varying t 50 and t 80 on R(\u03b3t \u2248 14) and I max as shown in figure 9. These 314 figures present how R(\u03b3t \u2248 14), a number connected to the cumulative number of 315fatalities, and I max , a number representing the degree to which existing resources (i.e., 316 hospital beds will be overwhelmed), are contained for only a restricted envelope of speed 317 and timeliness of policy enforcement. The results inFigure 9indicate that if R o > 2.7 318 within t = 3.5/\u03b3 (about 49 d here), a > 10% reductions relative to S o in I max or R(\u221e)",

This R o was shown to describe reasonably the 338 maximum initial exponential growth rate of COVID-19 (=(R o \u2212 1)\u03b3, where 339 \u03b3 = (1/14)d \u22121 ) in many countries that did not initiate preventive measures within 340 \u03b3t = 2. The findings here further supports the growing consensus that the initial 341 R o = 2.2 estimate from Wuhan, China are low. The value of R o = 4.5 is much more in 342 line with other estimates (R o = 4 \u2212 6) derived from far more complex models.",

The SIR model makes a number of assumptions, including a closed system with no changes in natural births or natural deaths occurring 67 during the short-lived outbreak. The infection is assumed to have negligible latent period so that an individual becomes infectious when infected. Disease transmission occurs through individual-to-individual contact directly (skin-to-skin), indirectly 70 (skin-infected surfaces), or airborne (pathogens transmitted through air by small particles after coughing or sneezing). Recovering from infection is also assumed to confer long-term immunity, yet to be verified for COVID-19. The most objectionable",
