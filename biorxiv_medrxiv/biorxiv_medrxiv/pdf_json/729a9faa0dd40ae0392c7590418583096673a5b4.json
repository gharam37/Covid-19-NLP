Here we propose a simple model based on exponential infectious growth, but with a timevarying, largely damping, transmission rate. This model provides an excellent fit to the existing data from the 102 countries and regions which have reported cases for more than 6 days, and, we think, has largely captured the transmission patterns of the COVID-19 outbreak under a variety of intervention and control measures. We found that the damping rate, defined as the rate of the exponential decline in transmission rate, ranged from -0.125 to 0.513 d -1 globally (a negative damping rate represents acceleration in spread). The estimated peak time (when the fastest spread occurs) and the final number of infections were found to be greatly affected by the damping rate. Successful control measures, such as those implemented in China and South Korea, have resulted in a clear pattern of exponential damping in the viral spread (also shown during the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS). The damping rate, therefore, could be used as an indicator for the efficacy of implemented control measures. Our model suggests that the COVID-19 outbreak is currently accelerating worldwide, especially rapidly in certain countries (e.g. USA and Australia) where exponential damping is yet to emerge. Consistent with the message from the World Health Organisation (WHO), we thus strongly suggest all countries to take active measures to contain this global pandemic. Slight increments in the damping rate from additional control efforts, especially in countries showing weak or no exponential damping in COVID-19 transmission, could lead to a radically more positive outcome in the fight to contain the pandemic.",

Due to the excessively high rate of human-to-human transmission, the virus has quickly spread across all provinces of China and all countries of the world (3). In order to contain this outbreak, governments and healthcare authorities across the globe have taken a series of strict public health measures. Wuhan and all major cities in Hubei, for instance, were sealed off, human movement and traffic prohibited, quarantine imposed on all potentially exposed people, makeshift hospitals quickly built to receive and cure for infected patients. After implementation for just one month, these control measures effectively contained the spread of this highly infectious novel coronavirus in China (4), and were considered therefore highly efficient by the World Health Organization (WHO)(5). As the first wave of the pandemic has passed beyond China, COVID-19 now begins to rage worldwide, sweeping across all continents except Antarctica (6). For effective monitoring and containment of the pandemic, it is crucial to understand the patterns of its rapidly changing and localised transmission and promptly evaluate whether the currently implemented control measures are adequate to 'flatten the curve'.",

We found that the transmission rates of COVID-19 in these three countries were all declining exponentially over time, with South Korea experiencing the highest damping rate, similar to that of China (around 0.16 d -1 ), while the other two countries lagged behind at a much lower damping rate, especially Italy (Fig.2 ). Using the current exponential function of the transmission rate, we estimated the peak of COVID-19 spread at 18 March 2020 (95% We further calculated the damping rate for all 102 countries and regions that have reported 7 or more days of infection, from which we also estimated the peak time since All rights reserved.

To illustrate our model, we first compiled the daily numbers of COVID-19 infections from the website of the NHCC (www.nhc.gov.cn) for the period of 10 January to 3 March 2020 in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, and the whole of China. Evidently, our model provided an excellent fit to the data, unveiling a clear pattern of COVID-19 transmission (Fig.1). The transmission rates in Wuhan, Hubei (but excluding Wuhan), and the rest of China outside Hubei, all began to decline exponentially at around the same damping rate (about 0.16 d -1 ) after the large-scale control measures implemented by the Chinese authorities from 23 January (red lines in the left panels of Fig.1). Exponential damping was more obvious outside Wuhan after 12 February (at a rate of 0.32 d -1 ; see the blue lines in the left panels of Fig.1). Such exponentially damping patterns have accurately captured the spreading dynamics of COVID-19 in China (see right panels of Fig.1), and thus could be considered a reliable monitoring indicator of the effectiveness of those control measures implemented in other global regions for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak.",

There were strong negative relationships between thedamping rate and the peak time since first infection (black open circles in Fig.3b), and between the damping rate and the final number of infections (black open circles in Fig.3c). In countries with low damping rates, the slight increase in the damping rate by 1\u2030 or 5\u2030 could drastically reduce the peak time (blue and green open circles, respectively, in Fig.3b) and the final number of infections (blue and green open circles, respectively, inFig.3c). In countries with high damping rates, such minor increments in the damping rate have trivial effects(Fig.3b-c).For the entire world outside China, the spread of COVID-19 has been increasing exponentially at a constant transmission rate (0.17 d -1 ) with its damping pattern yet to emerge (the damping rate is close to zero; see the two bottom panels inFig.2). The pandemic (excluding China) can only be contained if global control efforts, especially with extra efforts in countries showing no clear signs of exponential damping, can suppress the transmission rate ( ) to decline by a sufficient damping rate (see red lines inFig.3b-c). To contain the disease by the end of 2020 (one new case every 10 days) in the world (excluding China), we need to reduce the current transmission rate with a clear exponential damping rate of a=0.057 d -1 , with the estimated peak time in 11",

To this end, control measures from countries and regions that have already shown exponential damping in their transmission rates could be communicated and compared by the WHO for better local disease control worldwide. Additional control measures should be implemented in countries showing no signs of exponential damping; however, slight improvement of the current control measures can bring about drastic improvement on outbreak control in countries already showing weak exponential damping in transmission. Globally, our analysis suggests that an additional control effort to bring a minimum damping rate of 0.057 d -1 is needed to effectively control this COVID-19 pandemic below 4 million infections within 2020.
