Then, we mapped those similarity matrices into networks where nodes represent Italian regions and edges represent similarity relationships (edge length is inversely proportional to similarity). Then, network-based analysis was performed mainly discovering communities of regions that show similar behaviour. Then, network-based analysis was performed by running several community detection algorithms on those networks and by underlying communities of regions that show similar behaviour. The network-based analysis of Italian COVID-19 data is able to elegantly show how regions form communities, i.e. how they join and leave them, along time and how community consistency changes along time and with respect to the different available data.",

From the northern regions of Italy, the disease spread very quickly to the nearest regions and then to the rest ones. Italy has considered one of the main epicentres of the pandemic recording a number of infected equal to 97689 and a number of deaths equal to 10799 up to 29rd of March. In this paper we want to underline difference at regional level and to evidence how the disease has spread along time. To do this, both statistical and network-based analysis on Italian COVID-19 data has been performed. The data are daily provided by the Italian Civil Protection, and they refer to the period February 24 to March 29, 2020. In particular, we analyzed the Italian COVID-19 data at the regional level in order to evaluate which regions show a similar trend. Then, for each type of data, we built the related networks where the nodes represent the Italian region, and the edges represent a level of similarity among them. Finally, we evaluate how the networks evolve over the weeks up to the end of March 2020. The main contribution of the the paper is a network-based representation of COVID-19 diffusion similarity among regions and graphbased visualization to underline similar diffusion regions. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the Italian COVID-19 data, the statistical and network-based analysis, Section 3 discusses the results, Finally, Section 4 concludes the paper.",

Since p-value was less than 0.05 for each distribution, we decided to use nonparametric test for the following comparison. As initial step, we used the Wilcoxon Sum Rank test to carry out an analysis within the same type of data for all weeks and then, for each single week. The Wilcoxon test is a non parametric test designed to evaluate the difference between two treatments or conditions where the samples are correlated. The Wilcoxon test performs a pair-wise comparison among regions with the goal to evidence which ones show different trend. For this reason, we built a similarity matrix for each couple of regions, for each of the available COVID-19 data.

It is to notice, the network structure changes according to the analyzed time interval. At the end of 35th day, the network has all nodes connected with exception of a single node that represent the Basilicata region. Furthermore, it is possibile to highlight different community structures consisting of groups of regions with similar trends. Figure 12 (a) reports five communities: the first one consists of Basilicata; the second one is composed by Piemonte, Marche, Emilia, Lombardia, Veneto; the third one is composed by Liguria, Lazio, Toscana; the fourth one is formed by Campania, Puglia, Sicilia, Abruzzo, Valle d' Aosta, Friuli, Trento, Bolzano; the last one is composed by Umbria, Sardegna, Calabria, Molise. Figure 3 represents the evolution of Intensive Care network. It is possible to notice that Lombardia and Veneto, that are the most affected region by Coronavirus disease with high number hospitalised in Intensive Care Units, are disconnected in the first week. In the second week, Lombardia and Veneto are connected by an edge that represents a level of similarity, whereas in the fifth week Veneto is linked with Emilia and Lombardia and this group of regions becomes a disconnected component among with other regions. Thus, while initially Lombardia and Veneto showed a similar trend of Intensive Care data, after Veneto moved far from Lombardia trend. Furthermore, by analyzing the communities in the Intensive Care network (Figure 12 (b)), it is possible to evidence four subgraphs formed by (i) Lombardia and Veneto, (ii) Umbria and Lazio, (iii) Marche, Emilia, Piemonte, Toscana and (iv) a large module formed by Campania, Sicilia, Sardegna, Abruzzo, Umbria, Calabria, Basilicata, Bolzano, Valle d'Aosta, Friuli, Trento, Molise. Figure 4 show the Total Hospitalised network evolution. Starting form the first week, the structure of the network has two disconnected nodes representing Lombardia and Veneto, whereas in the second week the network evolves by presenting a single disconnected node that represent Emilia, and two connected nodes, Lombardia and Veneto, which in turn are disconnected from dense subgraph. In the third and fourth week the network structure presents all connected components, and high number of nodes result disconnected in the fifth week. Finally, all re-gions are connected in the final network. By analyzing the communities detected in Total Hospitalised network (Figure 12 (c)), it is possible to notice a similarity with those extracted by Hospitalised with Symptoms networks. In fact, there is a correspondence among three communities: (i) Basilicata and Piemonte, (ii) Marche, Emilia, Lombardia, (iii) Veneto and Liguria, Lazio, Toscana. This means that those regions that form the tree communities present the same behaviour according to the number of the hospitalised patients with symptoms and the total number of hospitalised patients. Figure 5 shows the evolution of Home Isolation network over five weeks. In first week, Lombardia, Veneto and Emilia show a different trend of the number of subjects in isolation at home, both them and also compared to other regions. Next, in the network resulting by considering the all weeks, Lombardia, Veneto, Emilia and Marche formed a subgraph disconnected by a different dense subgraph composed by the rest of the regions. However, Veneto represents a single community in Figure 12 (d). This means that the behaviour of Veneto presents a low similarity respect to Lombardia, Emilia and Marche despite forming a module. It is possible to notice that: Lombardia, Veneto, Emilia form a community in both Total Currently Positive network and New Currently Positive network, Piemonte represent in sigle community in Total Currently Positive network and while Piemonte is associated with Marche and Toscana in New Currently Positive network. Figure 8 represents the Discharged/ Healed network over the five weeks. In the first week, the network structure present all nodes connected with exception of Veneto. In the second week, Discharged/ Healed network is formed by three subgraphs; in the third and fourth weeks the network results very dense; in the fifth week is caracterized by different disconnected components, and finally, at the end of 35 days the network is composed by a subgraph composed by Lombardia and Veneto and another subgraph highly connected. This means that Lombardia and Veneto have a similar behaviour that it is different by the rest of the Italian regions. Also Lombardia and Veneto represents one of the five communities extracted by Discharged/ Healed network. The extracted communities are reported in Figure 12 (g). Figure 9 shows the evolution of Deceased network. The evolution of this network is different by other Italian COVID-19 networks. In fact, in first week all nodes are disconnected, so all Italian regions present 7 All rights reserved.

In the third week all nodes present connections. In the fourth and and fifth week the Deceased network presents different disconnected components, then, the final network shows a single disconnected node that represents Basilicata. Also the Basilicata represents a single community of Deceased network, see Figure 12 (h). The others extracted communities are: (i) Piemonte, Toscana Liguria, Lazio, Friuli, Puglia, Valle d' Aosta, (ii) Lombardia, Veneto, Emilia, Marche, (iii) Sicilia, Molise, Abruzzo, Umbria, Campania, Trento, Bolzano, Calabria, Sardegna. Figure 10 represents the Total Cases network over the five weeks. The final network evidences that the Italian regions present a significant level of similarity respect to the number of total Coronavirus cases because all nodes are connected.

In fact they are the Italian regions that initially performed high number of test swabs. Also, Veneto region has not connections in the final network and this reflects the policy of the Veneto to carry out swab tests on asymptomatic subjects, i.e. it is an outlier with respect to other regions.

We identified similar Italian region with respect to the available COVID-19 data and we mapped these ones in different networks.
