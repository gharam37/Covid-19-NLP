Using the power law scaling we analyze the data of different countries and three states of India up to 1st April, 2020 and explain in terms of power law exponent. We find significant reduction in growth of infections in China and Denmark (\uf067 reduced from approximately 2.18 to 0.05 and 11.41 to 6.95, respectively). Very slow reduction is also seen in Brazil and Germany (\uf067 reduced from approximately 6 to 4 and 11 to 7, respectively). Infection in India is growing (\uf067=9.23) though lesser in number than that in the USA (highest \uf067 of 16 approximately, studied so far), Italy and a few other countries. Among three Indian states the growth in West Bengal (\uf067=0.64) is much slower than other states like Maharashtra and Kerala (\uf067=3.23 and 3.32, respectively). Some future predictions, though not rigid, has also been incorporated in our analysis. The earlier lock-down and stricter measures from the Governments concerned are being thought to be the only possible solutions, in the present situation, to fight against this virus.",

Although outbreak carries the same meaning of epidemic, but generally is used for more limited geographical area. However, pandemic is completely different from both the terms on the basis of the outbreak area and affected people as defined in [1] . It generally spreads over several countries or even continents impacting very large number of people. Pandemic is often caused by novel or new virus or new strain of virus [1] . The disease spread out from the novel virus is generally dangerous owing to the lack of human immunity. The Spanish flu in 1918-19 and H1N1 in 2009 are concrete examples of some of the deadliest pandemics. The former killed almost 40 million people globally infecting a quarter of the then global population. 2009 H1N1 flu was another example that infected about 163258 people (confirmed case), though the mortality rate was small (only 18036 was confirmed by World Health Organization) [2, 3, 4, 5] .",

However, all the Governments have uniformly accepted that due to the non-existence of vaccines or globally accepted medications at present, lock-down and social distancing could be the solutions to save the countries from uncontrollable infections. Some countries e.g Denmark, Norway and South Korea have significantly reduced the rate of infections by the interventions like emergency lock-downs, and social distancing much earlier than other countries [8] . Under these circumstances it is important to understand the characteristics of the COVID-19 infections, the rapidity of its spread and recovering from the ailments concerned.",

            "text": "Simple mathematical models may be used at present to understand grossly the trend of the already observed infections, as well as to predict its future behavior. At the very moment, there is tremendous need of predictive models or formulae to understand the extent of global spread in the near future so that effective and efficient plans could be adopted in different sectors of medical field and Government policies. Recently, two approaches have been used to estimate the infection rate. The SIR (susceptible infected recovered) model for the spread of infectious disease primarily has been used to predict the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases [9, 10] . Besides, logistic models [11, 12] , time series modeling [13] etc are also used for the same. Another approach is to use some simple models like power law, exponential and parabolic (t 2 ) scaling of growth etc. Among these, power law model is stated to be free from some errors as seen in exponential growth and parabolic growth models [8, 14, 15] , and it is represented by: where, \uf067 is the power law exponent and A is constant. The estimation of the exponent (\uf067) in the power law is done by fitting the available data on the total number of infected persons as a function of time. The value of \uf067 signals the rapidity of the spread of disease in a country or region. Sengar [8] found that the number of confirmed cases had reached a plateau or saturation (new infection reported becomes zero) in China. Except China, severe reduction in new confirmed events is found only in a few other countries such as Denmark, Norway and South Korea but not collapsed to zero so far as the time span is concerned, Senger performed the calculations up to 24th March, 2020 to see whether there was significant reduction in the exponent (\uf067) during the Government intervention and if the emergence of saturation in the number of infection could be imminent [8] . In the present work, we have done the same type of calculations for several countries but extending the date up to 1st April, 2020 to examine the value of the exponent and to find out the effect of Government intervention in the prevention of the pandemic. Apart from India as a whole, we have also performed calculations for its three states, viz. Kerala, Maharashtra and West Bengal, separately. Short term future prediction has also been incorporated in the present work.",

In only a handful of countries, e.g Denmark, South Korea and Norway the stages A and B are prominently visible without any sign of stage C [8] . Only China is showing the stages A and C. The stage C or saturation comes just after the end of the growth stage. For majority of the countries the initial growth of the disease is very rapid and as the Government intervention comes into effect the log-log plot moves to the power law region or stage A. We have excluded a few points at the very beginning during this rapid growth in the straight line fitting in our work. The value of the exponent at stage A is termed as pre-intervention exponent (\uf067 pre ) and that at stage B or C is termed as post-intervention exponent (\uf067 post ). Till now the co-existence of stages B and C have not been found for any countries we have analyzed. log-log scales, respectively. In our work we have also found that in Germany ( fig. 4) and Brazil (not shown in figure) the saturation stage has just been started. The \uf067 post =6.95\uf0b10.08 is lesser than \uf067 pre =11.41\uf0b10.14 in Germany . But the reduction of \uf067 post is not as severe as that of China or even Denmark. Thus it is not confirmed whether true saturation region is actually started there or it is simply a daily fluctuation of the data. The prediction of the total number of infections is shown in fig. 3 taking \uf067 post =6.95 and also by taking \uf067 post same as that of Denmark for the best case scenario.

However, the extent of infection in terms of confirmed number of infected persons is lower in comparison to those of other countries such as the USA (highest \uf067=15.91), France or Italy, if we take into account the larger population of India. However, the citizens should also come forward actively and efficiently to help materialize successful implementation of Government policies by adhering the Government rules. However, one thing is certain, as commented in earlier work [8] , that earlier and stricter lock-down aided by general public co-operation may reduce the infection rapidly as shown by China, South Korea and Denmark. The effect of lock-down in India may be visible in the next few days, affecting the value of the exponent of the power law scaling. Similar case is also seen for the states studied for the country India. West Bengal is one of the Indian States where lock-down started from as early as 14th March, 2020. It may be one of the reasons for the slower growth in infection in West Bengal in comparison to other states. In case of the USA, largest value of \uf067 is really unexplained. But we have found a ray of hope. The USA data of last 5 days may be showing reduction in \uf067 (from 15.91 to as small as 9), though the number of data points is very small to comment.",

The spread in the number of infections are also studied in the three states (Kerala, West Bengal and Maharashtra) of India separately. The common trend is the initial rapid growth stage of infection with time and then the reduction of rate due to the intervention of the respective Governments. In China, the actual saturation in the new events has been found. The pre and post saturation exponents \uf067 are found similar to earlier work. Denmark, Brazil and Germany show reduced post saturation exponent \uf067 indicating the appearance of stage B. The German and Brazilian data may have showed the post-intervention effect due to Governmental policies with \uf067 pre and \uf067 post being different. The data on infected persons show that India still has not reached stage B. The stricter Government interventions may be visible in the data later. We have predicted the short term number of confirmed infected patients in best case (\uf067 post same as that of Denmark) and in worst case scenarios (\uf067 post same as of Germany) for India along with the trend due to present value of the exponent. Similar prediction has also been done for Germany. The German data set is interesting as it is probably entering in the stage B or slow down stage. Among the three Indian states, the rate of infection is found very small in West Bengal in comparison to that in Maharashtra and Kerala.

The reduction of \uf067 is significant that may indicate the faster and stricter Government measures and adherence of rules by the citizens. Similarly, we estimated the exponent \uf067 for Germany, France, Brazil, Denmark and India. Our intention is to check how much changes could be found in the data within a few days of the earlier published work and also to investigate whether saturation stage comes into effect in any countries other than China.Earlier it was found that there was rapid reduction in the rate of number of infected persons only in China, Denmark, South Korea and Norway. However, except China, the perfect saturation stage of infection could not be seen in the rest of the countries corroborated by the higher values of post-intervention \uf067 in comparison to that of China. The \uf067 post was found nearly zero in China. For Denmark, we found \uf067 post as 1.48 similar to the earlier work.
