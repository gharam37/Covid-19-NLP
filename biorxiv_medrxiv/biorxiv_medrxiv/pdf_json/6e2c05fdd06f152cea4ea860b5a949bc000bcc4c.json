Single particle cryo-EM excels as an imaging technique to solve static structures of proteins, but existing computational 3D reconstruction methods for cryo-EM data have not been effective in practice for solving structures or modelling motion of flexible proteins. We introduce 3D variability analysis (3DVA), an algorithm that models the conformational landscape of a molecule as a linear subspace, and is able to fit the model to experimental cryo-EM data at high resolution. 3DVA makes it possible, for the first time, to resolve and visualize detailed molecular motions of both large and small proteins. Through extensive experimental results on cryo-EM data, we demonstrate the ability of 3DVA to resolve multiple flexible motions of \u03b1-helices in the sub-50 kDa transmembrane domain of a GPCR complex, bending modes of a sodium ion channel, five types of symmetric and symmetry-breaking flexibility in a proteasome, and large motions in a spliceosome complex. We also show that 3DVA can uncover discrete conformational states of heterogenous mixtures of ribosome particles from a single sample. The results demonstrate that 3DVA enables new biological insight to be extracted from single particle cryo-EM data. 3DVA is implemented in the cryoSPARC software package, and has already been used successfully in several notable structural studies.",

Single particle cryo-EM collects thousands of static 2D protein particle images that in aggregate span the target protein's 3D conformational space. Cryo-EM therefore holds great promise for studying protein dynamics [21] . However, there are significant computational challenges in resolving dynamics from static image data, particularly in the presence of continuous heterogeneity. These stem from the need to simultaneously estimate the canonical structure of the molecule, the one or more ways in which the structure can change (due to motion, dissociation, etc), and the specific state of the molecule in each single particle image. These problems are exacerbated by the high levels of noise in the imaging process and the need to also estimate, for each particle image, the CTF corruption and 3D coordinate transform between the 3D model the 3D pose of the particle.",

Each observed single particle image X provides a CTF corrupted, 2D projection of the 3D structure V at a single point on the manifold. The true manifold in the general case may have a complex, nonlinear geometry. However, for many molecules of interest, a linear subspace model provides a simple but effective way to represent the 3D structures present in a cryo-EM sample. To this end, a K-dimensional linear subspace represents all possible 3D structures in the sample as the sum of a base structure V 0 and a weighted combination of K components, V 1:K \u2261 {V 1 ...

            "text": "The weight vector, z = (z 1 , ..., z K ), is a per-particle latent variable representing the conformational state of the molecule. This class of subspace models, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multivariate Statistical Analysis (MSA), or eigenanalysis, has been discussed extensively in the literature (e.g., [1, 28, 42, 44] ). They are attractive for their simplicity, their analytical properties, and the existence of relatively stable numerical methods. However, methods for fitting linear subspace models are not widely used in practice compared to K-way discrete 3D classification methods [12, 36, 38, 39] . This is due to the inability of existing methods to estimate the components and weights in Equation (1) at moderate or high resolutions or to do so for several components simultaneously. This makes it difficult to resolve detailed conformational changes that are most important at high resolutions. This paper describes an effective new algorithm for fitting accurate high-resolution 3D linear subspace models to single particle cryo-EM data, and shows that it yields remarkably useful information about flexible dynamics and heterogeneity of the target molecule. We refer to this specific algorithm for cryo-EM as 3D Variability Analysis (3DVA). Through experimental results we show that 3DVA allows for directly resolving molecular motion, flexibility, changes in occupancy, and even discrete heterogeneity of a wide range of protein molecules. In particular, it resolves high resolution flexibility, with motions of individual \u03b1-helices as small as a few\u00c5, for both large and small proteins. To our knowledge this is the first method to work on small proteins; for example, we are able to visualize three different types of flexible motion of the small sub-50 kDa transmembrane region of a GPCR complex, at a resolution of \u223c3\u00c5-4\u00c5.",

Recently proposed deep generative models [48, 49] have also been experimentally demonstrated to resolve continuous and discrete heterogeneity, but for large motions at coarse resolution, and only for large complexes (spliceosome and ribosomes, all in the multiple-MDa size range). 3DVA provides similar insights on these same datasets, but it is 20-50x faster to train and requires no manual parameter tuning or hyperparameter optimization for individual datasets.",

The linear subspace model can be constructed and understood in another way as well.

This avoids the missing information problem in 3D, but can only operate at low resolutions where the dimensionality of \u03a3 is still tractable, and it further suffers from statistical inefficiency due to the random noise injected into each bootstrap sample. Together these drawbacks limit the method to resolving only very coarse resolution eigenvectors of large complexes [28] . Some techniques have been proposed that make further simplifying assumptions about the form of \u03a3, reducing the effective dimensionality so that the entire matrix can be estimated.

Instead, each particle image is explained by a combination of the components, and in general, several variability components may together represent the physically independent motions and changes in the molecule. Figure 1 shows an example of a variability component on a simple ribosome dataset. Variability components solved by 3DVA will often capture flexible motion of the underlying molecule in a sample. Figure 1 (right) shows qualitatively how a linear subspace model will capture motion of an object. The model is a good approximation for an object that is moving a distance similar to its own size. Small objects moving large distances are less well modelled. In other words, 3DVA can represent large motion in low resolution regions of a 3D density map, and can model detailed small motions in high resolution regions.",

Figure 1 shows an example of reaction coordinates along a single variability components for a ribosome dataset, as a 1D histogram. Across a population of particle images, the mean value of each reaction coordinate will be zero, since V 0 itself best explains the average particle. The variance of each reaction coordinate across the population (known as the eigenvalue) indicates the importance of that component in describing the data. Components with large variance explain the most variability in the particle images. When a population of particle images contains well-separated clusters of different conformations, 3DVA components will identify the differences between clusters, and the reaction coordinates of particles will also be clustered providing direct insight into discrete heterogeneity in the dataset.

The third component resolves a twisting motion where the middle and ends of the barrel both rotate around the symmetric axis. The final two components are asymmetric (Figure 6a, right) , resolving bending of the entire barrel in two different directions (detail of component 4 in Figure 6c ).

Nevertheless, the linear subspace model underlying 3DVA is limited in its ability to faithfully represent large motions (Figure 1 ), and so a simple local weighting strategy can be used to create intermediate 3D reconstructions along each variability component. Particles are weighted based on their position along each reaction coordinate (Figure 7a , bottom) and 3D reconstructions are created using those weighted particles. This type of local neighborhood weighting is commonly used in manifold embedding applications generally, and has been used previously in other methods for manifold embedding of cryo-EM data (e.g. [6] ).

First, a simple Variational Autoencoder (VAE) [17] is trained to reduce the 4-dimensional reaction coordinates to a 1-dimensional embedding of particles where individual clusters can be directly visually identified. The VAE is constructed using PyTorch [27] , with a single hidden layer of size 1024 in both encoder and decoder architectures. Training was completed in 2 minutes for 40 epochs. The result of training the 1-D VAE is shown in Figure 8c as a histogram of particle positions. The peaks correspond to the multiple discrete states and the outlier cluster detected by GMM fitting (shown using the same colors as Figure 8b ). This result can be directly compared with the 1-D Spatial-VAE embedding carried out in processing of this same dataset using the cryoDRGN deep generative model [48] , where a similar histogram is generated that resolves four major sub-states in the data, plus one outlier cluster. A second non-linear dimensionality reduction technique, UMAP [23] is applied to the 4-dimensional reaction coordinate results (Figure 8d ) displaying the geometry of clusters in the 4-dimensional space, for example that clusters 2, 4, and 7 are sub-clusters of a larger cluster. This result can again be compared with the corresponding results in [48] . This result is notable as it shows the power of 3DVA to resolve nuanced discrete conformational heterogeneity, despite the apparent simplicity of the linear subspace model. 3DVA algorithm does not require tuning or hyperparameter optimization for individual datasets to which it is applied.",

The variability component is colored in red and blue to indicate negative and positive values respectively. The variability component captures the change to be made to the base density to explain heterogeneity in the dataset; density should be decreased in red regions and increased in blue regions. A histogram (bottom) shows the distribution of the amount of the variability component present in each particle image, also known as a reaction coordinate. Right: Synthetic examples of how a linear subspace model like 3DVA resolves motion of objects in the data. In both cases, the top row depicts 11 positions of the object observed in the data. The bottom row depicts the resulting variability components and the image generated by the linear subspace model at the same 11 positions.
