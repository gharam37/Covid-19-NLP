Elevated levels of ultra-sensitive troponin I, myoglobin, D-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate, decreased albumin level, depressed PaO2 and SpO2 demonstrated impaired organ functions of lung, heart, liver as well as coagulation disruption on admission (Table 2 ). There were several differences of laboratory parameters between patients who died within 3 days and those survived 3 days of admission. Patients died within 3 days of admission had significantly higher white blood cell count (10.8 vs 6. (Table 2) . Compared with patients survived 3 days of admission, those died within 3 days had longer prothrombin time (13.2 vs 12.5 s, P=0.040) and higher D-dimer concentration (7.64 vs 2.82, P=0.040). Blood gas analyses showed patients died within 3 days presented with significantly lower oxygen saturation (85.0% vs 91.0%, P=0.008) and higher lactate level (2.9 vs 2.2 mmol/L, P=0.042) compared with those died after 3 days which reflected poor oxygenation in these patients (Table 2) . Chest CT scans were used to evaluate the features of lung injury. Patients suffered severe lung damage and their lung imaging features presented vast or merged glass shadow, but quantification of lung injury revealed no significant difference between patients died within 3 days and those died after 3 days of admission (Table 2 and Figure 1 ).
