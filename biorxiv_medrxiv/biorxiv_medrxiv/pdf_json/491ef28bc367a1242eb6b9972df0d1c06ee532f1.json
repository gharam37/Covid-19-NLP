This paper presents a simple theoretical model focussed on the implications of the wide range in interaction rates between individuals, both within the workplace and in the social setting. The model is based on well-mixed populations and so is not intended for studying geographic spread. The model shows that epidemic growth rate is largely determined by the upper interactivity quantiles of society, implying that the most efficient methods of epidemic control are interaction capping approaches rather than overall reductions in interaction.",

The theoretical model suggests that with no intervention herd immunity would be achieved with a lower overall infection rate than if variation in interaction rate is ignored, because by this stage almost all the most interactive members of society would have had the infection; however the overall mortality with such an approach is very high. Scenarios for mitigation and suppression suggest that, by using interactivity capping, it should be possible to control an epidemic without extreme sanctions on the majority of the population if R0 of the uncontrolled infection is 2.4. However to control the infection rate to a specific level will always require the switching on and off of measures and for this reason eradication is likely to be a less costly policy in the long run. While social distancing alone can be used for eradication it is not be a good mechanism on its own to prevent reinfection. The use of robust testing, quarantining, and contact tracing would strengthen any social distancing measures, speed up eradication, and be a better tool for prevention of infection or reinfection.",

In this paper, a totally theoretical probability-based approach is taken, which treats the population as a whole, and which specifically addresses variation in social interaction of individuals, with the aim of understanding how different human agents contribute to the spread. This model is not useful for studying geographic spread and, because it does not have any regional granularity, it is cannot address specific questions of how to deal with households or institutions, though in principle the model could be considered for institutions as approximately independent units, where infection rates are low. The purpose of the model is not to replace fuller simulation or network based studies but to provide a model which is simple enough for nonspecialists to use and which can be used to understand why some strategies might be more effective than others.",

The amount of interaction any individual has in a complex modern society will vary over a very wide scale, and probably over a wider scale than contact survey data would suggest. This is partly due to the upper limit on the number of contacts reported, either because the respondent cannot remember them, or because they do not necessarily think they are significant. For the purposes of this model the number of contacts is, in any case, not as significant as total one-one contact time for virus transmission.",

At the upper limit will be those who spend most of their day in close proximity to four other individuals in crowded spaces (ca. 50 person hrs/day), and at the other end of the scale, people who only have close interaction very rarely when doing essential errands, or those living alone who are rarely visited (ca. 0.5 person hrs/day). Whether contact within the household is considered is a difficult question, because households are particularly integrated. It might be better to consider each household as a superindividual -so with extra interactions and greater chances of picking up the infection together; this issue will not be addressed here, but obviously is within the simulation studies. The exact numbers are not important but the variability is, and here it is assumed that there is likely to be a 95% probability range of about two orders of magnitude in t. The distribution f (t) will be estimated to be log normal (using the estimates above, the median would be ca. 5 person hrs/day).",

While this is numerically correct, the very strong weighting to high t values makes this highly dependent on the upper limit of interactivity, and because there are practical limits to this, if the upper value of t is capped at the 2\u03c3 level this is reduced to R0 = 2.4t which may be more realistic.

Initially these are seeded with a probability of infection set for the particular model run. Using the t values for each quantile the expected number of potential infections can be calculated directly for the population as a whole.

The actual infection probability for each quantile is then reduced by the proportion of that quantile which has already been infected.",

This gives at of 0.995 and a median value of t of 0.558. All outputs are expressed in cycles of infection, following the logic of this simple model; in the case of COVID-19 this is expected to correspond roughly to weeks. In practice with a distributed population, everything would be expected to lag more than this model would suggest. It is also important to note that the parameter modelled here is new infections, symptoms will lag this and detected cases (especially if they are on hospitalisation) will lag further, and deaths, further still. This model is best suited to looking at endemic infection within a single integrated population. The initial seed infection rate probability is chosen to be 0.0001 which is the level at which it is very obvious you have an issue; the seed infection is assumed to be distributed in proportion to individuals interactivity which fits with the overall logic of this model. For many of the scenarios it is useful to further split the population into groups with different interventions. For those cases, in this paper three groups have been used: 60% in group 1, 20% in group 2, which is assumed to be vulnerable, and 20% in group 3, which are assumed to be key workers and therefore not subject to some sanctions. Where mortality is discussed, this is assumed to be 0.5% for groups 1 and 3, and 5% for group 2; this gives an IFR of 1.4% overall which is the upper limit of what is expected [6] .",

In order properly to take account of this it is necessary to consider the very wide range of levels of interaction that individuals have through choices they make, and the jobs that they do. A very simple model of infection propagation demonstrates that it is much more efficient, when considering interventions to reduce the growth rate of an epidemic to below 1, to target interventions at those activities that result in the very highest interaction levels, and specifically for people who are engaged in those on a regular basis. There is a non-linearity in the system which implies that limiting upper levels of interaction will work more effectively than reducing interactions across the population as a whole. If we can equate lost interaction time with societal cost there is something like a 50% reduction in the cost in taking this approach.",
