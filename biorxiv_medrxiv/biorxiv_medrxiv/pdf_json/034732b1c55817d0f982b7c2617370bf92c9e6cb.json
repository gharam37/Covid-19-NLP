The Hopkins team published the first case report and case series suggesting that sudden olfactory dysfunction, should be considered highly suspicious for SARS-CoV-2 [4, 6] . Moreover, our study group recently showed, that anosmia was present in 86% in a series of 417 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease, and appeared before other symptoms in 11.8% [5] . In the same way, Kaye et al. described in a series of 237 patients that anosmia was noted in 73% of subjects prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and was the initial symptom in 26.6% [11] . In a larger series of 1,420 mild to moderate COVID+ patients, our Bayesian analysis identified that reported anosmia was a key symptom in COVID-19 infection with 70.2% of cases (Lechien et al., submitted).",

            "text": "nasal inoculation of coronavirus HCV209 in 20 volunteers[12]. They showed that in individuals with a cold(9 volunteers)  and impaired olfaction, the change of smell ability was correlated to nasal obstruction. Based on Akerlund et al. study patient reported symptoms suggesting that COVID-19 infection provokes nasal obstruction, we hypothesized that this could explain the anosmia[12]. However, although a significant proportion (49%) of our patients reported nasal obstruction, the majority did not, suggesting neural mechanisms are also involved.In 2007, Suzuki et al. demonstrated that coronavirus may be detected in the nasal discharge of patients with olfactory dysfunction [13], and that some patients had normal acoustic rhinometry, suggesting that nasal inflammation and related obstruction were not the only etiological factors underlying the olfactory dysfunction in viral infection. Netland et al. demonstrated on transgenic mice expressing the SARS-CoV receptor (human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2) that SARS-CoV may enter the brain through the olfactory bulb, leading to rapid transneuronal spread [14]. Interestingly, authors demonstrated that the virus antigen was first detected 60 to 66 hours post-infection and was most abundant in the olfactory bulb. Recently, Gupta et al. performed a bioinformatic analysis of single-cell expression profiles underscored selective expression of angiotensin coverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a subset of horizontal basal cells and sustentacular cells of the olfactory mucosa in humans [15]. They evaluated the expression of ACE2 transcript in 3,906 olfactory mucosa originated single cells from the recent report by Durante et al. [16] and suggested that loss of smell in the infected patients is most unlikely due to the direct impairment of the olfactory sensory neurons; in particular the sustentacular cells and the horizontal basal cells are the potential cell types that are highly susceptible to viral entry.",
