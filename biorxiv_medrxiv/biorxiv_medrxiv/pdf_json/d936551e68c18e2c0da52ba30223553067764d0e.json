Due to multifacet issues and challenges in implementation of the 16 safety & preventive measures, inconsistent coordination between societies-governments and 17 most importanly lack of specific vaccine to SARS-CoV-2, the spread of Wuhan originated virus 18 is still uprising after taking a heavy toll on human life. In the present study, we mapped several 19 immunogenic epitopes (B-cell, T-cell, and IFN-gamma) over the entire structural proteins of 20 SARS-CoV-2 and by applying various computational and immunoinformatics approaches, we 21 designed a multi-epitope peptide based vaccine that predicted high immunogenic response in the 22 largest proportion of world's human population. To ensure high expression of the recombinant 23 vaccine in E. coli, codon optimization and in-silico cloning were also carried out. The designed 24 vaccine with high molecular affinity to TLR3 and TLR4, was found capable to initiate effective 25 innate and adaptive immune response. The immune simulation also suggested uprising high 26 levels of both B-cell and T-cell mediated immunity which on subsequent exposure cleared 27 antigen from the system. The proposed vaccine found promising by yielding desired results and 28 hence, should be tested by practical experimentations for its functioning and efficacy to 29 neutralize SARS-CoV-2.",

A significant increase in the level of IFN gamma, IL-10, IL-23, 367 and IL-12 was also observed at subsequent exposure (figure 6). After the repeated exposure of 368 vaccine construct through 12 injections after a regular interval, a remarkable increase in the 369 level of IgM+IgG, IgG1+IgG2. Though, IgG1 increased slightly but IgM and IgG2 increased 370 consistently. A surge in the memory corresponding to B cell and T cells was observed 371 throughout the exposure while the level of IFN gamma was consistently high from first to last 372 exposure (figure S4). This signifies that the vaccine proposed in this study has generated a strong 373 immune response in case of short exposure and immunity increases even on subsequent repeated 374 exposure.375Discussion376The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan city of China raised several questions regarding 377 the susceptibility of Humans against these novel pathogens. As predicted earlier about the re-378 emergence of novel variants of SARS-CoV [54], SARS-CoV-2 proved to be more lethal as 379 compared to the previous variants in terms of wide spread of virus in a short period of time. This 380 escalated rate of transmission initiated a pursuit for a vaccine development against SARS-CoV-381 2, which is currently a worldwide pandemic with over 1.43 million cases and 85, 711 deaths [1]. 382 With strict and comprehensive measures, vaccine development and its application could play a 383 key role in eliminating the virus from the Human population or to restrain the spread among 384 individuals and different populations. Thus several efforts are being made to address the 385 challenge that appeared in the current scenario with appreciable advancements in the 386 understanding of virus biology and its etiology. The lack of knowledge regarding the response of 387 the immune system against viral infection is one of the major limitations in the path of vaccine 388 development for SARS-CoV-2. 389 This study is the piolt attempt in describing the potential immunogenic target over the structural 390 proteins and proposes a novel multi-epitope vaccine construct, by providing new rays of hope in 391 the initial phase of vaccine development. Certain criteria like poor antigenicity, allergenicity, low 392 affinity towards the immune cells, autoimmunity and oversize that could influence the suggested that the Envelop protein is the most potent protein to generate 396 immune response considering its role in viral assembly. Since, immunity against any pathogen is 397 prominently dependent, how it gets recognized by B cells and T cells. We identified epitopes 398 corresponding to B cells and T cells in each structural protein so that both humoral and cellular 399 immunity can be induced with the exposure of vaccine construct. The proposed vaccine construct 400 is designed based on the epitopes that have been selected with the most robust criteria,e.g. their 401 nature of antigenic, non-allergic, 100% conserved among the target proteins, their affinity for 402 multiple alleles, no homology with any of the human proteins, their worldwide coverage of 403 human population (>50% of worldwide population covered) and effective molecular interaction 404 with their respective HLA alleles. Further,, IFN gamma epitopes which are equally effective in 405 immune regulatory, antiviral and antitumor activities, the final vaccine construct was designed 406 with also due considering of the IFN gamma epitopes to increase the immune recognition ability. 407 The designed vaccine of 430 amino acid residues has a molecular weight of 45.131K Da, also 408 falls in the defined range of average molecular weight of a mullti-epitope vaccine. The instability 409 index and theoretical PI also suggested that the vaccine is stable and basic in nature and the 410 estimated half-life suggested that the recognized peptide does not possess a short half-life and 411 would remain viable for a span adequate to generate a potential immune response. Vaccine 412 model refinement and validation indicated that quality of the predicted model was good as more 413 than 90% residues were in the favored region [55]. The B-cell continuous epitopes predicted 414 over the surface of the vaccine suggested that the vaccine is capable to get recognized by B-cells 415 indicating its effectiveness. TLR 3 and TLR 4 have proven recognition capability in both SARS-416 CoV and MERSCoV. Considering the similar genome characterization of SARS-CoV and 417 SARS-CoV-2, the molecular interaction of vaccine with TLR 3 and TLR 4 through docking 418 analysis suggested that the constructed vaccine has a significant affinity towa rds the toll-like 419 receptors to act as sensor for recognizing molecular patterns of pathogen and initiating immune 420 response. Thus the vaccine TLR complex is capable of generating an effective innate immune 421 response against SARS-CoV-2.

The consistent high level of IFN gamma also supported the activation 429 of humoral immunity. To understand the immunogenic potential of vaccine, repeated exposure in 430 the form of 12 injections was administered and the result suggested the consistent generation of a 431 strong immune response. With all these immunoinformatics approaches, the vaccine designed 432 against SARS-CoV-2 showed promising results in inducing immune response. 433 Without proper control methods or vaccines, it is difficult to curb coronavirus pandemic given 434 the current situation. However, several medications have been tested against SARS-CoV-2, but 435 none of them showed complete effectiveness. In this study, a vaccinomics approach was carried 436 out to design a multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 using several in silico and 437 immunoinformatic approaches. Based on the computational and immunoinformatics approaches, 438 we propose that the designed vaccine has all the potential to induce both the innate and adaptive 439 immune systems and can neutralize the SARS-CoV-2, and therefore, an experimental validation 440 of the designed vaccine must be undertaken by the professional for reaching a conclusion for its 441 safety, efficacy and success. 442 Acknowledge ments 443 We thank Zoological Survey of India, Kolkata for providing access to the computational support, 444 working space and facilities to undertake the present study. on-the-second-meeting-ofthe-international-health-regulations-(2005) 456 emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novelcoronavirus-(2019-ncov) 457 (accessed on 29 March 2020). 458 5.
