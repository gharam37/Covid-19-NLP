This study reveals differences in the rate of disease spreading rate over time in different countries. This survey observes that most countries undergo a beginning exponential growth phase, which transitions into a power-law phase, as recently suggested by Ziff and Ziff. Tracking indicators of growth, such as the power-law exponent, are a good indication of the relative danger different countries are in and show when social measures are effective towards slowing the spread. The data compiled here are usefully synthesizing a global picture, identifying country to country variation in spreading, and identifying countries most at risk. This analysis may factor into how best to track the effectiveness of social distancing policies and quarantines in real-time as data is updated each day.",

            "text": "Mathematics is essential to predict and control the course of a pandemic. One approach is mathematical modeling [1] . Many epidemiological models derive from the SIR (susceptible, infected, recovered) model [2] or some more sophisticated versions of it. If there are susceptible, infected, and recovered (or removed individuals), then there are standard shaped curves and predictions you can make based on differential equations, provided you exactly know the transmission rate and recovery rate. These parameters may only be possible to determine from a retrospective analysis. One parameter is R 0 , the basic reproduction number, which represents the number of people an infected person typically can infect over their progression. Clearly, if R 0 is much larger than 1, then there is a significant initial exponential growth of cases that sweep through most of the population. China and South Korea have mostly blocked the spread of COVID-19 by enacting social policies and testing so R 0 can definitely be reduced or modulated. The SIR equations are also entirely deterministic, while in real systems, there is some stochastic element of variation. SIR equations do not have an analytical solution so they are more difficult to solve, and determining the fitting parameters requires sophisticated statistics. Usually for an epidemic like the flu everything stays open so the parameters are more or less the same over the entire trajectory of the analysis. Things start to become very complicated if different countries enact different social policies over time with different degrees of strengths. SIR model parameter themselves would then become functions of time complicating the analysis. Spreading the virus may also depend on differences in geography, social networks, social dynamics, or individual behaviors.",

The data analysis follows the proposal of Ziff and Ziff [3] , where an early stage involves exponential growth, and a middle stage exists where there is power-law growth. The power-law exponents allow us to make reliable short term predictions of a few days of the worst-case scenarios in hot spot countries compared to that of the usual assumption of exponential growth.

If the curve stays in a power-law regime, the plot of the exponent is flat versus time. That would be the latest overall exponent. It will also reduce in magnitude as the rate of infections decreases. The data from China and South Korea follow this pattern and do not fit a power law for all times because an end-stage of no new infections occurred.

Since most countries will not exhaust their populations for some time from March 28, 2020, then D as a function of time looks very similar to just \u03b2 as a function of time, so I choose not to plot it or report the values.

The Hubei province data is the most interesting because it shows an entire trajectory of the infection. There is one problem with China Hubei province data. The criteria for a positive test was extended to include lung imaging on February 13. Discontinuities from differences in testing recording are bad for a moving window analysis that we use. Instead, as an example, we make an interpolating function, which is a logistic curve. We can see what the moving window method predicts as a basic model on ideal data where testing would have been perfect. For all other analysis in this paper, we assume no interpolating function. Also the other China datasets with better measurements for different provinces look like the same progression of beta as we show in figure 3 for this toy model. In summary, we should keep in mind the dropping of beta to zero is what we want to happen as the outbreak comes under control in different countries. If beta is increasing that indicates things are getting worse.",

The dependence of \u03b1 does not appear to indicate anything useful for the time being. The powers seem to vary between zero and just over five for the US, which is currently the epicenter. Perhaps this has to do with general behavior and connectedness of society rather when the disease first hit the country. The extrapolation of the power-law should enable us to make short term predictions of the number of cases in the future; however, social distancing measures can drop the power as indicated by measurements in South Korea and China. In those situations, the crossover occurs when \u03b2 starts around 2 and takes three weeks or more from the point it starts to reduce. For the case of the US, this might take longer since the exponent is now near 5. log-log plots with the top scaled to the population of the country give some indication of how long a worst-case scenario could last before more or less everyone is infected. in the case, of the US this could be 100 days or less without mitigation.
