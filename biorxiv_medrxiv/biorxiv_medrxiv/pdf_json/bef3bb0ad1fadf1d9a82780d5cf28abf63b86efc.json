We investigate SARS-CoV-2 genome responsible of the new deadly COVID-19 pandemic for the theoretical possibilities to engage intra pairing within the viral RNA and also hybrid pairing with human transcriptome. Segmental pieces of RNAs that originate from SARS-CoV-2 were computationally searched as a potential source of one strand, the complementary strand being from the host transcriptome. We therefore considered perfect complementarity of host RNA with any piece of SARS-CoV-2 RNA as a collection of theoretical siRNAs potentially Dicer substrates. Few human genes seems targeted by SARS-CoV-2 RNA, among them mitochondrial deubiquitinase USP30 and a subunit of ubiquitin protein ligase complex FBXO21 could explain premature death of infected cell by the collapse of mitochondria.",

More frightening, many people that are infected don't present clinical signs, which helps its spread, making it likely endemic for a long time. A minority of people (about 15% of infected) endures degraded conditions requiring intensive care unit for treatment. The virus presently spreads throughout the world and could end up with the death rate of 2-3% of infected population. Metagenomic RNA sequencing along with the phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome from a sample of broncho-alveolar lavage fluid of a patient infected by so called 'Wuham coronavirus' (now referred to as SARS-CoV -2) have been performed [1, 2 ] . These analyses have shown that this strain is very close to a group of SARS like coronaviruses previously found in bats in China [1, 2] . The high homology of the predicted protein of the RBD domain of the spike protein with the precedent SARS-CoV hints that the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) acts as a receptor for fixation and entry to human host cells [3, 4] . The cell entry is a multi-step process ordered cascade of events that involves viral attachment to the cell surface, receptor binding, protease processing and endocytose.",

Usually viruses are rapidly detected in host cells by receptors that acts as sensors of foreign nucleic acids. In fungi, plants and invertebrates, the viral dsRNAs are trapped and cleaved by Dicer/ago machinerie into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that degrade the targeted viral messenger RNAs within the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) by a base pairing mechanism [5] . In mammals/humans the detection of virus-derived small RNAs has been mainly undetectable upon RNA virus infection [6] . Human unique Dicer processed long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and hairpin dsRNA into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs respectively but its role as producer of antiviral RNAis is yet far to be admitted by many authors. However, mammalian viruses were successfully eliminated and replication inhibited in cultured host cells via synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) [6] . All these elements are in accordance with the fact that viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces a powerful and non-sequence-specific synthesis of interferon (IFN), which appears as the major molecular weapon to fight mammal RNA viruses [7] .",

The question whether RNA virus infection of mammalian cells can trigger an effective and powerful antiviral RNAi weapon remains unknown and little documented as no siRNAs of viral origin were experimentally found in mammal infected cells in contrast with in plants and invertebrates [8] . The absence of virus specific siRNAs in mammal cells remains presently a puzzling observation for which an explanation could be the scarcity of intra RNA pairing offered by the virus genomes. In light of their evolutionary success to replicate in mammal host through genetic innovation, RNA viruses have developed mechanisms of avoidance of host immunity/defense by masking their own RNA sequences or sheltering away from the cytosol and/or receptor sensors in order to escape the battlefield leading to their own degradation.",

            "text": "In the past weeks we urgently proceeded to a computational search of the SARS-CoV-2 full RNA sequence to explore whether short readings presenting perfect match in reverse complementary strand with RNA candidates from the full human transcriptome might exist. We also examined the possibilities of intra or inter pairing within the full SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Comparative studies were conducted with the SARS-CoV, the MERS-CoV along with two non-virulent coronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43). The purpose of these searching was guided by the hypothesis that hybrid duplex RNA (one strand from human transcriptome, the other from SARS-CoV-2) could be theoretically formed and consequently might lead to degradation of RNA targets not only in SARS-CoV-2 but more importantly, the other way around, in the human transcriptome. Regarding the length of pairing that qualifies substrates for Dicer, the known biochemistry data documents that a 25-or 30-base pairing length is not necessary for loading onto Dicer and subsequent activation of Ago2 in the RISC complex (although some conflicting reports exist about the structural basis and activity of Dicer) [10] [11] [12] . Dicer can trap dsRNAs pairing over a 19-base length with at least a 2 nt overhang at the 3' end and can then directly transfer the modified/unmodified siRNA to the Ago2 site. This has been demonstrated with fluorometric dsRNA [13] . Some paired 19-mers with a dTdT overhang at the 3' end bind Dicer with high affinity; these sequences are not cleaved by Dicer, are fully transferred to Ago and trigger high-efficiency gene silencing activity [10, 11] . Dicer also binds single RNAs at a specific site with high affinity, the function of which is to accelerate hybridization with a partner from the \"soup\" of RNA metabolism [14] . The newly in situ-formed dsRNA, which is asymmetric, slides into the endonuclease site for cleavage, and the processed RNAi product is transferred successfully into RISC complex. Authors have shown that the pairing length can be as short as 16 nt, with a several-base overhang at the 3' end to fully bind to Dicer and consecutively activate Ago in the RISC context [10] [11] [12] . In this study, a pairing length for computational searching was set minimally to 20 bases, which leads to 24 mers considering the 2nt overhang in both 3' extremities. Rare candidates were found above 20 bases length considering perfect match.",

USP 30 is a mitochondrial deubiquitinase involved in mitochondria homeostasis functions, one of which being to counter the Parkin mediated mitophagy [15] . USP 31 is known to increase the activity of the transcription factor NF kappa B (NF-kB), strongly involved in interferon (IFN) synthesis [16] . Interestingly, mitochondria shelter MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling proteins), known to stimulate an interferon-dependent signaling pathway which orchestrate antiviral response in mammals [17] . SARS-CoV-2 might affect mitochondria via ubiquitination alteration, which could be a plausible pathway of interference to explain the dramatic deteriorating conditions of some patients affected by this virus.",

A study has shown that an extensive presence of dsRNAs in the Drosophila and C. elegans by high-throughput sequencing involving many categories of RNA included mRNAs and in which miRNA and lncRNA populations appear as a minority component [30] . The extreme severity of COVID-19 regarding the clinical impact in human heath resides in the co-evolution virus/homo sapiens. Amazingly the absence of intra RNA pairing in SARS-CoV-2, the protection of viral genome in de novo synthesized pseudo organelles by host membrane invagination in which the dsRNA during replication by the RNA dependent RNA polymerase is sheltered from degrading host cellular process, make these viruses an evolutionary success to escape and evade RNAi/Dicer/Ago weaponry. Host cells are sensing RNA virus infection by internal receptors. The first pathway of innate immunity receptors is orchestrated by Toll like receptors (TLR3). The second pathway is related to retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs). Both pathways converge to produce interferons (IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2) and p ) and proinflammatory cytokines via NF-kappa B and IRF-3 transcription factors [31] [32] [33] . Upon RNA viral infection, the RNA helicases (RIG-I and MDA-5) binds virus-derived RNAs. The complexes then translocate at the outer mitochondrial membrane to bind with MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling). The bound MAVS acting as scaffold protein recruits downstream effectors to form a \"MAVS signalosome\" of which the major function resides in drastically inducing the stimulation of the NF-UB and IRF-3 factors [34] . Mitochondria appear to constitute an hub of communication/transmission in the line of cascade of antiviral defense events [34] . Regarding the humans genes targeted by SARS-CoV-2, we observe the presence of USP30 a deubiquitinase specific of mitochondria and FBXO21which is a subunit in an ubiquitin protein ligase complex.",

The pairing are identified at the junction between exons 17 and 18 of DNAJC13, into exon 10 of ELP4, exon 12 of FBXO21, exon 2 of FLRT2, exon 13 of USP30, exon 16 of USP31 and exon 4 of ZNF443.In SARS-CoV-2, the sequences are originating from 3 putative open reading frames (orf): orf1a/b, Spike and orf3b. In a recent study,Chan et al.,  show that there are no remarkable differences between orf1a/b in SARS-CoV-2 with the one in SARS-CoV[20], the major distinction being located in orf3b, Spike and orf8. The authors note that orf3a encodes a completely novel short protein that may have a role in viral pathogenicity. Orf3a also include the 20-base sequence that potentially targets ubiquitin specific peptidase 30 (USP30). The sequence of 20 bases, originating from orf3a of SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to target the sequence AAAGATAGAGAAAAGGGGCT which is shared by 15 predicted and/or found transcripts of USP30. In parallel the SARS-CoV-2 fragments that match with USP31, FLRT2, FBXO21 were found in only 5, 4 and 5 isoforms (predicted or experimentally found) respectively. The level of all these human proteins could be affected by this RNA duplexing. Regarding the USP30, the data gathered by the \"1000 genomes project\" shows that this 20 bases sequence is present in all Homo Sapiens with the exception of 0,49 % of Han Chinese in Bejing that have a mutation A/T in 2nd position within this matching sequence[21]. On the other side, this sequence in USP30 was not found in other mammal species (those for which the genome is available).2: list of hybrid duplex RNA potentially formed with one strand from human transcriptome and the other from SARS-CoV.

Regarding the no virulent coronavirus (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43), a unique pattern of few human genes are targeted by a 20 bases sequences of viral RNA. Among these genes, an half expresses no coding RNAs for which a perturbed role by viral aggression is difficult to assess. The few coding genes do not appear to qualify for GO annotation of cellular signaling susceptible to be altered by the virus infection. These coding genes are SSH1 (Protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in actin filament dynamics in cellular lamellipodia formation), PTP4A1 (Protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in progression G1-S mitosis), GCNA (protein with acidic domain involved in genome stability. Mutants accumulate DNA-protein crosslinks resulting in chromosome instability), COX11 (a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, that catalyzes the electron transfer from reduced cytochrome c to oxygen) and finally SRGAP1 (GTPase activator involved in neuronal migration) (see NCBI database for information). 4: list of hybrid duplex RNA potentially formed with one strand from human transcriptome and the other from HCoV-229E.
