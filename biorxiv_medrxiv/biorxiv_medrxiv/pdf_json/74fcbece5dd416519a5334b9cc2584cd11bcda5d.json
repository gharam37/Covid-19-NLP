The MRR can be interpreted as percentage increase in the COVID-19 death rate associated with a 1 \u07e4 g/m 3 increase in long term average PM 2.5. The MRR from the main analysis is adjusted by seventeen potential confounders (population density, percent of the population >65, percent living in poverty, median household income, percent black, percent Hispanic, percent of the adult population with less than a high school education, median house value, percent of owneroccupied housing, population mean BMI, percent ever-smokers, summer/winter temperature/relative humidity, and number of hospital beds for each county, and number of COVID-19 tests performed for each state). In secondary analyses, we (a) omit number of hospital beds; (b) omit number of tested cases in each state; (c) omit smoking rate and BMI from BRFSS; (d) omit summer/winter temperature/relative humidity; (e) exclude data from New York state; (f) exclude data from counties with less than 10 confirmed cases.

That is, we found that an increase long-term average PM 2.5 is associated with a statistically significant increase of 15% in the COVID-19 death rate. This suggests that in New York County (Manhattan) if we were to lower the long-term average analyses shown inFigure 2, we (a) omit number of hospital beds from the adjustment set (b) omit number of tested cases in each state from the adjustment set (c) omit smoking rate and BMI from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from the adjustment set (d) omit summer and winter temperature and relative humidity from the adjustment set (e) exclude data from New York state (f) exclude counties with less than 10 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The results of these analyses are consistent with the main analysis, except when the number of hospital beds is omitted from the adjustment set. In that case, the point estimate decreases, and statistical significance is attenuated. This suggests that number of hospital beds is a strong confounder.",
