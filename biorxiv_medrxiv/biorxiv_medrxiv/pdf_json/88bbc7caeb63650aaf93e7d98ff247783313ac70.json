Here, we present an optimized freeze-25 drying procedure that allows SARS-CoV-2 PCR mixes to be transported and stored at 26 ambient temperatures, without loss of activity. Additive-supplemented PCR mixes were 27 freeze-dried. The residual moisture of the freeze-dried PCR mixes was measured by 28 Karl-Fischer titration. We found that freeze-dried PCR mixes with ~1.2% residual 29 moisture are optimal for storage, transport, and reconstitution. The sensitivity, 30 specificity, and repeatability of the freeze-dried reagents were similar to those of freshly 31 prepared, wet reagents. The freeze-dried mixes retained activity at room temperature 32 (18~25\u2103) for 28 days, and for 14 and 10 days when stored at 37\u2103 and 56\u2103, 33 respectively. The uptake of this approach will ease logistical challenges faced by 34 transport networks and make more cold storage space available at diagnosis and 35 hospital laboratories. This method can also be applied to the generation of freeze-dried 36 PCR mixes for the detection of other pathogens. 37 38",

Both 45 infected persons and asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 are likely sources of new 46 infections [4, 5] . Timely diagnosis and management are essential for disease control. Real-47 time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is an accurate and 48 sensitive molecular technique and is considered the \"gold standard\" for the diagnosis 49 of COVID-19 [6, 7] . 50 However, to maintain bioactivity, PCR reagents must be transported and stored at 51 a low temperature. This presents challenges to already overburdened transport logistics 52 networks and cold storage space at diagnosis and hospital laboratories. 53 Freeze-drying (lyophilization) is a low-temperature dehydration process mainly 54 used for stabilizing of heat-labile biological drug substances contained in aqueous 55 solutions [8] . Because water drives many destabilization pathways, removing most of the 56 water can prolong the shelf-life of the product [9, 10] . Because freeze-dried reagents 57 typically contain all of the necessary components for testing (at appropriate 58 concentrations), errors associated with improper handling of wet reagents can also be 59 reduced. This reduces preparation time and, thus, testing throughput. 60 There have been several recent publications investigating the possibility of freeze-61 drying PCR mixes. Klatser et al. freeze-dried PCR mixes for the detection of 62 mycobacterium, which could be stored at 4\u2103 and 20\u2103 for 1 year and at 56\u2103 for 1 63 week [11] . Tomlinson et al. freeze-dried PCR mixes for the detection of Phytophthora 64 ramorum, which could be stored at room temperature for 20 weeks.

Based on this finding, we 203 propose that this method can now be transferred to other PCR mixes, changing only the 204 primers and probes. 205 206 3.4 Sensitivity and repeatability of the lyophilized reagents 207 In these rRT-PCR assays, a 10-fold dilution series of nucleic acid was used as the 208 reaction template. Each freeze-dried reagent was reconstituted in 35 \u00b5l of nuclease-free 209 water before adding 5 \u00b5l of the sample, whereas the wet reagent reactions were made 210 up of 35 \u00b5l of freshly-prepared PCR mix and 5 \u00b5l of the sample. The amplification 211 efficiencies and Ct values were similar when comparing the freeze-dried reagent and 212 wet reagent, while the fluorescence intensity of the freeze-dried mixes was lower than 213 that of the wet reagent (Fig. 3A-C). Our assay was sensitive at template concentrations 214 of 10 -5 , but not at 10 -6",
