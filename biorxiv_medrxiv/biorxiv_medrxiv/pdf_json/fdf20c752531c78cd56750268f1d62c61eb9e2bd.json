The catastrophic socio-economic impacts of this intervention could outweigh its benefits if the timing and duration of implementation are left uncontrolled and ill-strategized. Here we investigate the dynamics of social distancing on age-stratified US population and benchmark its effectiveness in reducing the burden on hospital and ICU beds. Our findings highlight the diminishing marginal benefit of social distancing, characterized by a linear decrease in medical demands against an exponentially increasing social distancing duration. We determine an optimal intermittent socialto-no-distancing ratio of 5:1 corresponding to ~80% reduction in healthcare demands -beyond this ratio, benefit of social distancing diminishes to a negligible level.",

Until March 2, the total number of confirmed active COVID-19 cases in the US were 33, with new cases emerging in states of Texas, Arizona, Wisconsin, Illinois, Florida, New York, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts (8) . In the following two weeks, this number has rapidly increased to 527 confirmed cases on March 9, and then to 4,216 cases on March 16 (8) . State of California and New York have respectively declared state emergency on March 4 and 7 (9, 10) . The White House declared national emergency on March 13 (11). Thus, major outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic across the US is inevitable. As of March 27, the total number of confirmed cases in the US has exceeded 100,000, surpassing that in China and Italy (8) . The US-CDC asserted that the progression of COVID-19 in the US is still in its acceleration phase, with the epidemic peak yet to arrive (7) . To prevent the rapid disease spread and meet the medical demands, social distancing has been adopted as a non-pharmaceutical measure across the country. Such a non-pharmaceutical intervention aims to slows down epidemic progression, and ultimately prevents the country's medical system from collapsing due to overburdening of COVID-19 patients. However, its effectiveness and cost benefits as a function of implementation duration, timing, and strategy, especially in the context of COVID-19 epidemic, remain uncertain. Here, we comprehensively investigate the effectiveness of various social distancing practices, as well as their implementation strategies, on the reduction in the peak demand of medical resources, such as hospital beds and ICU beds (12) .",

The trends in (a) and (b) also imply that the arrangements with identical distancing-to-normalcy ratio ( \u2044 ) tend to achieve the same outcome. This observation is further elucidated in Fig. 4 (c), wherein the reduction in medical demands is plotted as functions of the characteristic \u2044 ratio. The diminishing marginal benefits of social distancing is again observed here. Up to 80% reduction in medical demands can be achieved with a \u2044 \u2248 5.

Our baseline scenario represents a continuation of the epidemic dynamic between March 19 and 28, during which a rapid surge of COVID-19 cases is observed in the United States and the effect of social distancing is yet to manifest. Our finding suggests that under such a baseline condition, the statewise hospital and ICU beds could be overwhelmed by up to 12 and 35 times, respectively. A wholesale social distancing could balance the medical demand-to-supply at epidemic peak provided a 70% percent reduction in the time-of-exposure of the population within all age-groups is achieved. Marginal benefits of social distancing wane over time, characterized by a linear decrease in medical demand against exponentially increasing social distancing duration. We therefore suggest an intermittent social-to-no-distancing arrangement, which could reduce the medical demands by up to 80% provided the duration of social distancing is less than or equal to five times of the recurring normalcy period. Findings from this study may also apply to other regions of Europe, as well as Asia, where social distancing measures have been in effect to slow the epidemic spread. .

(b) Same plot for nationwide ICU bed demandto-supply ratio (\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd). Symbol \"A\" marks a \"weekday-like\" arrangement comprised by intermittent five-day normalcy and two-day social distancing. Symbol \"B\" marks a \"biweekly working arrangement\" comprised by intermittent five-day normalcy and nine-day social distancing. (c) Percent reduction in medical demands is plotted as a function of distancing to normalcy ratio, \u2044 .",
