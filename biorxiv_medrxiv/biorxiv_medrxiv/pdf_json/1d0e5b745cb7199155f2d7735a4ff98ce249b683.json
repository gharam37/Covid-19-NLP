As for the drivers of the rapid 18 evolution, it's partly due to their coevolution with transposable elements (TEs). But 19 their diverse functions besides inhibiting TEs suggest other reasons exist.

Generally, KZFP contains a KRAB domain and a C-terminal C2H2 45 zinc finger array with DNA-binding potential (supplementary fig. 1 ). Both C2H2 zinc 46 finger and KRI (KRAB Interior) motif, which is the ancestor of KRAB domain (Birtle 47 & Ponting, 2006) , are old motifs, appearing widely across animals, plants and fungi. 48 However, these two kinds of motifs did not appear in the same protein during the 49 lengthy process of evolution until their 'marriage' in the last common ancestor of 50 coelacanths and tetrapods (Imbeault, Helleboid, & Trono, 2017) about 400 million 51 years ago. After that, the KZFP family expanded and diverged quickly especially 52 during the evolution of mammalian. 53 The phenomena of the rapid evolution of KZFP family include three aspects: (1) 54 The strong specificity of KZFP family across species. Lots of species-specific KZFP 55 genes were reported in human, chimpanzee and other species (Huntley et al., 2006;  The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.041848 doi: bioRxiv preprint 9 these KZFPs are completely structured ( fig. 2C ), suggesting that they have a single 166 and unchangeable function execution pattern and constantly interact with a specific 167 co-factor (such as KAP-1). In another evolutionary path, the key amino acids in the 168 zinc fingers are conserved (that is, KZFPs containing old zinc fingers). However, the 169 KRAB domains of these KZFPs are variable and tend to be disordered ( fig 2C) , 170 suggesting that their KRAB domains are versatile, interacting with multiple proteins. ; supplementary table 4) . 214 Furthermore, we confirmed that MACS2 used in this study is more accurate than ",

Different from the classical 28 regulation pattern of this family, we found and experimentally confirmed that KZFPs 29 tend to bind to non-TE regions and can positively regulate target genes. Although 30 most young genes tend to be with a low expression level, 31 young-zinc-finger-containing KZFPs tend to be highly expressed in early embryonic 32 development or early mesoderm differentiation, indicating their particular 33 evolutionarily novel functional roles in these two processes. We further validated a 34 young KZFP, ZNF611, can bind to non-TE region of STK38 gene and positively 35 regulates its expression in ESCs.

The previous studies found that KZFP can inhibit endogenous 74 retroelements during early embryonic development (G. Wolf et al., 2015) and 75 embryonic stem cells (D. Wolf & Goff, 2009), even in adult tissues (Ecco et al., 2016). 76 Furthermore, a lot of data indicated that there is a coevolution between zinc fingers in 77 KZFP family and transposable elements (TEs) (Ecco et al., 2017; Jacobs et al., 2014; 78 Thomas & Schneider, 2011). There are two co-evolution models: (1) the arms race 79 model (Jacobs et al., 2014), in which KZFP proteins unremittingly suppress the 80 invasion of rapidly mutating TEs via changing the key amino acids of zinc fingers; 81 and (2) the domestication model (Ecco et al., 2017; Pontis et al., 2019), in which 82 KZFPs regulate domestication of TEs instead of restraining the transposition potential 83 of TEs. Thus, the regulation of TEs is an important driver for rapid evolution of the 84 KZFP family. However, KZFPs also have many other functions besides repressing 85 TEs (Baudat et al., 2010; Grey et al., 2011; Grey, Baudat, & de Massy, 2018; Guo et 86 al., 2009; Kang et al., 2012; X.

Even so, the 152 middle-aged KRAB domains still account for the largest proportion in this variant 153 cluster. This phenomenon suggests that these variant KRAB domains were formed 154 gradually, rather than concentrated in a specific period of evolution. 155 When the divergence time of zinc fingers was considered, among these 35 156 KZFPs, 23 of them (65.7%) contain old zinc fingers (the divergence time is over 159 157 Mya) (fig. 2A). If we calculated using the number of KZFPs containing old zinc 158 fingers as the denominator, 67.6% (23/34) of KZFPs with old zinc fingers contain 159 variant KRAB domains (fig. 2A). These two results revealed that there is a large 160 intersection between the old-zinc-finger-containing KZFPs and the KZFPs with a 161 variant KRAB domain. In other words, KZFPs with evolutionarily conserved zinc 162 fingers tend to have a variant KRAB domain. This suggest there are two different 163 ways for the evolution of KZFPs.

But after all, KZFPs with variant KRAB domains or old zinc 175 fingers are only a small part. For the entire KZFP family, KRAB domains tend to be 176 completely structured although they are absolutely young domains (supplementary fig. 177 3F&3G; supplementary result). Furthermore, at protein level, KZFPs are also highly 178 structured, suggesting that most of KZFPs are monotonous and unchangeable in 179 structural conformation and functional mechanism (supplementary fig. to analyze the diversification pattern of zinc figures in human, the 182 similarity of zinc fingers based on three key amino acids within each zinc finger in 183 human KZFPs were calculated. As the result, the similarity between most zinc finger 184 pairs are very low (fig. 2D, supplementary table 2), only 153 (0.23%) KZFP pairs 185 have similarity value over 0.6 (fig. 2E). Furthermore, by identifying the homologous 186 relationship of human KZFPs, we found that only 121 (33.3%) KZFPs belong to 44 187 paralogous gene groups, while 242 (66.7%) KZFPs are singletons (fig. 2F). These 188 results indicate that the key amino acids in KZFP zinc fingers are diverse. 189 Overall, from the above results we can infer that the most and diverse zinc fingers, suggesting their targeting sequences may 194 also evolved quickly, which acted as drivers for the quick evolution of zinc fingers. 195 KZFPs tend to bind to non-TE regions in exon and promoter 196 In order to analyze the functional differences of KZFPs with different 197 evolutionary features and explore the reasons for the rapid evolution of the KZFP 198 family, the target gene information of KZFP should be investigated. To this end, we 199 collected ChIP-seq or ChIP-exo data of 262 KZFPs (supplementary file). An 200 important function of KZFPs is to bind and inhibit transposable elements (TEs), 201 especially retroelements (Ecco et al., 2017; P. Yang, Wang, & Macfarlan, 2017), and 202 there is a co-evolution model between KZFPs and TEs (Jacobs et al., 2014; Thomas & 203 Schneider, 2011). To comprehensively analyze the genome-wide TE-binding tendency 204 of KZFPs, we analyzed the KZFP binding sites in various regions of the genome. For 205 a KZFP, if over half of the KZFP peaks binding to TEs in a region, the KZFP is 206 identified as the KZFP tending to bind to TEs in this region and vice versa. Based on 207 this standard, we found over half of KZFPs tend to bind to non-TE regions in genome 208 (fig. 3A; supplementary table 3). And more interestingly, around 90% of KZFPs tend 209 to bind to non-TE regions in exon, UTR and promoter (fig. 3A; supplementary table 210 3). However, according to the result of two previous studies, KZFPs tend to bind to 211 TEs in genome (Helleboid et al., 2019; Imbeault et al., 2017). We found that main 212 reason for this difference is the different versions of MACS program used in the 213 ChIP-seq data processing (supplementary results",

To test this speculation, we analyzed the binding bias of KZFPs 222 with different zinc finger divergence times. Within the whole genome, it is obvious 223 that KZFPs with younger zinc fingers tend to bind to TEs (fig. sought to clarify the detailed functions of KZFPs which bind to non-TE 226 regions. Based on KZFP ChIP-seq or ChIP-exo data, all of the PCGs were classified 227 into three categories: noKZFP_PCGs, KZFP-TE_PCGs and KZFP-nonTE_PCGs (fig. 228 3C). We found that the biological functions of these three types of PCGs were obvious 229 different. Interestingly, the development related processes were specifically 230 over-represented in KZFP-nonTE_PCGs (fig. 4D), and KZFP-TE_PCGs were with 231 higher tolerance to functional variations than KZFP-nonTE_PCGs (fig. 3E). Moreover, 232 KZFP-TE_PCGs and KZFP-nonTE_PCGs are under higher purifying selection 233 pressure than noKZFP_PCGs (fig. 4F). These results revealed that 234 KZFP-nonTE_PCGs are of greatest functional essentiality among the three types of 235 PCGs, indicating the functions regulated by KZFPs via binding to non-TE regions are 236 very important. 237 KZFP genes encoding young zinc fingers tend to have higher expression level in 238 early embryonic development and the ESC differentiation into mesoderm 239 The preceding analyses are not related to the expression of KZFPs in ., 2019). To verify whether the divergence time of the KZFP genes is correlated to 244 their expression level, we explored the relationship between the evolutionary 245 divergence time (full protein divergence time, KRAB domain divergence time and 246 zinc finger divergence time) and gene expression level. Full protein divergence time is 247 positively correlated with gene expression level for both TFs and other PCGs in 248 almost all samples, and for C2H2-ZFPs in part of samples. However, this correlation 249 for KZFPs was not significant in all samples. Interestingly, there was a negative 250 correlation between zinc finger divergence time and expression level of KZFPs in 251 early embryonic development and early mesoderm differentiation (fig. 4A; 252 supplementary table 5), such as ZNF90, ZNF611 and ZNF814 (fig. 4B). In other 253 words, in these samples, KZFPs with young zinc fingers have higher gene expression 254 level, suggesting that younger-zinc-finger-containing KZFPs may play important roles 255 in early embryonic development and early mesoderm differentiation. 256 KZFPs can positively regulate target genes by binding to non-TE regions in 257 endoderm or mesoderm differentiation 258 The data of chromatin accessibility, such as ATAC-seq data, can improve the 259 predictability of in vivo transcription factor (TF) binding sites (Keilwagen, Posch, & 260 Grau, 2019; H. Li, Quang, & Guan, 2019). Since transcription activators 261 predominantly bound in accessible chromatin (Thurman et al., 2012), ATAC-seq data 262 was mainly used for the prediction of TF binding sites mediating positive regulation. 263 Interestingly, the peaks of KZFP ChIP-seq overlapping with non-TE regions were 264 more likely to exist in open chromatin region in ESC than those overlapping with target genes positively regulated by KZFPs in endoderm or mesoderm 269 differentiation (fig. 5B). In total, we screened 4,116 target genes positively regulated 270 by 112 KZFPs during ESCs differentiation to endoderm, and 2,490 target genes 271 positively regulated by 76 KZFPs during ESCs differentiation to mesoderm. Of the 272 two target gene sets mentioned above, 86.1 % and 83.8 % are KZFP-nonTE PCGs 273 respectively. To verify the reliability of this prediction, ZNF202, ZNF383 and 274 ZNF589 from endoderm differentiation and ZFP14, ZNF554 and ZNF565 from 275 mesoderm differentiation were randomly chosen for the experimental validation. 276 Interestingly, they positively regulated their target genes in ESCs but not in HEK293T 277 cells (supplementary fig. 7A-7E; supplementary results). This could be further 278 confirmed by the status of chromatin accessibility of the target genes in these two cell 279 lines (supplementary fig. 7F; supplementary results). Further analysis of binding sites 280 of 262 KZFPs in ESCs and HEK293T cells, we also found that many regions bound 281 by KZFPs are in accessible chromatin in ESCs, while in HEK293T cells they are in 282 inaccessible chromatin (supplementary fig. 8). These results indicated that KZFPs can 283 play positive regulatory roles in particular biological states. 284 According to the traditional understanding of KZFP functions, most of KZFPs 285 silenced TEs and also repressed the neighboring gene expression at TEs (Jacobs et al., 286 2014; Oleksiewicz et al., 2017; P. Yang et al., 2017). Previously, some studies also 287 found that part of KZFPs can positively regulate target genes. For example, Schmitges 288 et al. found 31 KZFPs can interact with at least one activator and it was further 289 confirmed that ZNF554 can positively regulate the expression of target Schmitges et al., 2016). Chen et al. found that ZFP30 positively regulated the target 291 genes by binding to TE-derived enhancers (Chen et al., 2019). However, it is still 292 unclear whether KZFPs may play positive regulatory roles by binding to non-TE 293 regions. Here, we firstly report that there are a large number of target genes positively 294 regulated by KZFPs via binding to non-TE regions in certain spatiotemporal states. 295 These new findings expand our understanding of the functional characteristics of the detailed functions of target genes positively regulated by 298 KZFPs, we analyzed the regulatory functions of KZFP-TE_PCGs and 299 KZFP-nonTE_PCGs in these two differentiation processes. Interestingly, we found 300 KZFP-nonTE_PCGs specifically tend to participate in the functions closely related to 301 the development of corresponding embryo layer in both endoderm differentiation and 302 mesoderm differentiation, such as pharyngeal system development (supplementary fig. 303 9A) and heart development (fig. 5C). These results indicate that KZFPs play 304 important roles in the differentiation of ESCs to endoderm or mesoderm via 305 regulating target genes by binding to non-TE regions. 306 From the perspective of functional essentiality, KZFP-TE_PCGs have higher 307 tolerance than KZFP-nonTE_PCGs in both differentiation of endoderm 308 (supplementary fig. 9B) and mesoderm (fig. 5D). Moreover, KZFP-TE_PCGs are 309 under lower purifying selection pressure than KZFP-nonTE_PCGs in endoderm 310 differentiation (supplementary fig. 9C), while there is no significant difference in 311 mesoderm differentiation (fig. 5E). These results further confirmed that 312 KZFP-nonTE_PCGs are under stronger functional constraint and selection pressure, 313 consistently indicating that binding to the non-TE regions in promoters is an 314 important regulatory mechanism for KZFPs and the target genes that regulated in the preceding section, some KZFPs containing young zinc 319 fingers highly expressed in early mesoderm differentiation (fig. 4). To validate the 320 functional roles of these young-zinc-finger-containing KZFPs in mesoderm 321 differentiation, the key KZFPs that may play important roles were selected and the 322 validation experiments were conducted. Combined zinc finger divergence time, gene 323 expression in mesoderm differentiation and the known functional annotations of 324 KZFP target genes, ZNF611 and its target genes bone morphogenetic protein receptor, 325 type II (BMPR2) and serine/threonine kinase 38 (STK38) were selected to do the 326 validation experiments. BMPR2 is a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase that binds 327 BMP2 and BMP7 in association with multiple type I receptors, including 328 BMPR-IA/Brk1, BMPR-IB, and ActR-I (Liu, Ventura, Doody, & Massague, 1995). 329 STK38 is a member of the protein kinase A (PKA)/PKG/PKC-like family, and STK38 330 can negative regulate of MEKK1/2 signaling (Enomoto et al., 2008). Both BMPR2 331 and STK38 are important in mesoderm differentiation, so we assumed that ZNF611 is 332 involved in mesoderm differentiation by positively regulating BMPR2 and STK38. To 333 test the hypothesis, we first examined the effect of ZNF611's expression level on the 334 mRNA level of BMPR2 and STK38 using quantitative PCR. The overexpression of 335 ZNF611 in the ESC cells increased the mRNA level of STK38 (fig. 6A). Similarly, 336 when ZNF611 was knockdown with two different siRNA sequences, the mRNA level 337 of STK38 was decreased as well (fig. 6B). 338 Furthermore, we want to predict and verify the binding site of ZNF611 in the 339 promoter of STK38 gene. According to ChIP-seq data, ZNF611 can bind to non-of STK38 in ChIPs by using flag antibodies (fig. 6D). These observations 344 indicated that ZNF611 indeed binds to non-TE region in 5' UTR of STK38 and 345 positively regulates STK38 in ESCs, suggesting that ZNF611 can regulate the 346 differentiation of ESC into mesoderm by positively regulating STK38. 347 We next explored whether the binding sequence in STK38 promoter drives the 348 evolution of key amino acids in zinc fingers of ZNF611. To this end, we collected the 349 key amino acids in the zinc fingers of ZNF611 and other KZFPs in the cluster 350 produced by Imbeault et al. (Imbeault et al., 2017). Then the sequences of key amino 351 acids were aligned and the phylogeny tree was generated (fig. 6E). We can see that the 352 key amino acids of ZNF611 are similar with other homologous KZFPs within 353 Catarrhini instead of other Simiiformes, consistent with the zinc finger divergence 354 time determined by Imbeault et al. (Imbeault et al., 2017). We predicted the ZNF611 355 binding motif by RACDE (Najafabadi, Albu, & Hughes, 2015) and found that there 356 was a binding sequence of ZNF611 in 5' UTR of STK38 (fig. 6F). Based on the 357 alignment of the STK38 promoter locus from 21 representative species, we found the 358 ZNF611 binding site in STK38 are highly conserved in Simiiformes (fig. 6G). To 359 further verify the accuracy of the ZNF611 binding site, we cloned a~1.2-kb DNA 360 fragment upstream of the STK38 transcription start site (TSS) into a pGL3-basic 361 luciferase vector (termed pGL3-STK38-P), containing the described ZNF611 binding 362 motif. We also generated deletion lacking the ZNF611 binding motif 363 (pGL3-STK38-\u0394P) (fig. 6H). The ZNF611 overexpression dose-dependently 364 increased the luciferase activity of pGL3-STK38-P, but not the pGL3-STK38-years later) the zinc fingers of ZNF611 evolved to adapt to the emergence 369 of the new sequence. Therefore, there was a change in key amino acids in zinc fingers 370 of ZNF611 in the common ancestor of catarrhini. 371 Discussion 372 In this study, we tried to comprehensively characterize the evolutionary features 373 of KZFPs by the analysis of the divergence time and diversification pattern of KRAB 374 domains, zinc fingers and the full protein of KZFPs. We then explored the functional 375 features of the target genes of KZFPs with different ages, so as to answer the question 376 why KZFP family evolved so fast. We found that: (1) the rapid evolution of KZFPs in 377 mammalian is mainly reflected in the rapid evolution of zinc fingers of them. (2) 378 KZFPs with old zinc fingers contain variable and disordered KRAB domains. (3) 379 Different with the previous conclusions (Helleboid et al., 2019; Imbeault et al., 2017), 380 KZFPs tend to bind to non-TE regions, instead of TEs, particularly in exons, and 381 promoters. (4) Different from the classical repression function of KZFPs, we found 382 that, in certain processes, such as ESC differentiation, lots of KZFPs can positively 383 regulate target genes via binding to non-TE regions. (5) Some young 384 zinc-finger-containing KZFPs (e.g. ZNF611) are highly expressed in early embryonic 385 development and early mesoderm differentiation. After experimental verification, we 386 found ZNF611, which contains young zinc fingers, binds to non-TE region in 5' UTR 387 of STK38 and positively regulates its expression in ESCs, and importantly, the 388 emergence of new sequence in STK38 promoter may drive the evolution of zinc 389 fingers in ZNF611. These results indicate that the KZFPs containing young non-TE regions may be one of the drivers for rapid evolution of zinc 393 fingers in KZFPs. Moreover, STK38 was up-regulated in differentiation of human 394 ESCs into mesoderm, while Stk38 was down-regulated in differentiation of mouse 395 ESCs into mesoderm (supplementary fig. 10), suggesting that there is a new 396 regulation (that is, positively regulated by ZNF611) of STK38 in differentiation of 397 human ESCs into mesoderm. Overall, these findings show that binding to non-TE 398 regions is one of the important ways for KZFPs to greatly contribute to the formation 399 and evolution of gene regulatory networks. 400 Based on our results, combining with the conclusions of existing researches 401 (Ecco et al., 2017; Helleboid et al., 2019), we proposed a new KZFP family evolution 402 model: 'two-way evolution model' (fig. 7). The evolution of the KZFP family mainly 403 includes two directions. One is the divergence of key amino acids in zinc fingers (that 404 is, KZFPs containing young zinc fingers), adapting to the changes of the target sites 405 (such as TEs reported in previous studies, or non-TE regions revealed by this study). 406 Almost all of the KRAB domains in these KZFPs are completely structured and the 407 whole protein of these KZFPs also are relatively highly structured, suggesting that 408 they have a single and unchangeable function execution pattern and constantly 409 interact with a specific co-factor (such as KAP-1). In another evolutionary path, the 410 key amino acids in the zinc fingers are conserved (that is, KZFPs containing old zinc 411 fingers), and their target sites are also conserved. However, the KRAB domains of 412 these KZFPs are variable and tend to be disordered, suggesting that their KRAB 413 domains are versatile, interacting with multiple proteins. Therefore, Zerbino et al., 2018), and the HMM file of KRAB domain and zf-C2H2 domain were 420 download from Pfam v29.0 (Finn et al., 2010). The KZFPs and C2H2-ZFPs were 421 filtered using HMMER v3.1b2 (Eddy, 2009). The validation of transcription factors 422 was based on DBD (DNA-binding domain) transcription factor database 423 (Kummerfeld & Teichmann, 2006) and Ref. (Ravasi et al., 2010). 424 The definition of the divergence time of the full protein sequence, KRAB domain 425 and zinc finger of KZFPs 426 The divergence time of the full protein sequence was inferred according to the 427 homology information from Ensembl Compara (Herrero et al., 2016; Vilella et al., 428 2009). To identify the divergence time of KRAB domain in human KZFPs, protein 429 sequences of 80 species from 80 genera in deuterostomia were downloaded from 430 Ensembl database (supplementary table 6). KRAB domains in 80 species were 431 identified by HMMER v3.1b2 (Eddy, 2009). BLSATP was used to calculate the 432 homology between human KRAB domains and KRAB domains in other 79 species. 433 The hits with the identity and the percentage of the matched sequence in query or 434 subject sequence above 80% were selected as homologous KRAB domains. The 435 KRAB domain divergence time of each human KZFP was determined based on the 436 species with farthest evolutionary distance from human in all species containing the 437 homologous KRAB domains. The divergence times of KZFP zinc finger were inferred 438 according to the similarity between the key amino acids in zinc-fingers (Imbeault et 439 al., 2017).

            "text": "characteristics of KZFP family and the reasons for the rapid evolution of this family. By identifying the evolutionary features of the KRAB domains, zinc fingers and the 93 full protein of KZFPs, and analyzing the functions of target genes besides TEs, this 94 study provides new understandings about the rapid evolution of KZFP family. Comparison of the divergence time of the full sequence, KRAB domain and zinc In order to fully describe the evolutionary characteristics of KZFP family, the 99 evolutionary divergence time of each member of the human KZFP family was 100 calculated. For each KZFP, the full protein sequence, KRAB domain and the key 101 amino acids of zinc fingers were searched for its orthologs across species and the 102 divergence time was determined according to the last common ancestor of the species 103 containing its orthologs (see Method section for detail). Then the distribution pattern 104 of these three types of divergence time was explored. Firstly, by directly comparing 105 the divergence time distribution of the three type of divergence times, we found that, 106 in general, the divergence times of zinc fingers are significantly later than the other 107 two types of divergence times (fig. 1A, supplementary fig. 2A). Subsequently, we 108 compared the difference value of divergence time between any two types of 109 divergence times of each KZFP. KRAB divergence time is much earlier than the 110 divergence time of full protein sequence in 40.7% of KZFPs, and is later in 31.6% of KZFPs (fig. 1B). Zinc finger divergence time is later than the divergence time of full 112 protein sequence in 49.0% of KZFPs and is later than KRAB domain divergence time 113 in 59.1% of KZFPs. On contrast, the divergence time of zinc finger is earlier than the 114 divergence time of full protein sequence only in 4.8% of KZFPs and is earlier than 115 KRAB domain divergence time only in 10.2% of KZFPs. These results showed that about half of KZFPs are much younger when they are evaluated by the divergence 117 time of zinc fingers than by that of the full protein sequences or KRAB domains. The 118 more newly emerged zinc fingers reveal that the rapid evolution of KZFPs in 119 mammalian is mainly reflected in the rapid evolution of zinc fingers of them. Interestingly, the three types of divergence time are all the most at the grade of Eutheria (105 million years ago, Mya). There are 133, 188, 155 KZFPs belonging to 122 this grade of divergence time of the full protein sequence, KRAB domain and zinc 123 finger respectively (supplementary fig. 2A&2B). Their intersection and union are 72 124 and 258 respectively. This result indicates that there are a large number of KZFPs 125 originating in the common ancestor of eutherians. This may be related to the special 126 traits in this clade. Compared with the other mammalians, such as marsupials and 127 monotremes, eutherians have relatively long gestation periods during embryonic 128 development (Behringer, Eakin, & Renfree, 2006), in which the KZFPs with the age 129 of 'Eutheria' may play important roles (Nowick, Carneiro, & Faria, 2013). The diversification pattern of KRAB domains and zinc fingers in human The rapid and frequent divergence of the sequence of KZFPs led to the 132 diversification of KZFP members in the current existing species. To characterize the 133 outcome of the evolution of KZFP family in human genome, the diversification 134 patterns of the KRAB domains and the key amino acids of zinc fingers were analyzed.Through multiple sequence alignment of all human KRAB-A box sequences, we 136 found that a cluster of 35 KZFPs have variant KRAB domains compared with other KZFPs (fig. 2A). We then supposed that the KRAB domains of these 35 KZFPs may 138 also have special structural characteristics. The structural disorder ratio of the KRAB 139 domains was compared between these 35 KZFPs and others. As the result, these 35 2B). Disordered protein domains tend to have diverse structural conformations, 142 and then have diverse interacting partners and functions (Csizmok, Follis, Kriwacki, 143 & Forman-Kay, 2016; Mosca, Pache, & Aloy, 2012). Thus, we inferred that the 144 KRAB domains in this special cluster may have diverse interacting partners besides KAP-1, the universal and canonical partner of KRAB domain. This result is consistent KRAB domains, these 35 KRAB domains tend to be old (Amniota -Mammalia) or",
