(1; 2; 3) As COVID-19 expands to new territories, after a latent phase with few new reported infections daily, the virus spreads rapidly and local outbreaks begin. The virus's containment is complicated by its high transmissibility, relatively low case fatality rate, and lengthy asymptomatic infectious period. (4) Currently, the most successful measure to prevent the rapid expansion of COVID-19 has been to restrain travels and physical interactions between individuals, a policy referred to as social distancing. (5; 6) Extreme social distancing has devastating consequences for the global economy. Quarantine policies may be an effective short-term measure, but indefinite quarantine until a vaccine becomes available would prevent billions of individuals worldwide from receiving an income, and could particularly devastate countries with weaker economies. This economic harm could increase mortality given the correlation between mortality and income, (7) especially for children. (8) Computational models that simulate the expansion of the disease can guide public policy makers in mitigating the detrimental outcomes of the outbreak (9) . Existing epidemiological models estimate the number of unknown infected individuals, forecast the number of patients requiring intensive care treatment, predict the death toll, and evaluate the outcomes of different policies. In compartmental modeling, different disease stages are modeled as compartments, and transitions between compartments are modeled by a system of differential equations. (10) Compartmental models provide useful insight into the mechanisms governing the spread of the disease and help evaluate public policies. (11; 12; 13) Some papers focus on how quarantine restrictions affect disease spread. (6; 13; 14; 15; 16) Time series approaches use available data to statistically forecast the evolution of the disease. (17; 18; 19) While times series models have precise results, they do not illuminate the dynamics of the disease spread.",

Our model includes, among other compartments, a large group of asymptomatic infected individuals and compartments that represent quarantined individuals. We separate the population into four groups in our simulations, according to age and the economic impact of remaining in quarantine for an extended period of time. Upon infection, senior individuals present much larger co-morbidity and mortality rates than younger individuals. Also, generalized country-wide lockdowns completely suppress the productivity of some workers while having minimal implications for others. By modeling our population as having different risk groups, economic risks from quarantine, and productivity levels, we can make more specific predictions, and are able to provide more targeted policy recommendations than existing methods.",

However, if the quarantine policy for the senior population is not strictly enforced, there can be disastrous consequences. No quarantine restriction approach resolves the pandemic, and lockdown policies can only be used as a bridge to a global vaccination program. 3) Strict isolation policies and a strong reduction of contagiousness from the asymptomatic infected individuals can reduce the total number of hospitalizations and the number of deaths as compared to loosely enforced measures. Therefore, stark measures must be enforced to prevent a prolonged pandemic.",

Our model provides a framework for making such decisions that takes into account differences within the population and disease changes that may occur over time. We provide evidence about what quarantine policies may allow for minimal deaths while maximizing economic productivity. We find that once infection levels are somewhat controlled, very gradual relaxation of the restrictions on younger groups can minimize health consequences and economic damage. the manuscript.
