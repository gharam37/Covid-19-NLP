[13] (in Portuguese, please see instructions to retrieve the data), with a historical occupancy of not less than 85%, which yields in about 5500 free ICUs [14] . The global European number of ICUs per 100.000 inhabitants is around 10 [15] , US leading the world with a ratio of 34.7 [16] , much below what is expected to be needed as the number of infections approaches its peak. Therefore, no country is really prepared for a devastating amount of critical patients. To * askery.canabarro@arapiraca.ufal.br cope with that and in order to protect the healthcare systems, in the absence of any efficient medicament and/or vaccine to pharmaceutically detain the fast spread of the disease, many public policies and governmental strategies, termed as non-phamaceutical interventions (NPIs), are been tested amid the epidemic/pandemic situation. Currently, many of such public health measures have been discussed/proposed to decrease the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, by reducing the social contact in the population and, consequently, the transmission rate of the virus, alleviating the health system and providing time for auxiliary measures (expansion of the system, military hospitals and so on).",

Here, we present a data-driven and census-based age-structured mathematical epidemiological model capable of asserting the potential output of many NPI over the Brazillian health system by explicitly computing the basic reproduction rate R 0 , the evolution of the number of infections and the required quantity of ICUs needed over time. The model is a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for each layer of the age stratification reported for the COVID-19 within the Brazilian population. It is a variation of the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered/Death (SIRD) model stratified by age group in which people flow among four states: susceptible (S), infected (I), recovered (R) and dead (D), assuming that the recovered population do not become susceptible, as is suggested for COVID-19. By modeling the current Brazilian scenario, we investigate the effects of applying one of the following NPI policies (or a combination of those): 0) a complete absence of control measures (No NPI); 1) closure of schools and universities (CSU); 2) Social distancing of those over sixty years old (SD60+);",

However, we deal with a epidemiological model, not capable of inferring the by-product of the NPIs over the overall well-being of the population. Therefore, it is virtually impossible for governments simultaneously to minimize the socialeconomical impact of COVID-19 pandemic and protect the health system, which means minimising deaths. The case of China indicates that in practice some NPIs (quaratine, social distancing, isolation of infected individuals) can contain the virus spread [6] , but as soon as the measures are relaxed another outbreak can take place [23] possibly triggered by imported cases, meaning that, probably, NPIs are necessary from time to time. As we will see, our model predicts that for the Brazilian scenario, only intense quarantine (essentially a combination of NPIs) can prevent the collapse of the health system and consequently save a larger number of lives.",

In a nutshell, and as schematically shown in Fig. 1 , susceptible (S) individuals can become infected mainly by direct interaction with infected (I) persons at a rate \u03b2, who can recover (R) at a rate \u03b1 and become resistant to the virus or die (D) at a rate \u03b3. If, on average, one infected person contaminates one or more individuals, the epidemic is sustainable, otherwise it dies out. This is the definition of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), which represents the average number of secondary cases from a single infectious case in a totally susceptible population (in the very beginning of the infection the susceptible population corresponds approximately to the total population N , S \u2248 N ), defined as R 0 = \u03b2/(\u03b1 + \u03b3). Therefore, it is very important to reduce the transmission rate in order to reduce the subsequent reproduction ratio R n (not to mistaken with the number of recovered individuals) so that R n < 1 and the epidemic fades out. In the unlikely worst case scenario in which the government does not impose any measures for containing the infectious disease, R will decrease below unit due to exhaustion of susceptible individuals, at the expense of a tremendous amount of infected and dead individuals, collapsing not only the health system but the economy as well.",

In the absence of such data for the Brazilian case, we used some data reported in studies with the largest number of individuals with an age-distributed fatality rate (\u03b3 i ) [1] and the percentage of persons undergoing critical intense care (c i ) [2] . For the recovery rate (\u03b1 i ) we use the assumption that \u03b1 i = (1 \u2212 \u03b3 i ) * r, where r is the overall fraction of recovery in the closed cases, known so far to be r = 0.82, meaning that 82% of those who did not succumb to the disease are now healed [7] . This does not imply a overall death ratio of 18%, since it accounts only for closed cases, in which one can compute statistics. Although this fraction could change over time, the statistics is reliable since the number of total closed cases is N closed = 191, 623, roughly 25% of the confirmed cases at the time of writing. The parameter \u03b2 i describes the efficacy of the infection process and can be measure indirectly. Our first assumption is that this efficacy depends weakly on the age group, therefore \u03b2 i = \u03b2 is a constant vector. The effective value of \u03b2 can be computed as R 0 = \u03b2 \u03b1i+\u03b3 i , where x stands for the mean value of the variable x and R 0 reproduction number already defined and calculated to be in the range 1.5 \u2212 6.0 in many countries [9, 11] .

It means that one infected person, on average, is contaminating 3 other individuals. A clear indication that Brazil should not relax the NPIs adopted so far. In fact, as we will show in the next section, even stronger measures are going to be needed to avoid surpassing the capacity of the national health system and, consequently, minimize the number of severe cases and deaths. As we seek to estimate the demand for ICUs and it depends heavily on the number of infected (see Eq. 6), we are going to use to value of R 0 which best fits the variable I, so R 0 = 2.9 (even though the fit for D seems visually more accurate). It implies \u03b2 = R 0 * (\u03b1 i + \u03b3 i ) = 2.39.",

Given that the actual NPI scenario in Brazil is represented by the combination of the lowest values of the g i functions in Table II SD60+ and VHQ, the only possible measure is an intense quarantine (last column of Table II ). Except a intense quarantine, all the other scenarios are more catastrophic, meaning a faster collapse of the system.

As discussed, the only scenario which considerably reduces the number of infected persons and deaths is an intense quarantine. It reduces to 34.5 thousand infections and 1300 deaths. In particular, we notice that changing the current NPI to SD60+ (social distancing of people above 60 years old), as been currently discussed by parts of the Brazilian federal government, is completely catastrophic.

An important observation is that our predictions are likely to be a lower bound to the actual numbers, since the confirmed cases are potentially underestimated given the lack of widespread clinical testing in Brazil. With more accurate data, it is possible that the fitting in Fig 2 would produce an even higher value for R 0 . In addition, our model can be applied to other countries or regions with minimal adaptation, since it will require only updates in Tables I -III . Finally, although we have employed many data-driven assumptions, the results presented here may still underestimate the threat to the national health system due to the particular social problems in Brazil, such as: (i) high level of cardiopathologies, a reported relevant comorbidity; (ii) considerable number of people without proper water and wasting supplies; (iii) large number of people living in the same house in peripheral zones due to housing deficit, (iv) high density of obesity cases and some other immune suppressant diseases, just to cite a few. On the positive side, there can be a potential defense against SARS-Cov-2 for those BCG-vaccinated [30] , which belongs to the universal vaccination program in Brazil [31] . Furthermore, the public health system in Brazil has great capillarity, in principle being capable of identify potential cases in the very beginning of the symptoms.
