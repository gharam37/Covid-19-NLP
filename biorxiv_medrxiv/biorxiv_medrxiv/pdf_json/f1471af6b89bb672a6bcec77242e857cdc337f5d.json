The peak is a positive sign which marks the end of the exponential phase of infection spread and a transition into a phase that is a manageable. Most countries or provinces with similar but independent growth trajectories had taken drastic measures for containing the COVID-19 pandemic and are eagerly waiting to cross the peak. However, the data after many weeks of strict measures suggests that most provinces instead enter a phase where the infections are in a linear growth. While the transition out of an exponential phase is relieving, the roughly constant number of daily new infections differ widely, range from around 50 in Singapore to around 2000 just in Lombardy (Italy), and 7600 in Spain. The daily new infection rate of a region seems to depend heavily on the time point in the exponential evolution when the restrictive measures were adopted, rather than on the population of the region. It is not easy to point the critical source of these persistent infections. We attempt to interpret this data using a simple model of newer infections mediated by asymptomatic patients, which underscores the importance of actively identifying any potential leakages in the quarantine. Given the novelty of the virus, it is hard to predict too far into the future and one needs to be observant to see if a plan B is needed as a second round of interventions. So far, the peak achieved by most countries with the first round of intervention is extremely flat.",

Governments and public health modelers are interested in understanding the effectiveness of various strategies [7] [8] [9] [10] starting from a complete lockdown, or a reduced social contact [11] and a subsequent release of restrictions in a phased manner. Many such models have already been developed to model COVID-19, and have been guided by the past intuitions from modeling how the epidemic spread declines with changes in season or with active containment strategies, and the success of China which after 2 months of lockdown reports no new COVID-19 infection cases consistently for more than 3 weeks.",

Crossing the peak signifies that one may expect fewer cases of infection, compared to the previous day. It sends positive signals of pandemic containment to the people as well as to the economy and other aspects of the social life. It also indicates the time for lowering the guard is not too far. As such, a few weeks after these strict measures, and noting the reported success of China, governments of various provinces and countries are waiting for the new daily infections to cross over the peak. Because of the drastic measures, the number of daily new cases are no longer increasing in many places. However, it is worrying that they do not have clear signatures of a downward trend either. In this context, we perform a detailed analysis of the nature of this peak, and whether it has been achieved. As it turns out, most provinces and countries that implemented containment are no longer in an exponential growth phase, but rather enter a new, and possibly unexpected, linear growth phase which we discuss here.",

One can see from the data in the growth phase of the pandemic spread in any country that typically R < 10-15% of I, and I << P. In principle, one can also consider detailed models such as the SIR model, or even detailed agent-based models assuming a more realistic social contact structure.

However, the transmission across countries or less-frequented provinces, occurs much through a jump-diffusion process, with only occasional jumps over these boundaries, and a diffusion within the region. As a consequence, the trajectory of a country with two epicenters can be thought as two independent weakly interacting subsystems which leads to emergence of a multi-exponential I(t)= I0,1 exp(a1t)+ I0,2 exp(a2t) with the I0,1 and I0,2 being the number of infections in these two decoupled regions at t=0, and a1, a2 the rates in these two regions which may or may not be same depending on mobility in the cities, any other restrictions imposed by the local Governors. For administrative reasons, one may be interested in following the trajectory of the world, or of a specific country. But depending upon the lag between these multiple hotspots, the exponential nature of the growth gets masked. Thus, for detailed studies, one needs to unmask this data by decoupling these multiple exponentials and focusing on the individual provinces, which are possibly separated from other provinces by travel restrictions. After decoupling, it is clear that the different regions very similar exponential growth curves.",

In Figure 2 , we study the growth in South Korea, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Spain, [14] Germany and two of its states (Bayern, Baden) and another Italian province Venice. It is apparent from the data that the later part of the data from all these countries shows a clearly linear trend. Even the number of deaths recorded on a daily basis also show the same linear trend. Clearly a transition from the exponential regime is a relief. And this transition happens around 10 days from the day of the restrictive measure, possibly coinciding with the distribution of the incubation time.",

In the initial months of COVID-19 infection, people over an age of 65, and with comorbidities were considered highly susceptible.

The second linear regime from South Korea thus presents an interesting case study. South Korea had ramped up its testing capacity from about 1000 per day in early February to around 10,000 per day from February 25 till at least early April. Whether the reduced number of daily infections a few weeks after this ramp up is a consequence of the tests or of any contact tracing that allowed them to test and isolate the large number of asymptomatic individuals or purely depends on the decay time of the infection in the asymptomatic individuals which was has so far been underestimated to be around 10 days needs to be understood with an in-depth analysis of the policies and implementation, which we could not perform even after parsing through the information that is publicly available.",

If there are indeed such leakages, these are not the ones that can be predicted by following the overall number of infections of states or countries as was done in this work, but rather by taking a detailed audit, by tracking the need and rigor of implementation in each industry and segment of the society. We analyze the data using a simple model that seems to suggest that if the linearity persists, this may be due to leakages in the quarantine system, and can be partly compensated by increasing the rate of testing. Theoretically, it is possible that the measures adopted by China were much more stringent compared to other countries which allowed a reduction in the new infections.

With all good intentions, we wish the slope of this linearity to be reduced in a few weeks, and the linearity shown in this work is not relevant in longer term. However, the data is not currently in favor of such wishes. Thus, to understand if the existing interventions are working one needs to detach oneself from the notion of a peak followed by a decline or even the linear Table 1 .

The slope from the linear regime was compared with several factors to see if any factor could potentially help interpret the linear regime. It is understood that all these factors are not entirely independent but some are connected. The cumulative infections and the number of daily cases around the time when the transition occurred are the most correlated. The number of tests performed per single detection is poorly correlated, and the other variables such as population of the region do not appear correlated. As much as the linear regime suggests the end of the exponential growth phase, a correlation of the daily cases with the average number of infections at the time of transition seems to suggest that the growth is only maintained in a \"pause\", frozen at the state where the quarantines are implemented. 3) were simulated to see if the observations can be captured. The simulation was performed with parameters such as a=0.1, and the transmission via asymptomatic is individuals is much lesser with l=0.01. At this growth stage of the pandemic since the data from most countries show a recovery rate of around 10%, we performed the simulation with \u00b5=0. The asymptomatic (blue), and recorded infections (red) with two different testing rates r=0.2 and 1.2 initiated after the lockdown period (30 on axis which represents the days) are shown in panels A and B. As expected a transition from an exponential to linearity is observed. Panel C shows the daily new infections when r=1.2. Since the Eq.(3) is stochastic, we added an incubation period drawn randomly from a beta-distribution with a mean of 10 days. For this choice of parameters which were chosen to qualitatively emulate the peak observed in South Korea, a a low level of daily new infections persist. However, by varying r, it was seen that these average number of these daily new cases decreases with the r and increases with the time of lockdown (data not shown).",
