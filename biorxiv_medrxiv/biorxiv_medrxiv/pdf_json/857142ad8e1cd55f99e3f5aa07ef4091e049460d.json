We participated in an unprecedentedly open and urgent 27 iterative process to help develop and validate new swabs. 28 Methods 29 We tested prototypes for material suitability, collection sufficiency, PCR compatibility, and the 30 likelihood that they could be mass-produced, individually packaged, and sterilized quickly. 31 Suitable prototypes were selected for an ongoing IRB-approved clinical trial. Participants were 32 outpatients suspected of COVID-19 who presented to our drive-through test station. Each 33 participant was swabbed with a control swab followed by a prototype swab. For each prototype, 34 at least 10 control-swab positive and 10 control-swab negative PCR results were collected. We 35 measured concordance using Cohen's kappa, compared Ct values by Mann-Whitney U, and 36 assessed staff preferences via written survey. 37 Results 38 We evaluated 45 materials and 150 designs from 23 individuals, laboratories, and companies. 39 We have selected four so far for the clinical trial.

Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs provide the highest sensitivity for detecting SARS-CoV-56 2 infection during early infection using commercial reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain 57 reaction (RT-PCR)-based assays. An NP swab is an FDA Class I exempt medical device 58 roughly 15 cm in length and 2-3mm in diameter designed to reach the posterior nasopharynx 59 (Fig. 1a, b) . It generally consists of a shaft, a neck, and a head coated with flock (short synthetic 60 filaments). The swab is inserted into the nasopharynx, rotated to collect material, and placed 61 into a vial containing viral transport media (VTM). A breakpoint on the shaft enables detachment 62 and release of the head into the vial, which is then sealed and sent for testing. 63 The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in severe shortages of diagnostic testing 64 supplies, including NP swabs, due to both manufacturing stoppages resulting in decreased 65 supply and pandemic spread resulting in unprecedented demand 2 . To address the swab 66 shortage, hospitals and other testing centers have repurposed other commercially available 67 swabs (e.g. throat, urogenital) to collect nasal epithelial mucosa for testing. However, these 68 swabs are suboptimal for swabbing the nasopharynx due to differences in size and flexibility 69 and the possibility they contain PCR-inhibitory materials 3, 4 . 70 In the short term, one solution is to design and 3D-print swabs. Advantages include simplicity 71 over the multistep process of applying flock, the widespread availability of 3D printing capacity, 72 and the ability to iterate prototypes rapidly 5 . To resolve the swab-shortage crisis, we have been 73 participating in an open collaborative process that has brought together many medical centers, 74 individuals, academic laboratories, and both new and well established manufacturers 6 . As part 75 of this process, we have been testing and continuously providing feedback on prototype swabs 76 in order to proceed rapidly but safely toward the development of swabs that can be used 77 clinically, at volumes sufficient to address the need. The openness of the process was a 78 conscious decision supported by a substantial body of scientific literature, including the previous 79 experience of the present authors, that demonstrates advantages relative to closed or more 80 siloed approaches 7-9 . At our institution, this process has led to an ongoing clinical trial of several 81 prototype swabs, the first results of which we report here.",

And fourth, we note the utility of our \"round-robin\" A-B testing survey to summarize preferences, 255 although the narrative comments seemed often to be more positive the round robin suggested; 256 a possible explanation is simply study staff's familiarity with the control swab. 257 Like the control swab, the prototype swabs we tested can be improved upon, and manufacturers 258 are currently doing so. The same is true for other prototypes we may test through our ongoing 259 trial. Especially in a crisis, perfect is the enemy of good enough. We hope our experience will 260 provide a useful case study for how to iterate and produce a clinically validated medical 261 manufacture under the pressure of an ongoing pandemic, work on which others will hopefully 262 improve as we continue to fight COVID-19 together.

A GitHub repository 6 was established in the first days of the development effort 163 to serve a public resource and knowledge base. We updated the repository continuously with 164 design information and test results. These updates included high-resolution images of 165 prototypes submitted to us for testing 6 , a public database of results of our Phase I testing, and 166 periodic updates and guidance based on our experiences. Open communication facilitated rapid 167 design iteration by providing anyone interested with a way to quickly understand the required 168 specifications and to learn from each other's experiences. 169 Phase I testing. To date we have evaluated 45 materials and 150 designs submitted to us for 170 testing by 4 individuals, 2 laboratories, and 17 companies, for a total of 23 manufacturers (Fig. 171 1). Seven (4.7%) have passed Phase I testing. Most failures were either for inappropriate 172 materials, including some that were sticky or brittle, or for inappropriate designs, including those 173 with sharp heads. Prototypes from 19 manufacturers went through at least two iterations, with a 174 maximum of 27 prototypes from one manufacturer. The rate-limiting steps were receipt of new 175 prototypes, with slow mail delivery during the pandemic being a major contributor, and PCR-176 compatibility testing, as testing patient samples took priority over testing prototypes. 177 Communication with and responsiveness by manufacturers to our feedback were considered 178 outstanding. 179 Phase II and III prototypes. Four prototypes passed Phase II testing, of which three have 180 completed our Phase III clinical trial: these are prototypes from the 3D-printing manufacturers 181 Carbon3D, EnvisionTec, and Origin (Prototypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively; Fig. 1a).

All three prototypes exhibited a high degree of concordance with the control swab, 198 with kappas of 0.88, 0.85, and 0.89 (Prototypes 1-3, respectively; Fig. 2a). For convenience we 199 use the terminology of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, with 200 the control swab result considered the provisional gold standard. Each prototype exhibited a 201 single false positive and 1-2 false negatives. However, since control swabs are known to be an 202 imperfect gold standard (<100% sensitivity) and because PCR positives are more likely to 203 reflect true infection than error, false positives were interpreted as identifying missed infections. 204In fact per IRB protocol, false positives were referred to clinical care teams as clinically205    actionable. Of note, discordant cases were always associated with high Ct values, reflecting low 206 viral burden(Fig. 2b).207    To better assess possible performance differences between control and prototype swabs, we 208 compared Ct values for control-prototype pairs for which at least one was positive (assigning the 209 maximum-possible Ct to negatives; see Methods). Specifically, we asked whether the Ct values210    for the prototype swabs were systematically different from those of the control swabs.211    Systematically higher values for prototype swabs would suggest that they may underperform 212 control swabs, notwithstanding the high kappa values. We found no evidence for 213 underperformance, with MWU p-values of 0.36, 0.26, and 0.42 for Prototypes 1-3, respectively 214(Fig. 2b). This result indicates that the prototypes are non-inferior to the control.215    As an additional assessment of non-inferiority, we compared the difference in Ct values 216 observed between control and prototype swabs to the differences between replicates of control 217 swabs. Independent of our clinical trial, there were 88 cases in which a patient, in the course of 218 clinical care, was swabbed twice within 24 hours (mean\u00b1stdev, 15\u00b17 hours), during the time 219 period of our study. In 11 of these cases, at least one of the two swabs was positive for SARS-220 CoV-2. There were two disagreements between replicate swab tests (kappa=0.90), similar to 221 what was observed in our study for each prototype (kappa=0.85-0.89). Also as in our study, the222    Ct values for the first swab and second swab were not significantly different (MWU p-value of 223 0.18). Finally, the differences between Ct values for the first and second control swabs were 224 comparable to the differences between control and prototype swabs (MWU p-values of 0.",

            "text": "in Europe, necessitating urgent stopgap solutions. Scientific literature on time-235 sensitive decentralized innovation suggests that open and collaborative processes outperform 236 closed or proprietary ones 7-9 . Here we report the success of such a process, going from the 237 identification of the NP swab crisis to multiple clinically validated prototypes capable of high-238 throughput manufacture in 22 days. Notably, that none of the prototypes tested were flocked, 239 yet their performance was indistinguishable from the flocked control. 240 The urgency of the situation, the configuration of the manufacturing ecosystem, and human 241 nature contributed to several observations and shortcomings worth mentioning. First, 3D 242 printing has important advantages in a crisis, including the ability to iterate designs and output 243 swabs rapidly; it remains to be seen whether complementary manufacturing techniques, each 244 with advantages and disadvantages relative to 3D printing, will prove competitive in a more 245 mature market. Second, in any cooperative process there is a temptation to \"defect,\" taking 246 without giving back; individuals and manufacturers may well exploit open knowledge for 247 competitive advantage 16 . This is a known price of openness that can disincentivize future 248 cooperation, absent social or structural mechanisms to enforce norms. Third, ideally the study 249 size would be larger, and there would be a better null model to which to compare our results, 250 than replicates separated by many hours. Possible sources of variance in our study include 251 differences in secretions or viral burden between nares and the possibility that the first (control) 252 swab left little material for the second (prototype) when placed in the same naris. Despite these 253 potential issues, our statistical tests supported analytical non-inferiority for all three prototypes.254",
