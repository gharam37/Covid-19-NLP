Viral genome sequencing has emerged as a powerful means to link seemingly unrelated cases, and large-scale sequencing surveillance can inform on critical epidemiological parameters. Here, we report analysis of 156 SARS-CoV2 sequences from individuals in the New York City metropolitan area during the initial stages of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. The majority of samples had no recent travel history or known exposure. Comparison to global viral sequences showed that the majority of sequences were most related to samples from Europe. Our data are consistent with numerous seed transmissions and a period of unrecognized community spreading. This work highlights the complementary role of genomic surveillance to traditional epidemiological indicators.",

Shotgun metagenomics rapidly identified the SARS-CoV2 as a betacoronavirus related to the etiological agent of the 2002 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV (Zhou et al. 2020 ) and of possible bat origin (Andersen et al. 2020 ). In the ensuing months, genomic epidemiology has been applied to track the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV2 using mutations in viral genomes to link otherwise unrelated infections (Grubaugh et al. 2019; Zhang and Holmes 2020) . Rapid development of targeted sequencing protocols (Quick et al. 2017; ARTIC Network) , open sharing of sequences through the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) repository (Shu and McCauley 2017) , and rapid analysis and visualization of viral phylogenies using Nextstrain (Hadfield et al. 2018 ) have provided unprecedented and timely insight into the spread of the pandemic. Most notably, surveillance sequencing in the Seattle area linked a communityacquired case to a travel-related case sampled 5 weeks prior, implying widespread undetected community transmission (Bedford et al. 2020) .",

By mid-April, New York State had >200,000 cases -nearly a third of known cases in the United States, and 10% of the worldwide total. The five boroughs of New York City lead in numbers of cases in NY State (>110,000 cases), followed by Nassau and Suffolk counties to the east on Long Island (>47,000 cases) (NYS DOH). The current epicenter overlaps with the catchment area of the NYU Langone Health hospital system, including hospitals on the east side of Manhattan, one in Brooklyn (NYU Lutheran), and one in Nassau County (NYU Winthrop). We therefore aimed to characterize the urban landscape of early COVID-19 transmission as well as to identify the provenance of the circulating strains.",

Samples were randomly selected from individuals testing positive between March 12 and April 1, 2020. Illumina RNA-seq libraries were generated from ribo-depleted total RNA. We experimented with several library construction approaches, ultimately selecting the robotic library construction approach used for later batches (Methods). Hybridization capture with custom biotinylated baits was then used to enrich RNA-seq libraries for viral cDNA for Illumina sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 1) . We extend our existing informatics processing and analysis pipeline for sequencing quality control (QC), mapping of reads to the reference, identification of variants, and generation of consensus sequences (Methods). Due to the infeasibility of repeating sub-optimal libraries from remnant samples, we used a two-tiered release criteria with minimum coverage cutoffs of 6x and 30x. Most samples yielded a successful sequence, although success rates were lower for viral loads below 1000 copies/\u00b5L ( Supplementary Fig. 2a-b) . We observed that high-quality sequences could be generated directly from shotgun libraries for viral loads above 10 5 copies/\u00b5L, thereby simplifying pooling and logistical constraints for capture. Up to 18 samples at a time were multiplexed in a given capture pool (Supplementary Fig. 2c-d) .",

Sampling density and incomplete availability of exposure history preclude fine-scale delineation of transmission directions and routes. In particular, few sequences from the key periods of January and February, thus limiting the direct observation of transmission events. While epidemiological metrics like Influenza-like illness surveillance and clinical parameters of COVID-19like pneumonias put a low upper limit on possible prevalence in that time frame, it is possible that screening and sequencing of archival samples may clarify the initial spread. Nevertheless, viral sequencing reflects the broad spread of SARS-CoV2 into the New York region, either directly or indirectly.",

However, given the rapid spread of SARS-CoV2, it is expected that most mutations identified thus far will not have detectable function, but rather are the result of genetic drift. Further sequencing will increase statistical power to search for signals of positive selection. Functional analysis will be required to determine whether function can be ascribed to any of these mutations, and what role mutations might play in shaping the pandemic. On a regional level, genomic epidemiology can provide an independent data source to track transmission. For example, sampling from the NY region demonstrates a much broader diversity of transmission chains than initially uncovered in Seattle (Bedford et al. 2020) . Retrospective analysis could illuminate the degree of undetected community spreading on a per-region basis, to assess the efficacy of policy and behavioral changes, and prospectively to inform proactive .

Nugen Trio with human rRNA depletion (Tecan Genomics, . Briefly the RNA library prep consists of the following steps: DNase treatment to remove any DNA, cDNA synthesis from the input RNA, single primer isothermal amplification (SPIA) of the resultant cDNAs, enzymatic fragmentation and construction of unique barcoded libraries followed by PCR library amplification (6 or 8 cycles were used, depending on input amount), and an AnyDeplete step to remove host rRNA transcripts. Later libraries were generated through an automated protocol on a Biomek FX P Liquid handler integrated with a Biometra TRobot 96-well thermal cycler (Beckman Coulter). We found that, especially for lower viral inputs, the Nugen Trio kit had a lower rate of duplicate reads. Based on these results, we selected this approach as the baseline.",
