In this approach, individual samples are processed in a single heat step, producing barcoded amplicons that can be shipped to a sequencing center, pooled, and analyzed en masse. Using unique barcode combinations per sample from a compressed barcode space enables extensive pooling, significantly reducing cost and organizational efforts. Given the low cost and scalability of next-generation sequencing, we believe that this method can be affordably scaled to analyze millions of samples per day using existing sequencing infrastructure.",

To exacerbate the problem, many infected individuals do not show symptoms, are unlikely to seek testing, and unknowingly contribute to the spread of infection. To effectively combat the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, we need population-scale testing that can enable rapid identification of all infected individuals, pinpoint key potential outbreak areas to support epidemiological interventions that maximize human health, while reducing the extent of restrictive isolation measures.",

This approach requires only a single heating step for each individual sample (i.e., nasal swab, oropharyngeal swab, nasal wash, fecal sample, or potentially sputum), followed by pooled processing, parallelizable deep sequencing, and standard computational analysis. By using a simple thermal protocol for individual samples and pooling many samples prior to resource-intensive steps, the requirement for specialized reagents, equipment, and labor is greatly reduced as compared to established RT-qPCR protocols. Unique tracking of tens of millions of samples as well as asynchronous testing logistics can be obtained by additionally employing a compressed barcode space. Below, we describe the design and initial validation of the method and simulated barcoding strategies.",

Templating two individually barcoded LAMP reactions with 100-fold differing amounts of dsDNA template, combining them for PCR amplification, and sequencing the products resulted in read numbers within two-fold between the two samples ( Fig. 1E ), indicating that LAMP saturation can effectively compress the dynamic range of input viral loads.",

To explore parameters for using a compressed barcoding space, we conservatively assume that 1% of synthesized barcode primers systematically fail to work (\u2206 synth = 0.01), while additionally 5% of all sample-specific barcodes are not detected due to varying sequencing depth (\u2206 stoch = 0.05; this is independent of dropout due to low viral load). For automated assembly of testing reactions with unique barcode combinations, we anticipate that up to m = 10,000 barcode primers can be handled by available pipetting robots. Under these assumptions, we investigated for 100,000 samples what number of barcodes per sample (k), number of barcode primers total (m), and number of pools per run (m2) would allow for minimal false-positive and false-negative rates of detection ( Fig. 2A-C) .",

To that end, one or several barcode sequences need to be inserted in the forward inner primer (FIP) or backward inner primer (BIP) primer used during the RT-LAMP reaction, which we experimentally validated. We consider that one limitation of the presented approach is that skewing of sample representation at the pooling stage may affect testing sensitivity. Although in initial tests, the LAMP reaction saturated in positive samples largely independently of template concentrations, thus potentially equalizing the representation across positive samples in an advantageous manner (Fig. 1E) , the reaction might also add random skewing to pooled samples; however, preliminary modeling suggested that pooling 100,000 samples per NextSeq run offers robust detection even assuming linear amplification of anticipated spread of viral loads (Supplementary Note 1). Remaining critical parameters to establish are the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP reaction using unpurified swab samples, the stability of RT-LAMP reactions during shipment, and, most importantly, the timely regulatory and ethical assessment of this novel testing approach for clinical validation.",

The RT-LAMP reaction with the swab is heated to 65 \u00b0C for 30 minutes to react, and to 95 \u00b0C for 10 minutes to sterilize.3. Up to 100,000 reactions are pooled in batches of 1,000 to 10,000 samples per batch.4. For each pool, a 12-cycle 100 \u00b5l PCR reaction is performed: \u00b5l of pooled RT-LAMP reactions pre-diluted 100-fold in water, e. water. 5. For each pool, a secondary 12-cycle 100 \u00b5l PCR reaction is performed with: a. 50 \u00b5l NEBNext 2x Master Mix (NEB), The PCR products are pooled, gel-purified, and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq sequencer, or similar device (A MiSeq sequencer can be used for testing the method, or when screening smaller numbers of samples). 7. Computationally, the barcodes co-occurring with the correct viral genome sequence excluding sequence portions covered by primers are determined.8. Positive samples are determined using a database of barcode combinations assigned to sample IDs, requiring either one (single barcoding scenario) or at least three out of five sample barcodes (compressed barcode space) being positive.DiscussionLAMP and RT-LAMP have been previously established for use as highly sensitive methods for pathogen detection from unpurified human samples with detection limits below 100 nucleic acid molecules. While colorimetric or turbidimetric(Mori and Notomi, 2009) readouts of LAMP reactions can suffer from false positive results(Estrela et al., 2019), we demonstrate that a sequencing-based readout detects correct fusions of barcode sequences with two stretches of",
