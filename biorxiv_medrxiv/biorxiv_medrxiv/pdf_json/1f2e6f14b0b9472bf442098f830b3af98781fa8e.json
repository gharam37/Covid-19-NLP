            "text": "The development of new drugs is costly, time consuming, and often accompanied with safety issues. Drug repurposing can avoid the expensive and lengthy process of drug development by finding new uses for already approved drugs. In order to repurpose drugs effectively, it is useful to know which proteins are targeted by which drugs. Computational models that estimate the interaction strength of new drug-target pairs have the potential to expedite drug repurposing. Several models have been proposed for this task. However, these models represent the drugs as strings, which is not a natural way to represent molecules. We propose a new model called GraphDTA that represents drugs as graphs and uses graph neural networks to predict drug-target affinity. We show that graph neural networks not only predict drug-target affinity better than non-deep learning models, but also outperform competing deep learning methods. Our results confirm that deep learning models are appropriate for drug-target binding affinity prediction, and that representing drugs as graphs can lead to further improvements. Availability of data and materials: The proposed models are implemented in Python. Related data, pre-trained models, and source code are publicly available at https://github.com/thinng/GraphDTA.

For example, the SimBoost model uses the affinity similarities among drugs and among targets to build new features. These features are then used as input in a gradient boosting machine to predict the binding affinity for unknown drug-target pairs [14] . Alternatively, the similarities could come from others sources (rather than the training data affinities). For example, kernel-based methods use kernels built from molecular descriptors of the drugs and targets within a regularized least squares regression (RLS) framework [15, 16] . To speed up model training, the KronRLS model computes a pairwise kernel K from the Kronecker product of the drug-by-drug and protein-by-protein kernels [15, 16] (for which any similarity measure can be used).",

For example, the DeepDTA model uses 1D representations and layers of 1D convolutions (with pooling) to capture predictive patterns within the data [17] . The final convolution layers are then concatenated, passed through a number of hidden layers, and regressed with the drug-target affinity scores. The WideDTA model is an extension of DeepDTA in which the sequences of the drugs and proteins are first summarized as higher-order features [18] . For example, the drugs are represented by the most common sub-structures (the Ligand Maximum Common Substructures (LMCS) [19] ), while the proteins are represented by the most conserved sub-sequences (the Protein Domain profiles or Motifs (PDM) from PROSITE [20] ). While WideDTA [18] and DeepDTA [17] learn a latent feature vector for each protein, the PADME model [21] uses fixed-rule descriptors to represent proteins, and performs similarly to DeepDTA [17] .",

Already, graph convolutional networks have been used in computational drug discovery, including interaction prediction, synthesis prediction, de novo molecular design, and quantitative structure prediction [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 22] .

The approach is based on the solution we submitted to the IDG-DREAM Drug-Kinase Binding Prediction Challenge 1 , where we were among the Top Ten Performers from 530 registered participants 2 . In order to better understand how our graph-based model works, we performed a multivariable statistical analysis of the model's latent space. We identified correlations between hidden node activations and domain-specific drug annotations, such as the number of aliphatic OH groups, which suggests that our graph neural network can automatically assign importance to welldefined chemical features without any prior knowledge. We also examine the model's performance and find that a handful of drugs contribute disproportionately to the total prediction error, and that these drugs are inliers (i.e., not outliers) in an ordination of the model's latent space. Taken together, our results suggest that graph neural networks are highly accurate, abstract meaningful concepts, and yet fail in predictable ways. We conclude with a discussion about how these insights can feedback into the research cycle.",

We convert the SMILES code to its corresponding molecular graph and extract atomic features using the open-source chemical informatics software RDKit [30] . It takes a drug-target pair as the input data, and the pair's affinity as the output data. It works in 3 stages. First, the SMILES code of a drug is converted into a molecular graph, and a deep learning algorithm learns a graph representation. Meanwhile, the protein sequence is encoded and embedded, and several 1D convolutional layers learn a sequence representation. Finally, the two representation vectors are concatenated and passed through several fully connected layers to estimate the output drug-target affinity value.",

The recent success of CNN in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing has encouraged research into graph convolution. A number of works have been proposed to handle two main challenges in generalizing CNN to graphs: (1) the formation of receptive fields in graphs whose data points are not arranged as Euclidean grids, and (2) the pooling operation to down-sample a graph. These new models are called graph neural networks.",

For the proteins, we use a string of ASCII characters and apply several 1D CNN layers over the text to learn a sequence representation vector. Specifically, the protein sequence is first categorically encoded, then an embedding layer is added to the sequence where each (encoded) character is represented by a 128-dimensional vector. Next, three 1D convolutional layers are used to learn different levels of abstract features from the input. Finally, a max pooling layer is applied to get a representation vector of the input protein sequence. This approach is similar to the existing baseline models. For the drugs, we use the molecular graphs and trial 4 graph neural network variants, including GCN [31] , GAT [32], GIN [33] , and a combined GAT-GCN architecture, all of which we describe below.",

For our goal, to estimate the drug-protein interaction, a graph-level representation of each drug is required.

We obtained the 128 latent variables from the graph neural network layer, and analyzed them directly through a redundancy analysis. This multivariable statistical method allows us to measure the percent of the total variance within the latent variables that can be explained by an external data source. In our case, the external data source is a matrix of 38 molecular JoeLib features/descriptors [37] for each drug (available from ChemMine Tools [38] ). We also compare the value of the principal components from these latent variables with the per-drug test set error. Here, the per-drug (or per-protein) error refers to the median of the absolute error between the predicted DTA and the ground-truth DTA for all test set pairs containing that drug (or that protein). For these analyses, we focus on the GIN model [33] (because of its superior performance) and the Kiba dataset [35] (because of its larger drug catalog).

The blue dots represent drugs, the yellow dots represent latent variables (with the top 6 labelled explicitly), and the arrows represent molecular descriptors (with the top 5 labelled explicitly). The right panel of the figure shows the activation of two latent variables plotted against the number of aliphatic OH groups in that drug. These results suggest that the graph convolutional network can abstract known molecular descriptors without any prior knowledge.",

It is tempting to also represent proteins in 3D due to the fact that 3D characteristics of drug molecules helps improve the performance of predicting drug-target binding affinity.
