            "text": "The global population is at present suffering from a pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by the novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The goals of this study were to use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict blueprints for designing universal vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, that contain a sufficiently broad repertoire of T-cell epitopes capable of providing coverage and protection across the global population. To help achieve these aims, we profiled the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome across the most frequent 100 HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR alleles in the human population, using host-infected cell surface antigen presentation and immunogenicity predictors from the NEC Immune Profiler suite of tools, and generated comprehensive epitope maps. We then used these epitope maps as input for a Monte Carlo simulation designed to identify statistically significant \"epitope hotspot\" regions in the virus that are most likely to be immunogenic across a broad spectrum of HLA types. We then removed epitope hotspots that shared significant homology with proteins in the human proteome to reduce the chance of inducing off-target autoimmune responses. We also analyzed the antigen presentation and immunogenic landscape of all the nonsynonymous mutations across 3400 different sequences of the virus, to identify a trend whereby SARS-COV-2 mutations are predicted to have reduced potential to be presented by host-infected cells, and consequently detected by the host immune system. A sequence conservation analysis then removed epitope hotspots that occurred in less-conserved regions of the viral proteome. Finally, we used a database of the HLA genotypes of approximately 22 000 individuals to develop a \"digital twin\" type simulation to model how effective different combinations of hotspots would work in a diverse human population, and used the approach to identify an optimal constellation of epitopes hotspots that could provide maximum coverage in the global population. By combining the antigen presentation to the infected-host cell surface and immunogenicity predictions of the NEC Immune Profiler with a robust Monte Carlo and digital twin simulation, we have managed to profile the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome and identify a subset of epitope hotspots that could be harnessed in a vaccine formulation to provide a broad coverage across the global population.",

            "text": "The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its rapid worldwide transmission resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring COVID-19 as a pandemic and global health emergency. COVID-19 is caused by the novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] . Like all coronaviridae, SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense RNA viruse encapsulated by an envelope, and characterized by an exposed spike glycoprotein (S-protein) that is projected from the viral surface and comprises a large RNA genome [2] . Although the main structural proteins on coronaviridae, such as the S-protein, are reasonably well studied, many of the other proteins are less well characterized. Correcting this gap may be important to improve the design of therapeutic interventions [3] . This particular gap in knowledge is very relevant from the perspective of finding immunogenic targets across the entire virus proteome, in order to guide the design of effective vaccines. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is closely related in sequence identity and receptor binding to SARS-CoV [4, 5] , and therefore it has been purported that one may borrow from this similarity to validate targets in potential vaccines [6, 7] . Much of the emphasis on coronaviridae vaccines to date has focused on antibody responses against the Sprotein, which is the most \"antibody exposed\" structural protein in the virus.",

Considering the potential for ADE, the reported short-lived antibody response [9, 10, 14] , and the documented pathological consequence of S-protein specific antibodies in certain animal models, it is worth considering alternative strategies for vaccine development that drive T-cell responses from targets other than the S-protein when designing vaccines to combat coronaviridae infections.",

Several studies have demonstrated in SARS-CoV that virus specific CD8 T cells are required for mounting an effective immune response and viral clearance [9, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . A vaccine design that confers optimal protection may also need to involve the generation of memory T cell responses [20] . It has been shown that the activation of memory T cells specific for a conserved epitope shared by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is a potential strategy for developing coronavirus vaccines [21] . In addition, levels of memory T cell responses to SARS-CoV against peptides from its structural proteins were detected in a proportion of SARS-recovered patients, several years after infection [22, 23] . However, an adequate T cell response in isolation may not be sufficient.",

Taken together, this supports the approach taken in this study, which is to map computationally, a broad epitope landscape across the global viral SARS-CoV-2 proteome, which includes integrated CD8, CD4 and B cell targets in the modeling. There has been some preliminary efforts submitted into preprint servers recently that describe epitope maps generated [29] [30] [31] , however it appears that the emphasis in those approaches were based mostly on HLA binding. It is important to profile in whole viral proteome epitope screens, as carried out in this study using an extensive artificial intelligence platform, not only the candidates that may bind to the HLA molecule but also those CD8 epitopes that are naturally processed by the cell's antigen processing machinery, and presented on the surface of the infected host cells. Layered on top of the antigen presentation predictions in the host infected cells, we also make predictions across the entire viral proteome that measure the likelihood that the peptides presented on the host infected cells are capable of being recognized by T cells that are not yet tolerized or deleted from a patient's T cell repertoire. The subsequent immunogenic landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 that we present here is taken further to analyze the immunogenicity of all the non-synonymous variations across approximately 3400 different SARS-CoV-2 sequences, to map author/funder.

Antigen presentation (AP) was predicted from a machine-learning model that integrates in an ensemble machine learning layer information from several HLA binding predictors (in the case three distinct HLA binding predictors trained on ic50nm binding affinity data) and 13 different predictors of antigen processing (all trained on mass spectrometry data). The outputted AP score ranges from 0 to 1, and was used as input to compute immune presentation (IP) across the epitope map. The IP score penalizes those presented peptides that have degrees of \"similarity to human\" when compared against the human proteome, and awards peptides that are less similar. The resulting IP score represents those HLA presented peptides that are likely to be recognized by circulating T-cells in the periphery i.e. T-cells that have not been deleted or tolerized, and therefore most likely to be immunogenic. Both the AP and the IP epitope predictions are \"pan\" HLA or HLA-agnostic and can be carried out for any allele in the human population, however for the purpose of this study we limited the analysis to the 100 of the most frequent HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR alleles in the human population. Class II HLA binding predictions were also incorporated into the large scale epitope screen from the IEDB consensus of tools [33] , and B cell epitope predictions were performed using BepiPred [33] .",

It is clear from Figure 1 that different HLA alleles have different Class I AP (and IP), and Class II binding properties. This strongly suggests, as one might anticipate, that the SARS-CoV-2 antigen presentation landscape (and IP) clusters into distinct population groups across the spectrum of different human HLA alleles. This trend is further illustrated in the hierarchichal-clustering map presented Figure 2 after the AP scores have been binarized. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that some allelic clusters present many viral targets to the human immune system, while others only present a few targets, and some are unable to present any. This implies that different groups in the human population with different HLA's will respond differentially to a T cell driven vaccine composed of viral peptides. Therefore in order to design the optimal vaccine that leverages the benefits of T cell immunity across a broad human population we need to predict \"epitope hotspots\" in viral proteome. These hotspots are regions of the virus that are enriched for overlapping epitopes, and/or epitopes in close spatial proximity, that can be recognized by multiple HLA types across the human population.",

We identified class I epitopes from the original SARS-CoV virus (that first emerged in the Guangdong province in China in 2002) that shared \u226590% sequence identity with the current SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, many of the published epitopes were identified using ELISPOT on PBMCs from convalescent patients and/or healthy donors (or humanised mouse models) where the restricting HLA was not explicitly deconvoluted. In order to circumvent this problem, we identified a subset of 5 epitopes where the minimal epitopes and HLA restriction had been identified using tetramers [6] .

Three bin sizes were investigated for potential epitope hotspots; 27, 50 and 100. A statistic was calculated for each defined subset region of the protein (bin) from the set of 100 HLAs. The Monte Carlo simulation method was then used to estimate the p-values for each bin, whereby each bin represented a candidate epitope hotspot. The statistically significant bins that emerged from the simulation represented epitope hotspot or regions of interest for each protein analyzed. Epitope hotspots are built on the individual epitope scores, epitope lengths, and for each amino acid that they comprise. These scores are generated for each amino acid in the hotspots for all of the 100 HLA alleles most frequent in the human population. Based on the Monte Carlo analysis, the significant hotspots are those below a 5% false discovery rate (FDR), and represent regions that are most likely to contain viable T cell driven vaccine targets that can be recognized by multiple HLA types across the human population. A summary of the epitope hotspots identified across the entire spectrum of the virus is depicted in Figure 3 and reveals that the most immunogenic regions of the virus, that target the most frequent Human HLA alleles in the global population, are found in several of the viral proteins above and beyond the antibody exposed structural proteins, such as the S-protein.",

A universal vaccine blueprint should ideally also be able to protect populations against different emerging clades of the SARS-COV-2 virus and we therefore compared the AP potential of approximately 3400 virus sequences in the GISAID database against the AP potential of the Wuhan Genbank reference sequence.

Even after filtering for conservation and self-similarity we were left with over 50 different hotpots for both the AP and IP based analyses. In order to develop a blueprint for viable universal vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to 1) cover with fidelity a broad proportion of the human population, and 2) prioritize the selection to even fewer regions (the exact number may depend on the size of the bin and the vaccine platform under consideration). Consequently, we need to identify the optimal constellation of hotspots, or relevant viral segments, that can provide broad coverage in the human population with a limited and targeted vaccine \"payload\". In order to achieve this aim, we developed and applied (see Materials and Methods) a \"digital twin\" method, which models the specific HLA background of different geographical populations and used the method to identify optimal clusters of immunogenic epitope hotspots that will induce immunity in the broad human population. A graph-based mathematical optimization approach is then used to select the optimal combination of immunogenic epitope hotspots that will induce immunity in the broad human population. The results of this analysis are shown in Figure 7 . The output clearly identified a subset of hotspots that may be combined to stimulate a robust immune response in a broad global population.

To help achieve this ambitious aim, we have profiled the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome across the most frequent 100 HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR alleles in the human population and generated comprehensive epitope maps. We subsequently used these epitope maps as the basis for modeling the specific genetic HLA background of individual persons in a diverse set of different human populations using the most significant CD8 and CD4 T cell \"epitope hotspots\" in the virus. To the best of our knowledge this is the first computational approach that generates comprehensive vaccine design blueprints from large-scale epitope maps of SARS-CoV-2, in a manner that optimizes for diverse T cell immune responses across the global population. Underlying this approach are two novel methods that when integrated together result in a solution that is uniquely suited to achieving the objective of the study i.e. designing blueprints for universal vaccines. Firstly, a framework that leverages Monte Carlo simulations was developed to identify statistically significant epitope hotspot regions in the virus that are most likely to be immunogenic across a broad spectrum of HLA types. Secondly, a novel person-specific or \"digital twin\" type simulation using the actual HLA genotypes of approximately 22, 000 individuals prioritizes these epitope hotspots, to identify the optimal constellation of vaccine hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome that are most likely to promote a robust T cell immune response in the global population.",

The software outputs a consensus sequence that contains conservation information for each amino acid within the protein sequence. As such, an amino acid depicted as an \"*\" at position i within the consensus sequence translates to that amino acid being conserved at position i among all the input sequences [40] The hotspot offsets were then used to extract their respective consensus subsequence. For each hotspot, the conservation score was calculated as the ratio of \"*\" within its consensus sub-sequence to the total length of the sub-sequence.",

Then, the log likelihood of response for a citizen is the sum of all active incoming edges. That is, the flow from selected vaccine elements to the citizens gives the likelihood of no response for that citizen.This definition does not include V in the conditioning set of the likelihood. Thus, it does not account for interactions among vaccine elements, such as immunodominance.Calculating the likelihood of no response for a given digital twin and vaccine elements. We now describe example approaches for calculating log ! ! = \u2212 ! ! , ! ! for three types of vaccine elements.

We then take log2. Long peptide sequences. Longer peptide sequences may include multiple short peptide sequences with different scores from the prediction engine. An example approach to calculate log ! ! = \u2212 ! ! , ! ! , where v is the long peptide sequence, is to take the minimum (i.e., best) log ! ! = \u2212 !, ! ! , where p is any short peptide contained in ! ! .3.
