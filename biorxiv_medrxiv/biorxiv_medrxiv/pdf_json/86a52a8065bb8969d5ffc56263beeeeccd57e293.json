The difference between the epidemiological profile and first laboratory examination results of COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients were compared and analyzed by multiple logistic regression.

Multiple logistic regression analysis showed age, contact history and decreasing lymphocyte count could be used as individual factor that has diagnostic value (p<0.05). The AUC of first RT-PCR test was 0.84 (95% CI 0.73-0.89), AUC of cumulative two times of RT-PCR tests was 0.92 (95% CI 0.88-0.96) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.99) for cumulative three times of RT-PCR tests. Ninety-six patients showed typical pneumonia radiological features in first CT scan, AUC was 0.74 (95% CI 0.60-0.73). The AUC of patients' age, contact history with confirmed people and the decreased lymphocytes were 0.66 (95% CI 0.60-0.73), 0.67 (95% CI 0.61-0.73), 0.62 (95% CI 0.56-0.69), respectively.

However, the positive rate of first test is low, which means there is high false negative rate, research (12, 14) shows the positive rate of first nucleic acid RT-PCR test of COVID-19 patients is only around 30-50%. Repeated tests are often conducted in clinical work to increase the positive rate, but in-depth study on diagnostic accuracy have not been carried out. A recent research(15) shows the median time from COVID-19 patient's symptom onset to nucleic acid RT-PCR test positive is 20 days, the shortest time is 8 days, and the longest time is 20 days. It is a disadvantage for early diagnosis of this disease when there is a relatively high false negative rate of nucleic acid RT-PCR test and there is also a relatively long time period from symptom onset to test positive. Especially when human-to-human transmission has been clearly acknowledged, such disadvantage makes it difficult for disease control (9) .

With AUC = 0.724 also shows that independent chest CT diagnosis has medium diagnostic value. Multiple logistic regression analysis result shows that patient's age, contact history and decrease in lymphocyte count have independent diagnostic value of COVID-19. Although these indicator's diagnosis efficiency is relatively low (0.5 < AUC \u2264 0.7), combining chest CT result with age, contact history and decrease in lymphocyte can have a similar diagnosis accuracy with first nucleic acid test (AUC = 0.859). Therefore, these indicators are of great reference importance when nucleic acid RT-PCR test provides false negative result, or before the disease can be detected by nucleic acid RT-PCR test. By combing chest CT result with age, contact history and decrease in lymphocyte to diagnose COVID-19, miss diagnosis rate can be significantly reduced. In clinical work, when diagnosing patients with respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, and sputum, the patient's chest CT imaging features should be paid attention to. Moreover, patient's age should be fully concerned; patient's anamnesis and epidemiological history (travel history in epidemic area, contact history with people from epidemic area or with confirmed cases) should be carefully inquired; and patient's lymphocyte count of blood routine test should be taken into consideration as well. This study further finds that age older than 41.5 years old and lymphocyte count lower than 1.53\u00d710 9 /L are the threshold diagnostic numbers for age and lymphocyte count respectively.

Nucleic acid RT-PCR test is the diagnosis basis of confirming COVID-19, but the first-time test has relatively high false negative rate. Diagnosing suspected cases before they are test confirmed can only rely on patient's clinical characteristics, chest CT imaging features and laboratory test results. Therefore, this study's conclusion provides a reliable theoretical basis for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Respiratory infection symptoms such as fever and cough, typical chest CT imaging features, middle aged and elderly patients (age > 41.5 years), lymphocyte count lower than 1.53\u00d710 9 /L should be considered linked to COVID-19. If there is available travel history in epidemic area or contact history with people form epidemic area or with confirmed patients, that could provide another strong evidence for diagnosing COVID-19. For these patients, isolation and medical treatment should be carried out as early as possible, which would be helpful for better control of the infection and cut off the transmission at an early stage. Moreover, this study's first-time nucleic acid RT-PCR tests have a test positive rate of 68%, which is higher than previous study (14, 16) (positive rate 30-50%). It may be related to the fact that the nucleic acid test samples were collected and stored by specialized personnel in our hospital who had received professional training. Which indicates that nucleic acid test in strict accordance with operating procedures, careful sample storage and transfer procedures can increase the positive rate of first-time nucleic acid test, All rights reserved.

This study's result is helpful for early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment of the patients, and can also play an important role in better epidemic control. However, this study has certain limitations. Firstly, this study's sample size is limited, which may lead to some bias in the research result. Secondly, this study only studies on patient's chest CT results before hospitalization, blood routine test results and first routine laboratory test results after hospitalization. Other indicators that may have diagnostic value for early diagnosis might be missed. Thirdly, previous research (15) shows few patients can have longest time period of 38 days from symptom onset to nucleic acid tested positive.",
