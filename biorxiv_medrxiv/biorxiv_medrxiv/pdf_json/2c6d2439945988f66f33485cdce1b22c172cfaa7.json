An open question is, what is the share of infections that are undetected under current testing guidelines? To answer this question, we turn to COVID-19 testing data from Iceland. The criteria for testing within the Icelandic medical system, processed by the National University Hospital of Iceland (NUHI), have also been targeted at high-risk individuals, but additionally most Icelanders qualify for voluntary testing through the biopharmaceutical company deCODE genetics. We use results from Iceland's two testing programs to estimate the share of infections that are undetected under standard (NUHI) testing guidelines. Because of complications in the deCODE testing regime, it is not possible to estimate a single value for this this undetected rate; however, a range can be estimated. Our primary estimates for the fraction of infections that are undetected range from 88.7% to 93.6%.",

Because deCODE test recipients did not meet the quarantine requirements (returning from high-risk countries or close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 individual), this assumption seems plausible; it cannot be evaluated with existing data, however. Data to provide unbiased estimates of the undetected rate, and the overall rate of infection in the population, need to come from random testing. Such trials are commencing in Iceland, Germany, and Norway. If a random testing design excludes those eligible for tests under medically-based guidelines and/or those in quarantine, the combined data sets could be analyzed using the methods laid out here. 5 Only in Icelandic: https://www.landlaeknir.is/servlet/file/store93/item32967/influensulik.einkenni.uppfaersla.a.vef. okt2017.AG.xls_%C3%A1n%20myndar%20og%20aldursdreifingu.xls .
