The absence of NFkB inhibitory drugs from the human formulary is due to most candidate drugs being either neurotoxic or nephrotoxic when administered chronically 9 . One drug that lacks these toxicities is the cardiac glycoside digitoxin. We have previously shown digitoxin to be among the most potent inhibitors of the proinflammatory TNFa/NFkB pathway in the human airway and in other epithelial cells, both in vitro 9 , and in vivo [11] [12] [13] . Corroborating this is a screen of 2800 drugs and bioactive compounds which found digitoxin to be the 2nd most potent inhibitor of TNFa/NFkB activity 14 . Digitoxin has been a drug to treat heart failure for decades, and is safe for children and adults with normal hearts 15 . In a clinical trial of digitoxin administered to young adults with the proinflammatory lung disease cystic fibrosis, digitoxin was safe 13. The study showed \"the mRNAs encoding chemokine/cytokine or cell surface receptors in immune cells were decreased in nasal epithelial cells...leading to pathway-mediated reductions in IL-8, IL-6, lung epithelial inflammation, neutrophil recruitment and mucus hypersecretion.\" 13 .",

Animals were given four different doses of digitoxin, starting one day prior to virus administration and continuing until sacrifice on day 7. The maximum dose of digitoxin, 30 \u00b5g/kg, was calculated to be similar to the human dose routinely used to treat heart failure. As shown in Figure 1 , protein data were collected for IFNg (Interferon gamma); (Transforming Growth Factor beta). As summarized in Table 1 , digitoxin-dependent changes in protein were found to be significant for 6 of the 7 cytokines. The digitoxin-dependent reductions are specific and saturating for each cytokine, but do not reduce any of them to zero. Table 1 shows that the greatest significant digitoxin-dependent reductions in cytokine proteins were found for IFNg (68.9%), GRO/KC (46.6%), and MCP1 (54.9%). Smaller but still significant reductions in cytokine proteins were found for MIP2 (32.2%) and TNFa (38.4%). As also shown in Table 1 , a significant reduction of only 15.3% was found for TGFb cytokine protein at a concentration of 3 \u00b5g/kg, while only trending significance was noted at higher digitoxin concentrations. In the case of IL-1b only the highest digitoxin concentration trended towards significance. Thus digitoxin independently, dose-dependently and significantly lowers the individual concentrations in the lung of at least these six cytokines which have been induced by viral exposure.",
