It remains unknown how late-life social isolation impacts cognition and affective behavior in aged mice. We assessed the impact of late-life social isolation in 18-month old female mice. One month of single-housing did not lead to robust depressive-like symptomology, altered social interaction behavior, or sensitivity to context fear acquisition or memory. Rather, isolation increased hyperactivity and exploration, and reduced anxiety-like behavior in the open field and elevated plus maze, findings that have been similarly observed in young female and male mice following early-life isolation. These findings suggest that hyperactivity is a robust behavior following social isolation across the lifespan.",

Rodent models have focused on the effects of single-housing isolation-induced stress during critical developmental periods in adolescents and early adulthood (Arakawa, 2018) , and typically report increases in depressive-like and anxietylike behaviors (Berry et al., 2012; Ieraci et al., 2016) . Early-life single-housing studies find differential effects of isolation across sex, with females showing less anxiety-like behaviors, and inconsistent memory deficits (Rodgers & Cole, 1993; Bartolomucci et al., 2003; An et al., 2017) . Early-life isolation also leads to hyperactivity and increased exploratory behavior, suggesting that isolation may have an anxiolytic effect in young animals (Ashby et al., 2010; Fei et al., 2019) . The behavioral impact of social isolation may depend upon the developmental time point of isolation, sex, and duration of isolation.",

The other cage remained empty during the trial. The test mouse was placed in the center chamber and allowed 5 min to habituate to the chamber. The sliding doors were then raised, the mouse was allowed to freely explore all three chambers of the arena for an additional 5 min.

High activity was defined by the SMART behavioral analysis software as \u2265 15% change in pixels between serial video frames during the task. Lower periods of activity are indicative of a learned helplessness phenotype or depressive-like behavior. Context Fear Conditioning and Testing (CFC): Fear conditioning was conducted in a chamber (19 cm \u00d7 20 cm \u00d7 128 cm) with shock-grid floors (bars 3.2 mm in diameter spaced 7.9 mm apart), clear acrylic front and back walls, and aluminum side-walls and roof (Coulborn Instruments). Mice were allowed 2 min to explore the chamber, then received 3 foot shocks (0.5 mA, 2 sec duration, 1 min apart). Mice were removed from the chambers 1 min after the last shock. Twenty-four hours later, the mouse was replaced in the conditioning chamber and freezing behavior was recorded for 3 min. Freezing is a species-specific defense reaction that is typically used as a measure of fear in rodents. Behavior in the chamber was recorded by an overhead camera, and activity levels were analyzed using Freezeframe software (Actimetrix, RRID:SCR_014429).",

Young male mice exhibit stronger exploratory behavior in the EPM than females following isolation (Guo et al.,2004) , however further studies are needed to determine if these sex differences would be preserved following late-life isolation in a larger sample size. Isolated aged mice displayed less anxiety-like behavior in the OF, travelling into the center of the arena more than group-housed animals. In the EPM, this same risk-taking behavior was not observed, with all mice spending equivalent time in the closed arms of the maze. Previous studies have reported decreased (Guo et al., 2004; Flanigan & Cook, 2011) and comparable (Rodgers & Cole, 1993) anxiety-like behaviors in isolated young mice on the EPM.",

Understanding the behavioral impacts of latelife isolation is especially relevant given the current self-isolation recommendations, particularly for females whose are more likely than males to live alone. By identifying behavioral disturbances in behavior following isolation the results will be useful for informing the likely cognitive and psychological impact of isolation in response to the recent social isolation experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Periphery is defined as the area within 10 cm from the edge of the wall. The middle zone is defined as the area 5 cm between the periphery and center zone. The center zone is the 15 cm\u00b2 area within the middle of the arena. Preference for the periphery of the arena is indicative of an anxiety-like phenotype. 3-Chambered Social Interaction Task (SI): The social interaction arena consists of three equally sized clear acrylic chambers (43 cm x 20 cm x 23 cm each chamber) connected by a sliding door on either side of the center chamber.
