[3] [4] [5] Crucially, however, the relative importance of these routes remains unknown. Significant infection has also occurred in hospitals. According to China CDC Weekly 2020, 6 1,716 of the 44,672 Covid-19 cases confirmed in China by 11 February 2020 were in healthcare workers.

Our detection of more positive surface samples in the bathroom suggests that these samples may be faecal in origin. The previous detection of the virus in stools 3-5 provides support for this interpretation, as does the fact that stools obtained from the first Covid-19 patient in the United States also tested positive. 7 Zhang et al. 5 also found that there were more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in the later stage of infection, and diarrhoea and nausea prior to fever and dyspnoea also presented in approximately 10% of the patients in Wuhan. 8 High levels of viral load have also been detected in stool in SARS-CoV patients. 9 Our detection of positive surface samples on one toilet ceiling-exhaust grille in a bathroom suggests that fine virus particles existed in that bathroom. However, little is known about the aerosol concentration in the bathrooms in this hospital. Deposition on exhaust grille surfaces can be a result of either long-term deposition of low-concentration particles in the air or fast deposition of high-concentration particles. It has also be confirmed that aerosols may be generated during toilet flushing. 10 A patient's hands can also be contaminated during his/her toilet usage. Toilet bowl and sink surface samples also tested positive in a Singaporean hospital. 11 In addition to toilet flushing-generated aerosols, Yu et al 12 found that SARS-CoV bio-aerosols were generated in drainage stacks after patients flushed the toilet in the 2003 Amoy Garden outbreak.",

Thus, the personal spaces of these patients overlap in the toilet area, and thus are likely to generate an additive contamination effect, and may explain why the toilet surfaces were particularly likely to be positive. Nevertheless, the duration of a patient's stay in the toilet is brief as only mild-symptomatic patients stayed on this floor. Additionally, the surface material or finish inside the toilets may allow a better transfer during sampling by swabs. In this context, it is known that there is generally a higher surfacetouch transfer rate from smooth to rough surfaces, and most toilet surfaces are made to be smooth . 13 We failed to detect any viruses on non-toilet object surfaces in the patients' rooms, unlike in a 2020 study by Ong et al, 11 who detected 13/15 (87%) positive samples in one patient's room, and 3/5 (60%) in toilet sites, although anteroom and corridor samples were negative.

We characterised the airflow pattern in the hospital zone using incense smoke, which revealed that there was a weak flow from all isolation rooms to their shared corridor, as shown in Figure S1 . This showed that despite the continuous operation of a relatively strong exhaust fan in all isolation rooms' bathrooms, none of these rooms had negative pressure. Thus, it is possible that leakage of aerosols from the isolation rooms to the corridor occurred. Airborne aerosols may have also been released from the protective clothing worn by healthcare workers into the environment in the multi-function room. We were not able to quantitatively measure the airflow in that zone.",

Among surfaces in a patient ward, such as a bench, bedside rail, locker, bedside table, alcohol dispenser, and windowsill, Cheng et al 15 found that only the windowsill sample (1/13) was positive for SARS-CoV-2, while the viral load of the patients was 3\u00b73 \uf0b4 10 6 copies per mL in the pooled nasopharyngeal sample and throat swab and 5\u00b79 \uf0b4 10 6 copies per mL in saliva.",

On 8 February, we collected 60 samples, comprising nine air samples (with the QuickTake30, MD-8, and ASE-100) and 51 surface samples. On 20 February, we collected 29 air samples (with the MD-8, ASE-100, and WA-15), two exhaled condensate samples, two exhaled air samples, and 50 surface samples. On 22 February, we collected eight air samples (using the MD-8 and ASE-100) and six surface samples. Environmental sample detection included nucleic acid extraction (NP968, Tianlong Science & Technology, Xi'an, China), and amplification by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; Applied Biosystems QuantStudio Dx (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). Detection of the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was done using real-time RT-PCR kit from Shanghai Chromysky Medical Research Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). According to the instructions provided by the company, each sample was run in duplicate by RT-PCR. The patient sample was analysed by The Second Hospital of Nanjing using Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). The nucleic acid detection reagents were from Huada Biotechnology (Wuhan) Co., Ltd. A sample is positive when CT \uf0a3 38, and weak positive when 37 \uf0a3CT \uf0a3 38.",
