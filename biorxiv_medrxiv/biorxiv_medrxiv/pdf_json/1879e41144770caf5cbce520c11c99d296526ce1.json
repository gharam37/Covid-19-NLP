RT-PCR and inoculation 36 of Morelia viridis cell cultures served to recruit the cases and to obtain virus isolates. 37 Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining against nidovirus nucleoprotein 38 demonstrated that the virus not only infects a broad spectrum of epithelial (respiratory and 39 alimentary epithelium, hepatocytes, renal tubules, pancreatic ducts etc.), but also intravascular 40 monocytes, intralesional macrophages and endothelial cells. By next-generation sequencing we 41 obtained full length genome for a novel nidovirus species circulating in Switzerland. Analysis of 42 viral genomes recovered from pythons showing nidovirus infection-associated respiratory or 43 systemic disease did not explain the observed phenotypes. The results indicate that python 44 nidoviruses have a broad cell and tissue tropism, further suggesting that the course of infection 45 could vary and involve lesions in a broad spectrum of tissues and organ systems as a 46 consequence of monocyte-mediated systemic spread of the virus. 47 48 author/funder.

Nidoviruses represent a threat to captive snake collections, as they spread rapidly and 51 can be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our study indicates that, different from 52 previously evidence, the viruses do not only affect the respiratory tract, but can spread in the 53 entire body with blood monocytes, have a broad spectrum of target cells, and can induce a 54 variety of lesions. Nidovirales is an order of animal and human viruses that compromise 55 important zoonotic pathogens such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, as well as the recently 56 emerged SARS-CoV-2. Python nidoviruses belong to the same subfamily as the mentioned 57 human viruses and show similar characteristics (rapid spread, respiratory and gastrointestinal 58 tropism, etc.). The present study confirms the relevance of natural animal diseases to better 59 understand the complexity of viruses of the order nidovirales.",

These findings and the fact that nidovirus infections affect several python 88 species led us to the hypothesis that python nidoviruses are not restricted to a certain species and 89 have a broad disease potential. Therefore, we undertook a larger study, making use of diagnostic (Table 1 ) as described (6). 168 Library preparation, data analysis, and genome assembly was done as described (6). 169 To study the frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within samples, the NGS 170 reads were quality filtered using Trimmomatic and the reads with Q-score over 30 were 171 assembled against the consensus sequence of a given sample using the BWA-MEM algorithm 172 (15) followed by removal of potential PCR duplicates using SAMTools version 1.8 (16).

Most snakes that had died 198 spontaneously exhibited the typical, previously described respiratory changes, represented by a 199 varying amount of mucoid material in the airways and particularly in the lungs (Fig. 1A) . In 200 some animals, the oral cavity, the trachea, the lung and the air sacs were filled with mucoid 201 material and the lung parenchyma appeared thickened (nidovirus-associated proliferative 202 disease; Fig.1A) ; also, the mucoid material was occasionally mixed with purulent exudate. Two 203 euthanized carpet pythons with clinically reported respiratory distress (CH-B1 and -B2, Table 1) 204 did not exhibit any gross pulmonary changes, but showed mild mucus accumulation in the oral 205 cavity. In others, granulomatous and/or fibrinonecrotic lesions were observed in the oral, Table 1 . Oral cavity and respiratory tract. The respiratory tract was found to be affected in all animals and degenerated oral and nasal epithelial cells (Fig. 1D ). In two euthanized carpet pythons (CH-221 B1 and -B2, Table 1 ), these were the only pathological changes, suggesting that they represented 222 early (initial) lesions. The latter is further supported by the fact that in one of the two individuals disease.

The present study aimed to further elucidate the characteristics 387 and relevance of python nidoviruses. Particular emphasis was laid on the potential species 388 specificity of and/or susceptibility to the viruses, their phylogeny and geographic divergence as 389 well as viral shedding and transmission, host cell tropism and type of associated disease. 390 Experimental infection has been shown to reproduce the naturally occurring respiratory disease 391 (7), so our study focused on natural cases from different geographic regions, from breeding 392 colonies that often kept several python species, and from colonies that at least partly worked 393 closely together, exchanging animals.

In support, the analysis of the viral 410 genomes by NGS did not show differences in the viral genome that would explain the 411 differences in the disease manifestation. One could speculate that each python species has its 412 own nidovirus, and that cross-species transmission of the viruses results in morbidity.

Therefore, we conducted a more detailed 320 recombination analysis. This analysis suggested at least five highly supported recombination 321 events.322    Morelia viridis nidovirus isolates BH171/14-7 and BH128/14-12 (33) cluster together with 323 Serpentovirinae sp. isolate L1 based on 5' and 3' ends of the genome (corresponding to324 nucleotides 1-14704 and 36100-37869 in the alignment), whereas based on nucleotides 14705-325 25143 and 27808-36099 these strains cluster together with Serpentovirinae sp. isolate H0-1 326 (MN161564), and between nucleotides 25144 and 27807 together with strain CH-F1 327 (MK722373) (Fig 7B). Likewise, strain CH-F1 clusters together with Serpentovirinae sp. isolate 328 L1 and BH171/14-7 on the basis of nucleotides 1-10094 but together with 329 MK722375_Python_regius based on the 3' end of the genome (Fig 7C). This suggests that the 330 Serpentovirinae sp. isolate L1 (MN161567) has been involved in at least two distinct 331 recombination events. Although these four isolates (Serpentovirinae sp. isolate L1, Morelia 332 viridis nidovirus isolates BH171/14-7 and BH128/14-12 and strain CH-F1) cluster together in 333 the 5'end of the genome, the genetic distances between these strains are rather high in this 334 region, suggesting that the exact recombination partners are not represented in the dataset. Since 335 Serpentovirinae sp. isolate L1 was sequenced from a Python regius in the USA in 2015 (14), 336 Sequential exclusion of recombinant regions from the alignment (i.e. nucleotides 1-14704 and 345 25144-37869) resulted in the tree shown in Figure 7E. Although some of the methods included 346 in RDP4 analysis still found evidence of recombination in this alignment, the further removal of 347 these regions did not affect the topology of the tree. 348 The phylogenetic tree indicated that multiple viral strains circulate among the snakes of a single 349 breeder and, on the other hand, there are some indications of viral transmission between the 350 breeders, as exemplified by the high similarity of strains CH-B1, CH-B3 (breeder CH-B) and 351 CH-E2 (breeder CH-E). 352 The breeders CH-A, CH-B, CH-C and CH-F exchanged animals, which may explain the 353 grouping of strains CH-C3, CH-A7, CH-E2, CH-B1, CH-B3, CH-B5 and CH-A8 to a single 354 cluster. Notably, no recombination events were detected between the newly detected nidovirus 355 species and the previously characterized Morelia viridis nidovirus, python nidovirus and ball 356 python nidovirus (Fig 7E), suggesting that recombination occurs only within virus species but 357 not between species. 358 Evidence of horizontal transmission within colonies and of virus shedding from diseased 359 animals 360 One Swiss breeder (CH-B,Table 1) lost one of three juvenile carpet pythons from the same 361 clutch that had been housed separate from each other, but in the same room (distance less than362 0.5 m), to severe fatal proliferative pneumonia (CH-B4). The post mortem examination 363 confirmed nidovirus-associated pneumonia in the deceased animal, prompting the breeder to 364 submit the two siblings (CH-B1 and -B2, Table 1) for euthanasia and diagnostic post mortem 365 examination. Both individuals exhibited nidovirus-associated lesions in the upper airways but 366 not in the lung, suggesting that these cases represented an early disease stage following airborne 367 infection.",

An alternative explanation for the emergence of nidovirus infections in 416 python collections could be that there have been multiple nidovirus introductions to various 417 python species from an unknown host species or a vector. 418 Recently, experimental infection of ball pythons established the causal relationship between 419 nidovirus infection and mucinous inflammation of the upper respiratory and the gastrointestinal 420 tract as the main pathological process early, i.e. within the first 12 weeks, after infection (7).421 Infected pythons showed severe respiratory distress with only minimal pneumonia, most likely 422 because the mucus overproduction resulted in obstruction of the upper airways (7). These 423 findings correlate with those we made when studying naturally infected cases; some animals 424 were submitted for euthanasia due to acute respiratory distress, but only exhibited inflammatory nidoviruses for which the results of the present study indicate a rather broad cell tropism, for 459 various types of epithelia (respiratory and pulmonary epithelium, enterocytes, hepatocytes, 460 epithelial cells in renal tubules and pancreatic ducts) and ependymal cells. Interestingly, a similar 461 tendency is described for SARS-CoV-2 (54). Previous studies on python nidoviruses have hinted 462 at a broader target cell spectrum, but did so far not go beyond the detection of nidovirus RNA in 463 organs other than the respiratory tract (10), and did neither identify infected cells nor correlate 464 infection with actual organ lesions. 465 Of particular interest is the fact that python nidoviruses also infect non-epithelial cells distributed 466 over the entire body. We detected nidovirus NP in endothelial cells, intravascular monocytes and 467 extravascular macrophages within inflammatory processes. The latter suggest that monocytes 468 facilitate the systemic spread of the virus. So far, viruses of the subfamily Tobaniviridae have 469 not been reported to infect monocytes/macrophages. However, monocyte/macrophage infection 470 is known to be a key process in the pathogenesis of other members of the order Nidovirales, such 471 as feline coronaviruses (FCoV) (55), ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV) (56) and Severe 472 Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (57). For FCoV, the ability to infect, 473 replicate in and activate monocytes and macrophages is essential in the pathogenesis of feline 474 infectious peritonitis (FIP), a fatal disease of felids. While the low-virulence feline enteric 475 coronavirus (FECV) biotype primarily replicates in enterocytes and does only induce mild 476 Similar to cats with FIP, systemically nidovirus-infected pythons exhibited a multifocal 484 macrophage-dominated vasculitis which was in severe cases associated with fibrinoid necrosis of 485 the vessel wall, but also appeared as chronic perivascular (pyo)granulomatous cuffs with 486 abundant nidovirus-positive macrophages. These vascular lesions could result from an 487 interaction between activated nidovirus-infected monocytes and endothelial cells, in particular 488 since the latter were also found to become infected. They might also be responsible for the broad 489 spectrum of granulomatous to fibrinonecrotic lesions in organs, since these might at least partly 490 be of ischemic nature. 491 Sequencing of the nidovirus genomes did not reveal variants that would be associated with the 492 systemic infection observed in some individuals. The genome length and relatively high 493 mutation and recombination rate of nidoviruses makes identification of mutations that might 494 alter the pathogenesis of the virus rather challenging. The S protein is the precursor of the spike 495 complex that mediates receptor binding and entry, and thus mutations in the S protein could most 496 easily explain the differences in tissue tropism (62). However, we did not identify S protein 497 mutations that would explain the different phenotypes. One could thus speculate that the 498 different infection outcome is a consequence of differences in the host immune response. 499 During viral infections of mammals, viruses are recognized by pattern recognition receptors 500 (PRRs) which induce a type I interferon (IFN) response, mediated by IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2. The IFN 501 response is considered the primary host defense mechanism against viral infections. It is 502 therefore not surprising that many viruses have developed mechanisms to subvert or alter the 503 type I IFN response (61). Interference of nidoviruses with the IFN response has so far mainly 504 been investigated in the family Coronaviridae. In studies on human SARS-CoV infection the 505 presence of viral proteins in monocytes was not found to be associated with significant IFN-\u03b1 506 production and it was suggested that viral particles had been taken up by monocytes via 507 phagocytosis. This correlates with studies on IFN receptor deficient knock-out mice where MHV Python nidovirus disease. Lesions in the oral cavity and esophagus. A, B.
