There was also no significant difference in blood routine test, liver and kidney function test.

But, the crazy paving pattern on the basis of multivariable was unassociated with COVID-19 pneumonia, which may be due to other potential confounding factors. 19 But this does not mean that crazy paving pattern in COVID-19 pneumonia are unimportant. In addition, many studies have shown that the crazy paving pattern formed by interlobular septal thickening which was regarded as a typical imaging of viral pneumonia 13 .

(B) The adjustment penalty parameter was selected in the LASSO model by 10-fold cross-validation. To provide a quantitative method to estimated COVID-19 pneumonia patients probability for clinician, we developed a nomogram (the 'rms' package was used in the R software). This nomogram had a C-statistic of 0.967 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.943-0.992) for predicting the probability in suspected COVID-19 pneumonia patients (Figure 3). The radiomics nomogram was further internal validated using bootstrapping and external validated based on validation cohort. Good calibration curves were observed for the probability in suspected COVID-19 pneumonia patients in the internal validation data set and external validation cohort. The C-statistic of the radiomics nomogram were 0.848 in external validation cohort (Figure 4). Meanwhile, we developed another nomogram, based on initial viral nucleic acid detection, on the basis of univariable logistic analysis. The viral nucleic acid nomogram had a C-statistic of 0.961 (95% CI: 0.933-0.989) (Supplementary materials). Our nomogram showed higher discrimination, as compared with initial viral nucleic acid detection.The DCA showed that radiomics nomogram had a very large threshold probability range, which means this nomogram had excellent net benefit to the outcome of suspected COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Clinical impact curve of the nomogram showed the predicted probability of COVID-19 pneumonia was very close to the actual COVID-19 pneumonia (Figure 5).",
