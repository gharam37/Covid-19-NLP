Knowing the trend of the COVID-19 pandemic is critical for the federal and local governments and health care system to prepare plans. Our aim was to develop an approach and create a SAS macro to estimate the growth rate and doubling time in days if growth rate is positive or half time in days if growth rate is negative. We fit a series of growth curves using a rolling approach. This approach was applied to the hospitalization data of Colorado State during March 13 th and April 13 th . The growth rate was 0.18 (95% CI=(0.11, 0.24)) and the doubling time was 5 days (95% CI= (4, 7)) for the period of March 13 th -March 19 th ; the growth rate reached to the minimum -0.19 (95% CI= (-0.29, -0.10)) and the half time was 4 days (95% CI= (2, 6)) for the period of April 2 nd -April 8 th . This approach can be used for regional short-term prediction and monitoring the regional trend of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In the United States, the cumulative number of identified COVID-19 cases was 186,101 as of March 31st, 2020; among the identified cases, 3603 died [3] . To slow the spread of COVID-19, federal and local governments have issued mitigation measures such as case isolation, quarantine, school closures and closing non-essential businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic imposes tremendous challenges to the US health care system, particularly given concerns that the need for hospital beds and ICU beds could exceed capacity [4] [5] [6] . Predicting the future numbers of COVID-19 cases and healthcare utilization is critical for governments and health care systems preparation plans [4, 6, 7] . Two useful and critical quantities for prediction are the growth rate [8] and the doubling time of number of events [9] . The growth rate is the percent change of daily events (e.g, COVID-19 cases, number of patients hospitalized or number of deaths). The doubling time is the length of time required to double the number of daily events.",

When COVID-19 testing is widely available to the public and the number of COVID-19 testing is less selective, these models can also be used to directly estimate the growth rate and the doubling time for COVID-19 cases. Due to a lag in reporting hospitalization, it is recommended to exclude the recent 1-2 days' hospitalization data in fitting the growth curves. This paper illustrates that hospitalization data can be used to estimate the growth rate and doubling (or half) time to aid predicting future hospitalizations, deaths and COVID-19 cases. Because a series of growth curves were fit, the RGCA approach can also be used for real-time monitoring of the epidemic trend as shown in Figure 1 .",
