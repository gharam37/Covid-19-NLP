Likewise, there is a compelling need for a COVID-19 disease severity test to prioritize care and resources for patients at elevated risk of mortality. Here, an integrated point-of-care COVID-19 Severity Score and clinical decision support system is presented using biomarker measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), N-terminus pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), myoglobin (MYO), D-dimer, procalcitonin (PCT), creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). The COVID-19 Severity Score combines multiplex biomarker measurements and risk factors in a statistical learning algorithm to predict mortality. The COVID-19 Severity Score was trained and evaluated using data from 160 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from Wuhan, China. Our analysis finds that COVID-19 Severity Scores were significantly higher for the group that died versus the group that was discharged with median (interquartile range) scores of 59 (40-83) and 9 (6-17), respectively, and area under the curve of 0.94 (95% CI 0.89-0.99). These promising initial models pave the way for a point-of-care COVID-19 Severity Score system to impact patient care after further validation with externally collected clinical data. Clinical decision support tools for COVID-19 have strong potential to empower healthcare providers to save lives by prioritizing critical care in patients at high risk for adverse outcomes.",

In an analysis of 127 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, the most common complications leading to death were acute cardiac injury (58.3%), ARDS (55.6%), coagulation dysfunction (38.9%), and acute kidney injury (33.3%). 9 Biomarkers, such as cardiac troponin I (cTnI), C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and procalcitonin (PCT) were significantly increased in those that died versus those that recovered with prognostic values (as determined by area under the curve [AUC]) of 0.939, 0.870, 0.866, and 0.900, respectively. In another study, data from 82 COVID-19 deaths found that respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were present in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively, in which most patients had increased CRP (100%) and D-dimer (97.1%). 10 The importance of D-dimer as a prognostic factor was also demonstrated with odds of death significantly increased for levels greater than 1\u00b5g/mL on admission. 11 A biomarker of cardiac failure, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) has also been shown to be predictive of death in patients with community acquired pneumonia. 12 A recent study of 416 hospitalized patients with reported 82 patients (19.7%) had cardiac injury, 13 in which patients with myocardial damage had significantly higher levels of CRP, PCT, creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), cTnI, and NT-.

Patients with cardiac injury also more frequently required noninvasive mechanical ventilation (46.3% vs. 3.9%) or invasive mechanical ventilation (22.0% vs. 4 .2%) and experienced higher rates of complications such as ARDS (58.5% vs. 14.7%) compared to patients without cardiac injury. Ultimately, patients with cardiac injury had higher mortality than those without it (51.2% vs. 4.5%). Given such data, others have recommended elevating treatment priority and aggressiveness for patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and evidence of cardiac injury. 14 This growing body of clinical evidence related to COVID-19 disease severity suggests that biomarkers can play a dominant role in a scoring system to identify COVID-19 patients with increased risk of severe disease and mortality.",

As highlighted in the Introduction, one of the major diagnostic gaps and the focus of this paper is determining COVID-19 disease severity, which is the third relevant diagnostic test associated with COVID-19. Initial reports suggest that COVID-19 is associated with severe disease that requires intensive care in approximately 5% of proven infections. 8 A report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention stated that the case fatality rate was higher for those with cardiovascular disease (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), chronic respiratory disease (6.3%), hypertension (6.0%), and cancer (5.6%). Growing evidence suggests that COVID-19 interacts with the cardiovascular system on multiple levels with increased morbidity and mortality in those with underlying cardiovascular conditions. 31 Further, evidence of myocardial injury has been observed at higher rates in those that died. 31 In a study of 187 patients, 7.6% of patients (8 of 105) with normal cardiac troponin T levels and without cardiovascular disease died versus 69.4% of patients (25 of 36) with both elevated cTnT and cardiovascular disease. 14 The underlying health of the patient has a strong association with COVID-19 outcomes and must be included in clinical decision support tools for determining disease severity.",

Figure 1 highlights the key diagnostic infrastructure required to complete the integrated biomarker assays as needed to establish the COVID-19 Severity Score. From a small amount of patient sample (~100 \u03bcL serum), the cartridge and instrument perform a multistep assay sequence to 'digitize biology' by converting fluorescence immunoassay signal into biomarker concentrations. Statistical learning algorithms trained on data of biomarker studies predict a spectrum of disease. The result is a single value score which can be displayed to patients and providers in a mobile health app or directly on the instrumentation completing the test. Previously, we published a general framework for implementing a point-of-care based clinical decision support system. 17, 22 Here, we have adapted these methods to the task of predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19. It should be emphasized that while the integrated testing and COVID-19 Severity Score reporting here articulated represent what is arguably the most efficient delivery mode, the scaling and regulatory approval for this test ecosystem will take several months to complete. With the imminent arrival of the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to emphasize that the COVID-19 Severity Score can be generated immediately using biomarker measurements collected from multiple separate test platforms. We anticipate this contribution could have an immediate impact on COVID-19 patient management, and we plan to promptly distribute the COVID-19 Severity Score capabilities following additional model refinement and validation.",

Preliminary findings ( Figure S3) demonstrate that the average trajectories decrease for the \"discharged\" group increase for the \"died\" group, suggesting that the COVID-19 Severity Score could provide valuable lead time in discharging patients with low risk earlier while prioritizing care for those at elevated risk of mortality. Future efforts will be used to define various decision cuts points, reference ranges, and change scores to help guide clinical decision making including therapy decisions. Future efforts may also adapt this clinical decision support tool for ARDS resulting from other infectious viral agents such as influenza and varicella-zoster; bacteria such as Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, and Legionella; and parasites such as the malaria causing Plasmodium falciparum. 34",
