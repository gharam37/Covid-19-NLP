Its severity is best described by two parameters: its ability to spread and its lethality. Here, we combine a mathematical model with a cohort analysis approach to determine the range of case fatality rates (CFR). We use a logistical function to describe the exponential growth and subsequent flattening of COVID-19 CFR that depends on three parameters: the final CFR (L), the CFR growth rate (k), and the onset-to-death interval (t 0 ). Using the logistic model with specific parameters (L, k and t 0 ), we calculate the number of deaths each day for each cohort. We build an objective function that minimizes the root mean square error between the actual and predicted values of cumulative deaths and run multiple simulations by altering the three parameters. Using all of these values, we find out which set of parameters returns the lowest error when compared to the number of actual deaths. We were able to predict the CFR much closer to reality at all stages of the viral outbreak compared to traditional methods. This model can be used far more effectively than current models to estimate the CFR during an outbreak, allowing for better planning. The model can also help us better understand the impact of individual interventions on the CFR. With much better data collection and labeling, we should be able to improve our predictive power even further. 12 lethality.

            "text": "The Coronavirus Disease 2019, or COVID-19, is a new virus that causes respiratory 2 ailments [1] . Its origins can most likely be traced back to Wuhan, China, where it was 3 first reported in December of 2019. It is comparable to other zoonotic coronaviruses 4 such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [2] . Although most earlier cases had been confined 5 to mainland China, notably Hubei Province, a considerable number of people have been 6 infected all over the world since, and the WHO characterized the outbreak as a 7 pandemic on March 11 [1] . As of March 17, over 179,000 have been confirmed to be 8 infected, with almost 7400 deaths [3] . 9 As the Coronavirus contagion develops, with its rapid spread inciting concerns over 10 the epidemic's global impact, it is increasingly important to understand the dynamics of 11 the disease. Its severity is best described by two concepts: its ability to spread and its the average number of people to whom an infected person spreads the disease to [4] . Its 14 Case Fatality Rate (CFR) reveals the proportion of people who die from disease among 15 all individuals who contract the disease [5] . 16 Knowing the CFR is essential because it is the single most accurate metric to 17 appraise the threat posed by infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and predict its 18 prognosis. Although R0 is important to understand the rate of spread and 19 contagiousness, it does not describe the lethality of a disease. The case incidence would 20 describe the prevalence of the disease, but if it has a negligible CFR, the severity of the 21 disease is likely low. During the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea, there were only 22 186 cases, but the number of fatalities that resulted (38) was an adequate cause for 23 alarm [6] . Thus, the CFR, if calculated correctly, can help inform the appropriate 24 measures to control the epidemic.",

We can identify and compare the CFR of each cohort as well as its 47 evolution over time.

Our 49 method can help increase the accuracy of calculated CFR for both COVID-19 and 50 future viral diseases.

In an idealistic sense, we would be able to have homogenous cohorts, filtered 83 by certain conditions (age group, smoking habits, etc.) and looking at the cohorts over 84 time, we would be able to establish a pattern, and obtain a reliable CFR [ [9] , [10] ]. 85 We would need to construct these triangle charts for groups that are as homogeneous 86 as possible to ensure that certain members do not skew the death rates. Age, high-risk 87 medical groups, and countries are the right granular segments to look at. Using these, 88 we can most accurately gauge the case fatality rate for each group.

With any rapidly spreading contagion, 202 the samples chosen for determining the CFR are biased since the virus propagates so 203 quickly, affecting different people in different places. So far, the CFR is heavily skewed 204 by the numbers from Hubei Province, where the majority of cases originate.

Scanning each row from 69 left to right gives each individual cohort's most recent CFR. Scanning down each 70 column yields the CFR for each cohort for exactly the same number of days of the 71 development of the infection. This can tell us about the effects of interventions if the 72 CFR abruptly rises or drops. For example, when Wuhan, China was placed under 73 lockdown, the CFR would have decreased in the following days. Scanning diagonally 74 reveals each cohort's CFR on the same day.
