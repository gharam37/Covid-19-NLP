Substantial work has been done evaluating the efficacy of UVGI for decontamination of N95 filtering faceplate respirators (FFRs). [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Recently, UVGI has also been used to facilitate decontamination and re-use of plastic face shields. 7 Ultraviolet (UV) light is a form of electromagnetic radiation with more energy than visible light, but less energy than x-rays. It can be categorized into UV-A (315-400 nm), UV-B (280-315 nm), and UV-C (100-280 nm). The germicidal effectiveness of UV radiation is in the 180-320 nm range, with a peak at 265 nm. 8 The higher-energy UV-C rays can damage DNA and RNA via cross-linking of thymidine and uracil nucleotides, respectively, thus preventing the replication of microbes such as bacteria and viruses. 9 At these wavelengths, the amount of surface pathogen inactivation is directly proportional to the dose of UV radiation, with dosage being defined as the product of intensity (W/m 2 ) and exposure duration(s). 10, 11 Therefore, UVGI is a relatively simple method of decontamination that causes minimal damage to the respirator and avoids the use of irritating chemicals.",

Based on the UV meter data, the lowest UV-C radiation level we observed across both hoods is 64 \u00b5W cm \u22122 . Plugging these values into equation 2, we find that the minimum time required to decontaminate FFRs in a standard BSC, assuming the variance we measured above, is 4.3 hours per side. As that may be a prohibitively long time to wait, we also consider the possibility of elevating PPE within a BSC to reduce the decontamination time. Based on our measurements in Fig 2, we estimate that raising PPE 48.1 cm off the floor of a 67.3 cm tall BSC with a specified fluence of 100\u00b5W should reduce the needed decontamination time to a minimum of 62 minutes per side, given the lowest UV measurement made at that height.",

We estimate the minimum time to decontaminate face-shields is 15.6 minutes per side We invite other scientists to add measurements from their own BSCs to our github repository to allow continued updating of this recommendation. 19 Ideally, clinical sites interested in using this protocol should take measurements using calibrated UV fluence detectors of their specific BSCs prior to implementation of this protocol. If a calibrated UV detector is unavailable, UV test strips could provide an affordable way to ensure an appropriate UV dose is achieved in a given BSC. To calculate a time for an arbitrary BSC model, we recommend using Equation 2. In the future, it may be possible to design a technique that avoids the need to flip masks over and irradiate each side separately. By elevating masks off the surface of the BSC and, if necessary, placing reflective material underneath them, it should be possible to ensure that UV radiation reaches the entire mask surface simultaneously and would reduce the manual labor and time required for this protocol. 13.
