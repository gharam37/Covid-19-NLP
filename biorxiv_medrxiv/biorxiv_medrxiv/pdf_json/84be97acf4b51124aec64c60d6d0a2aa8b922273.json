(1) (2) (3) (4) This is particularly so for hospital Emergency Departments (EDs) and General Practitioners (GPs) who are seen as key providers of screening for the virus. (5) However, during the early phase of importation of SARS-CoV-2 in Australia there was limited community transmission. (6) Under this scenario, the pre-test probability of infection in individuals without epidemiological risk (such as relevant travel, or close contact with a confirmed case) is low. Unnecessary presentations for testing during this phase places additional strain on the public health service, including EDs. As we enter the pandemic phase of SARS-CoV-2, it will become critically important that the right patient is assessed, and then if necessary, treated at the right facility. This can be achieved by considering alternative strategies for screening well patients, and managing mild cases. (5) There is a paucity of literature describing the healthcare-seeking behaviours of those who present for screening for a high consequence infectious disease in Australia. As Australia moves from containment to mitigation of COVID-19, we must rapidly generate evidence to calibrate and direct policy for safe, effective and efficient models of care for COVID-19. We do not know how many mildly unwell patients elect to present to an ED for screening and the barriers and facilitators to other models of care.",

Patients were included if they were aged 16 years or older, able to complete the self-registration survey independently, or communicate to a staff member who could complete it on their behalf. Patients were excluded if they required urgent medical treatment (as assessed by triage staff) because they were re-streamed from the screening are into the resuscitation space of the ED.",

The survey was conducted in a single ED with only those who had presented to the ED (and not other healthcare providers such as GPs) so our results may not generalise to patient groups beyond our setting. Further, we excluded patients who were assessed at triage to require active medical treatment or resuscitation, which may result in an under-representation of the true number of severe cases presenting to the ED for COVID-19 screening. The survey was based on self-report and we were unable to verify patient responses (e.g. if they had tried to but been unable to get an appointment with a GP).",

Those patients who do warrant testing for SARS-CoV-2 could then be directed to an appropriate service, with well patients being directed to a community clinic or general practice and unwell patients being referred to ED with their specialised services in critical care.
