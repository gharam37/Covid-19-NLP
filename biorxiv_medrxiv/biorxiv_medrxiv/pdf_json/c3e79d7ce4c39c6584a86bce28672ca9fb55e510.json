However, given its increasingly widespread use, not only as therapy but also as prophylaxis for Covid-19, there is a great and immediate need to obtain insights into the clinical outcomes among patients currently treated with hydroxychloroquine, particularly because of the non-negligible toxicities associated with its use. 5 Therefore, we conducted a retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 in all the Veterans Health Administration medical centers across the United States to analyze the associations between hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin use and clinical outcomes. The findings of this nationwide study of one of the most complete national datasets in the United States can accelerate our understanding of the outcomes of these drugs in Covid-19 while we await the results of the ongoing prospective trials.",

To account for non-randomized assignment to the treatment groups, we utilized propensity score adjustment. For the outcomes of death and death after ventilation, we created propensity scores for hydroxychloroquine use alone and hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin use during the hospital stay. For the ventilation outcome, we created propensity scores for hydroxychloroquine use alone prior to ventilation and hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin use prior to ventilation. Both sets of propensity scores were estimated via multinomial logistic regression of treatment group. All baseline covariates were included in the propensity score models. The propensity scores were entered into the outcome models with restricted cubic splines. 16 Statistical analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute) and R software, version 3.6.1 (the R project [http://r-project.org]).

Indeed, hydroxychloroquine use in Covid-19 patients has been associated with cardiac toxicity. 4 Hydroxychloroquine has been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro with a 50% maximal effective concentration (EC50) ranging from 4.5 \u03bcM to 17 \u03bcM. 17 However, the approved dosing regimens for hydroxychloroquine in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or lupus generate substantially lower peak serum drug concentrations (~1 \u03bcM). 18, 19 Administering higher doses of hydroxychloroquine to achieve presumed antiviral concentrations might increase the risk of adverse events. Interestingly, a randomized, controlled trial of high-dose chloroquine, the parent compound of hydroxychloroquine that also has been reported to have in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 17 and similar peak serum concentrations in humans, was halted prematurely due to cardiac toxicity and higher fatality rates in the high-dose chloroquine-treated Covid-19 patients. 20 Our study has certain limitations including those inherent to all retrospective analyses such as non-randomization of treatments. We did, however adjust for a large number of Covid-19-relevant confounders including comorbidities, medications, clinical and laboratory abnormalities. Despite propensity score adjustment for a large number of relevant confounders, we cannot rule out the possibility of selection bias or residual confounding.
