There are many factors that can cause false negatives, and the specimen collection via nasopharyngeal swab could be the major challenge as the chance for the virus to move to the upper respiratory tract is smaller via non-productive cough. Degradation of the virus mRNA due to specimen inactivation at 56\u2103 is another cause for false negative result (8) .",

Mouse monoclonal anti-human IgM or IgG (purchased from Fapon Biotech) were conjugated with NSP-DMAE-NHS (purchased from Maxchemtech), and the conjugated antibodies were then purified by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column. The calibrators were made from inactivated SARS-CoV-2 human serum with designated concentrations in arbitrary unit (AU/mL). The Pre-Trigger and Trigger solutions are composed of sodium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide. All measuring procedures were performed by the fully automated immune analyzer (manufactured by Shenzhen YHLO Biotech). The correlation between the chemiluminescent signal measured as relative light unit (RLU) and the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG is shown in the dose-response curves (Figure 1).",

Following another wash cycle, Pre-Trigger and Trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as RLUs. A direct relationship exists between the amount of SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG antibodies in the sample and the RLUs detected by the optical system of the immune analyzer. The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG in the sample is determined by comparing the RLU of a sample to the RLU determined from two calibrators. If the concentration of the sample is greater than or equal to 10 AU/mL, the sample is considered reactive to SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG.PATIENT SAMPLESThe patient samples were collected from individuals recruited from 10 hospitals, 4 of which were from the worst outbreak in Hubei province, and the rest from 6 other provinces in China. The patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection were confirmed by a RT-PCR nucleic acid test, and the suspected cases were assessed following guidelines of diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, including typical epidemiological history, clinical symptoms and featured chest CT image(12). The control subjects included hospitalized patients with diseases other than COVID-19, and donors of a normal population undergoing physical examinations.

Using specimens of peripheral blood, the immunoassays solved the samplecollection challenges of nucleic acid testing. Thanks to the full automation of the immunoassays, sophisticated operational training and stringent laboratory settings are not required, as is the case for nucleic acid testing. The high throughput of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays allows for the mass screening for COVID-19. The high clinical specificity and sensitivity of the automated SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG immunoassays add great value to nucleic acid testing in fighting against COVID-19. Research Funding: B.F.
