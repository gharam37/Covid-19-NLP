We employed 10,215 ancient and modern genomes across the globe assessing 597,573 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between various ancestry proportions of European genomes and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio was calculated and its significance was statistically evaluated. We found significant positive correlation (p=0.03) between European Mesolithic hunter gatherers (WHG) ancestral fractions and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio and a marginally significant negative correlation (p=0.06) between Neolithic Iranian ancestry fractions and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio. We further identified 404 immune response related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by comparing publicly available 753 genomes from various European countries against 838 genomes from various Eastern Asian countries in a genome wide association study (GWAS). Prominently, we identified that SNPs associated with Interferon stimulated antiviral response, Interferon-stimulated gene 15 mediated antiviral mechanism and 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthase mediated antiviral response show large differences in allele frequencies between Europeans and East Asians. Overall, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the likely association between genetic ancestry and COVID-19 manifestation. While our current findings improve our overall understanding of the COVID-19, we note that the development of effective therapeutics will benefit immensely from more detailed analyses of individual genomic sequence data from COVID-19 patients of varied ancestries.",

Notably, COVID-19, caused by 2019-nCoV has shown significant worldwide variability, especially in terms of the death/recovery ratio that pertains to a ratio of the number of deaths caused by the novel coronavirus to numbers of infected individuals recovered within the same time interval. While infected individuals from some countries have recovered relatively quickly with lower morbidities, those from some other parts of the world appear to remain affected for longer with slower recovery times and demonstrate relatively higher death/recovery ratios [2] .This is suggestive of a likely population level genetic variation in terms of susceptibility to the coronavirus and COVID-19 manifestation.",

They speculated that the differences in AFs of ACE2 coding variants, likely associated with its elevated expression may influence ACE2 function and putatively impact SARS infectivity among the evaluated populations.

Model 0 was found to be highly significantly better than Model 1 (Temperature alone) and Model 2 (Humidity alone) in determining the variability of COVID-19 death/recovery ratio among the study populations, suggesting that climatic factors such as colder temperature and variation in humidityalone cannot explain the variability of COVID-19 manifestation among European countries. However, in combination with peoples' ancestral make-up, temperature disparities can explain the variation in COVID-19 death/recovery ratio.",

Interestingly, the other Iberian country, Portugal, despite reporting fewer numbers of COVID-19 cases compared to neighboring Spain, has a significantly high death to recovery ratio (3.93) underscoring the likely association between high WHG ancestry proportions in Iberians and the severity of COVID-19 infection. The WHG ancestry proportion is discernibly high among the Basque people in Spain (33.9%) and congruent with our hypothesis, the death percentage in Basque country is significantly higher compared to other Spanish provinces (https://www.statista.com/statistics/1102882/cases-of-coronavirus-confirmed-in-spain-in-2020-by-region/).

We hypothesized that this variation in COVID-19 severity may be attributed to the genetic ancestry of Central and South American populations. It has been reported that all present-day Native Americans have descended from at least four distinct ancient migration waves from Asia [20] . Two of them being ancient migrations (~15,000 years ago) from south-central Siberia (Mal'ta Upper Palaeolithic site: MA1 related) and the more recent (~5000 years ago) when Palaeo-Eskimos spread throughout the American Arctic [21] . MA1, is genetically proximal to all modern-day Native Americans (14-38% Native American ancestry) and has been found to be basal to modern-day West Eurasians, without any close affinity to East Asians [21] . MA-1 mitochondrial genome was determined to be associated with haplogroup U, which is found at high frequency among Mesolithic European hunter-gatherers (WHGs) [21] , depicting a connection between the WHG and modern-day South American genomes. In our analyses Americans could be best modelled as a combination of two source populations namely MA1 and Eskimos. We used a mixture of seven ancient and modern-day populations comprising of CHG, WHG, Sweden_HG_Motala, Papuan, Chukchi, Karitiana and Mbuti as our 'Right' outgroup populations (O7).",

It is speculated that the people of Indus-Periphery-related ancestry, while migrating northward, admixed with Steppe MLBA immigrants to form the ANI, while the others, who migrated southward and eastward admixed with AASI and formed the ASI [25] . Austroasiatic speakers originated in Southeast Asia and subsequently migrated to South Asia during the Neolithic period. The admixture between local South Asians and incoming Southeast Asians took place ~2000-3800 years ago giving rise to the AAA ancestry. Notably, the South Asian population(s) with whom the incoming Southeast Asians mingled were AASI related with little to no West Eurasian ancestry fraction [27] . Finally, it has been showed that the Tibeto-Burmans Nevertheless, the severity of COVID-19 manifestation is likely to vary appreciably across the South Asian populations. Approximately 12% people of ANI and ASI ancestries belong to mitochondrial haplogroup U, which, as described above, is found at high frequency among Mesolithic European hunter-gatherers (WHGs) [21] . Our interrogation of worldwide populations suggests that the WHG ancestral fraction is likely associated with acute COVID- .

Nevertheless we note that the current work has been performed using publicly available genomic data and a more robust understanding in this regard will emanate from sequencing/genotyping endeavours for COVID-19 patients across the spectrum of varied nationalities/ancestries and geographical locationsincluding individuals with mild to moderate symptoms, severe manifestations and death. Our results strongly advocate the adoption of a rigorous worldwide population genetics driven approach to expand and substantiate our current knowledge, as well as facilitate thedevelopment of population specific therapeutics to mitigate this worldwide challenge. .

These SNPs were associated with 161 immune system related genes including those related to innate immunity (eg.IFI27, IFIH1 and IFNG), interleukins (eg.IL16, IL17RB, IL17RD, IL1RAP, IL4R and IL6), antiviral response (eg.OAS3, SEC13, MX1, NUP54, TRIM25, NUP88, HERC5, FLNB, SEH1L, EIF4E3 and USP18) and receptors (eg.EDAR). Furthermore, six SNPs (rs2243250, rs1800872, rs1800896, rs1544410, rs1800629 and rs1805015) that display large AF variability between Europeans and East Asians are likely associated with the development of immune responses in the firstyear of life contingent upon the gene-environment interactions (https://www.snpedia.com). Finally, the SNPs with the highest Chi square values (\u22651500; P\u22480) were found to be associated with immune system related pathways such as Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-13 signaling, TNFR2 non-canonical NF-kB pathway andClass I MHC mediated antigen processing & presentation.",

The genomic proximity between East Asians and South Asians mostly from Northeast India with prominent ATB ancestry, is likely reflected through fewer numbers of COVID-19 cases from this region, so far (one case each in Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram, and two in Manipur). Notably the death to recovery ratio in the largely ATB dominated region of Ladakh, India is zero, indicating complete recovery so far of COVID-19 infected individuals from this region,while the same in its neighboring state of Jammu and Kashmir with predominant ANI ancestral fractions is discernibly higher (0.5). Further, Indian states with large number of indigenous tribal population with prevalence of AAA ancestry and/or with large fractions of AASI-related ancestry, eg. Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Orissa have not registered any COVID related deaths till date, indicating that South Asians with dominant AAA and AASI related ancestry may also likely be less severely affected against the most detrimental effects of COVID-19 infection.",

We used a mixture of eight ancient and modern-day populations comprising of Ust Ishim, MA1, Kostenki14, Han, models with different combinations of WHG ancestry fraction (x 1 ) alongside climatic factors such as 15 days' mean temperatures (x 2 ) and 15 days' mean humidity (x 3 ) of the ten European countries employed in this study to statistically evaluate their impact on COVID-19death/recovery ratio (y) using glm function implemented in R v3.6.3(Table 1).One-tailed tests were performed considering the alternative hypothesis of positive association of x 1 , x 2 The best model was determined by likelihood ratio test (LRT), employing lrtest function, implemented in R package 'epicalc'.
