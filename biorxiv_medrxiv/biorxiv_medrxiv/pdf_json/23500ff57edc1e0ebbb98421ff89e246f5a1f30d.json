We consider a region where the following conditions hold true : (a) there is no influx of cases from the outside, (b) there is extensive social distancing, though not necessarily a full lockdown, so that mass transmission events do not occur, and (c) testing capacity is high relative to the actual number of new cases per day. These conditions can make it possible for the region to initiate the endgame phase of epidemic management, wherein the virus is slowly starved of new targets through a combination of social distancing, sanitization, contact tracing and extensive testing. The dynamics of the cases in this regime is governed by a single-variable first order linear delay differential equation, whose stability criterion can be obtained explicitly. Analysis of the equation can tell us which social restrictions may be relaxed during the endgame, and which may not. For example, in an academic institution, a small research group might be allowed to meet in person once a week while classroom instruction should remain fully suspended. If the endgame can be played out for a long enough time, we claim that the disease can eventually get completely contained without affecting a significant fraction of the region's population. We present estimates of the duration for which the epidemic is expected to last, finding an interval of approximately 5-15 weeks after the endgame strategy is initiated.",

As we write this, there are more than 20,00,000 Coronavirus cases on record with 1,40,000 fatalities. The financial cost of the virus has been hardly less mind-boggling with been a simultaneous stalling of all the world's major economies and high unemployment ratios. Nevertheless, amidst the various horror stories of death and devastation, the daily news reports have started providing some glimmers of hope. Italy, which was at one time the worst affected country, has by now exhibited a manifest reduction in the daily increments of cases and deaths. Spain, where the tally was increasing by 8000 cases/day at the peak, has now slowed down to about half that rate, beyond the purview of experimental error. A similar phenomenon has occurred in Germany. A marked reduction in rate can also be seen in Iran, where the maximal value of more than 3000 cases/day has since reduced to less than 2000 cases/day. The state of New York in USA has recorded three successive days of about 7500 fresh cases after a string of four consecutive five-figure daily increments -although three swallows are not proof of summer, there is some reason to believe that the worst is over for the Big Apple. With at least some regions entering a slowing down phase, we feel it shall not be premature on our part to start wondering as to how this scourge might actually end.",

Herd immunity occurs when such a large fraction of the population is infected that the disease, so to speak, runs out of new unimmunized people to target. This is the way the influenza pandemics of 1957-8 and 1967-8 ended. In each case, about 1,00,000 people were killed in USA alone. Nevertheless, they did not give rise to either the fear or the drastic restrictions which COVID-19 has generated. This was because they were low mortality diseases with death rates of a few percent of a percent -1,00,000 Americans were killed after almost the entire nation was infected. COVID-19 however is a high-mortality disease; if it is allowed to spread unchecked upto herd immunity, then the death toll in USA alone might run to eight figures. Vaccination is a fool-proof measure in theory -in practice, it takes 12-18 months to develop a certified usable vaccine. Then there are delays involved in creating and delivering the requisite numbers of doses to inoculate the entire world. Until that time, we cannot all remain in perpetual lockdown.",

In both cases, the epidemics were contained with relatively little effort because the pathogens were quite difficult to transmit from one person to the next. The last time we'd had a highly transmissible and deadly pandemic had been the influenza of 1918-9. Unfortunately, back then, epidemiology did not exist as a scientific practice, and people did not keep very detailed records, so we have little knowledge of how that dreadful disease actually ended.",

Social media probably shows a similar profile. The scientific literature is less vehement but on the whole tends to agree. Kamikubo and Takahashi [7] and Moran et. al. [8] clearly indicate that the disease must progress upto herd immunity, while Das et. al. [9] and de Vlas and Coffeng [10] predict containment in two years (!) through intervention strategies. Mueller et. al. [11] , Donsimoni et. al. [12] and La Scala et. al. [13, 14] discuss various exit strategies from a lockdown without drawing any definite conclusion as to their effectivity or their expected time-frame. Kretzschmar et. al. [15] are clear that containment of the pandemic may be possible without resorting to herd immunity or vaccination; they do not give a time-frame. Finally, at the optimistic end of the spectrum, Zhiglavski et. al. [16] predict the end of the pandemic in England by August and Vattay [17] predicts the end of Coronavirus in Italy by May. The former work however allows the disease to spread upto herd immunity while the latter is based on a logistic equation and appears overly simplified. In what follows, we shall describe a physically plausible scenario through which it is possible for the COVID-19 pandemic to be contained in a time-frame of a few months without invoking herd immunity or vaccination.",

This automatically implies that the regional authorities have the capacity to test (and treat) far more people than there are cases.

The technical advantage of this model is that it explicitly builds in the transmission of COVID by asymptomatic persons -those who remain asymptomatic throughout the infection period as well as those who develop symptoms after the latency period. Asymptomatic transmission is the primary difference between the present pandemic and the SARS and MERS outbreaks, so it is logical to use a model which accounts for this fact. The model in Reference [18] is Equation (7). It describes community spread during the bulk phase -we shall now modify it so as to account for the endgame phase. Figure 1 of that Reference forms the basis of the model derivation -it is absolutely general so we keep it for deriving the present model, and reproduce it below. In this Figure, x is the number of healthy at-large people while y is the number of sick people who have had some exposure to society (i.e. they don't fall sick in anticipatory quarantine). We retain these definitions, as well as that of R1, the rate at which people transfer from x to y. In Ref. [18] we had taken R1 proportional to the number of healthy people and the number of sick people at large. This is an excellent assumption during a normal-life phase when every sick person (hereafter patient, even though we assume that s/he is at large only because s/he is asymptomatic) interacts with healthy people on the streets, in buses and trains, 4 in restaurants and stores etc. The more the number of healthy people, the more the crowd through which the patient passes, and the greater the number whom s/he infects.",

If there is one patient on a bus, it does not really matter if there are two, five or ten other healthy people on the same bus, so long as all of them are at least six feet away from him/her and from each other. Ideally, zero people get infected; practically there may be one or two \"unlucky\" transmission events which don't really depend on the total number of passengers inside. If the bus is sanitized after each trip, the virus can be killed off and prevented from spreading any further. A similar phenomenon occurs in a grocery store where customers stand far apart from each other -ideally there is no person-to-person transmission. A more plausible transmission chain occurs if the patient handles an item which s/he does not buy. Since the virus remains on surfaces, it can get transmitted to the person or family who later buys the contaminated item. The transmission will likely get blocked however if the second customer quickly sanitizes every item which s/he buys. If the grocer him/her-self is a patient, s/he can spread the disease to all the customers.

(The similar quantities \u03bc1 denote the fraction of asymptomatic patients relative to total patients, and \u03bc2 was relevant only in Ref. [18] but has no role here; we let 1\u2212\u03bc3 rather than \u03bc3 be the fraction of captures since that will simplify the final expressions a little.) Now, these captures will include people whom Mr X has infected right when he turned transmissible (i.e. \u03c42 days ago) and people whom he infected just prior to manifesting symptoms (i.e. right now).

Finally, the number of cases w will be more or less the same as y, with retardations to account for latency and testing delay. Since the former is quite small, and the latter is negligible by our assumption of high testing capacity, w is also not of especial significance as an independent variable. We also note that the model of Ref. [18] was expressly designed for community transmission, and in all simulations there we assumed that the epidemic somehow ended after a 100-day period. Equation (2) here describes how this might happen. To summarize and emphasize the point once more, (2) is derived from the same logic as (7) of Ref.

This is of course a wellknown criterion in terms of the reproduction number R0; what (6) does is to define it in a very precise manner in terms of social distancing measures (manifest through m0, more discussion later), latency period, asymptomatic transmission period, contact tracing activities etc. For example, if \u03bc3 = 1 i.e. there is no contact tracing and \u03bc1 = 0 i.e. there are no asymptomatic carriers either, then \u03c42m0 = 1 i.e. one patient should not transmit to more than one person during the entire latency period. The parameter \u03bc3 is a measure of how many people escape contact tracing -the greater its value, the smaller must m0 be so as to meet the criterion. Similarly, \u03bc1 is the fraction of asymptomatic carriers, who can transmit for a longer duration than the symptomatic ones -the greater this fraction, the smaller must m0 be again.

Not only will effective subdivisioning achieve better monitoring but it will also aid post-lockdown economic recovery since some regions shall achieve full containment before others. For example, Tompkins County (consisting primarily of the City of Ithaca) in New York State, where we are located, has registered 2 cases today, 3 yesterday and none at all on the preceding two days. This was possible on account of the early suspension of operations at our University, and the order to evacuate all undergraduate students ten days prior to the statewide lockdown order. A significant fraction of Tompkins' 118 cases arose from a single spreading event at a Chinese restaurant, where a waiter had the virus. This despite New York State's being one of the world's worst Coronavirus horror shows (this is the first time that the 5.5-hour distance from New York is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069443 doi: medRxiv preprint 8 City has felt like a blessing). If a region does achieve complete containment (no new cases for ~14 days), then the most logical action is to hermetically seal its borders and throw it open internally. Normal life should be restarted inside the region while rigorously preventing transport of people to and from the outside, which is still contaminated. We recognize that material supplies from the outside might be essential to the region's survival. To minimize risk, a consignment loaded into a truck outside the region should be kept inside the truck for 2-3 days, which is the estimated lifetime of the virus on surfaces [18, 22] . Only thereafter should it be delivered to the virus-free region. Inside the latter region, unloading should be done entirely by residents of that region, while the driver should remain confined inside the truck at all times. Similarly, supply trucks travelling from a virus-free region to a contaminated one should undergo a change of driver and rigorous sanitization at the border.",

Here also, the absence of testing delay enters the picture -if delay is present then the case history is a faithless reproduction of y(t), as we have discussed in Ref. [18] . But when the recorded history is a more or less accurate reproduction of y, the effective value of m0 during say the past week can be found by entering the data from the week before into (2), and simulating. The simulation results (coming below) also show that, in the stable regime, if (2) is seeded with initial straight line data, the curve remains concave throughout until reaching the equilibrium.

For this we simulate (2) in Matlab, using the same numerical integration routine employed in our previous work. We take the parameter values \u03c41 = 7, \u03c42 = 3, \u03bc1 = 1/5 and \u03bc2 = 1/2 (the first three here are taken from Ref. [18] , where includes a justification for their values). For this parameter combination, the critical value of m0 turns out to be 20/53 which is 0.3774. We seed the equation with a linear function y = 1000t (t in days) for the first 7 days (the maximum delay involved). We note that adding a constant y = 1000t +C does not change the subsequent case histories in any manner other than to add the constant C to the entire trajectory. 1000 cases/day is a realistic estimate for a postpeak hotspot region (Italy, Spain, New York State) which can consider lifting a total lockdown and initiating a controlled endgame phase. We define the epidemic to be over on the first day that there is less than one new case, and consider the endgame duration as the interval from the start of free evolution (excluding seeding) to the day that the epidemic is over. We also calculate the number of people infected during this time.",

The time trace of the epidemic in the 90 percent case is shown below. What is a realistic value of this percentage ? In Ref. [18] , it was South Korea which provided a data set for fitting, and once again it's the same country which does the honours. For after a nearly linear profile of cases in the second half of March, South Korea is now clearly showing a downward-bending case trajectory indicative of an endgame phase. From 28 March to 04 April, the cases increased almost linearly from 9478 to 10156. The cases on the next few days until yesterday, as per Reference [23], are given in Table 1 Using the parameter values mentioned before (for which the critical m0 = 20/53), we seed (2) with an exactly linear growth from 9478 to 10156 for 7 days and then pick the m0 which results in the best fit to the data of Table 1 . We find that m0 equals 75 percent of the critical. The overlap upto the 7 th day in the plot is insignificant since that is in the seeding period -the subsequent excellent match however is noteworthy.

A sample region can also be one where a definite peak has been avoided through early lockdown and then the endgame is being initiated with an increase in the testing capacity. The state of Kerala in India is likely in this regime and we hope that Nayi Dilli and Mumbai may also enter this category within the next couple of weeks. \u00a73 CONCLUSION In this Article, we have demonstrated a way in which continuous social distancing combined with extensive testing and contact tracing over a period of weeks can result in complete containment of the Coronavirus pandemic at a regional level without resorting to herd immunity and in a time frame significantly smaller than what the development of a vaccine would undertake. Multiple such regions can eventually make up a country, and finally the whole world. While restrictions on social mobility are likely to remain in place for a while, yet with some luck we are probably not looking at house arrest all the way upto 2022. The greater the restraint we practise now, the faster are we going to have this evil virus behind us. Our analysis also identifies the kinds of relaxation which can be permitted during the endgame phase, and the kinds which definitely cannot.",

There is some evidence [22, 26] to indicate that the transmissibility of the virus is reduced in summer. The initial outbreak in Australia and New Zealand, which were in summer when the virus first arrived, has remained quite muted. In India and Singapore also, the trajectory so far has been flatter than in similar places located in colder climates. Reduced transmissibility means that for the same social restrictions, m0 will be lower. For example, an infringement of separation minima on a bus might result in transmission with 80 percent probability in cold weather and 50 percent probability in hot weather. As we saw, even a small reduction in m0 can result in a drastic shortening of the time to the end of the outbreak. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04. 17.20069443 doi: medRxiv preprint Although we would not like to spawn false hope, we do think that there is a reasonable chance that COVID-19 might really get contained within the end of summer. Of course, this will be contingent on the authorities' doing a continuously competent job of epidemic management and everyone's abiding by the restrictions that are laid down. Mistakes during the endgame, over-hasty opening of borders and similar actions can result in a virulent second wave being released and the good work of several past months being undone.
