The correlations between pathogen susceptibility and blood type distribution have attracted attention decades ago. The current retrospective study aimed to examine the correlation between blood type distribution and SARS-CoV-2 infection, progression, and prognosis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With 265 patients from multiple medical centers and two established cohorts, we found that the blood type A population was more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the blood type distribution was not relevant to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), and mortality in COVID-19 patients. These findings are indicative of coping with the great threat since it probed the relationship between blood types and ARDS, AKI, and mortality, in addition to susceptibility in COVID-19 patients.",

Previous studies showed that blood type A was associated with a higher risk of developing ARDS and AKI in the ICU among individuals of European descent, but not in those with African descent [34, 35] . This means that racial divergence and environmental factors may alter the ABO-ARDS or ABO-AKI associations. It is plausible to hypothesize that the existing conclusion drawn in European descent with trauma or severe sepsis may not be applied to the Asian population with COVID-19.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become the third coronavirus that causes large-scale infections among humans, following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in the past two decades. The coronavirus outbreak has caused 81,008 infections in China by March 20, 2020 and spread to 171 other countries. More than 1,000,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, among which more than 50,000 people died. The severe outbreak of COVID-19 made it a public health threat all over the world. All nations are allocating numerous medical and scientific resources to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Scientists have been investigating the pathology, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19. It is meaningful to perform relevant research on the susceptibility and outcome of COVID-19.

Identification of critically ill patients was achieved by reviewing and analyzing the admission logs and histories from all available electronic medical records. AKI was diagnosed if the serum creatinine levels change within 2 days based on the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria [22]. Patients were diagnosed with ARDS based on the 2012 Berlin definition [23]. Laboratory testing and data collection ABO blood type of patients was determined by standard RBC typing performed for clinical purposes.
