Here, we performed proteomic and metabolomic profiling of sera 27 from 46 COVID-19 and 53 control individuals. We then trained a machine 28 learning model using proteomic and metabolomic measurements from a 29 training cohort of 18 non-severe and 13 severe patients. The model correctly 30 classified severe patients with an accuracy of 93.5%, and was further 31 validated using ten independent patients, seven of which were correctly 32 classified. We identified molecular changes in the sera of COVID-19 patients 33 implicating dysregulation of macrophage, platelet degranulation and 34 complement system pathways, and massive metabolic suppression. This 35 study shows that it is possible to predict progression to severe COVID-19 36 disease using serum protein and metabolite biomarkers. Our data also 37 uncovered molecular pathophysiology of COVID-19 with potential for 38 developing anti-viral therapies.",

Correspondingly, 82 metabolites were involved 143 in the three biological processes. We summarize the key dysregulated 144 molecules in Figure 5 and discussed in the following sections. 145 146 Dysregulated macrophage and lipid metabolism 147 Our data uncovered dysregulation of multiple apolipoproteins including 148 APOA1, APOA2, APOH, APOL1, APOD and APOM (Figure 3A). Most of them 149 are associated with macrophage function and were down-regulated. Decrease 150 of APOA1 in serum has been reported during the transition of COVID-19 151 patients from mild to severe illness (Nie et al., 2020). The APOM in serum of 152 severe patients was downregulated compared with healthy and non-severe 153 COVID-19 patients. Regulation of serum APOM has also been observed in 154 hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients (Gu et al., 2011). 155 Consistent with these proteomic findings, we also detected dysregulated 156 metabolites involved in lipid metabolism. Accumulation of 16 steroid hormones biomembranes, which mediate signal transduction and immune activation 175 processes. Sphingolipids, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate, can induce 176 macrophage activation, inhibit macrophage apoptosis, and promote migration 177 of macrophages to inflammatory sites (Weigert et al., 2009). Phagocytosis 178 and platelet degranulation are coupled with changes in biomembrane lipid 179 composition and fluidity, and modulate the production of glycerophospholipids 180 (Rouzer et al., 2007). In this study, we found continuous decrease of 181 glycerophospholipids after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Glycerophospholipids and 182 fatty acids such as arachidonic acid have been found significantly elevated in 183 HCoV-229E-infected cells, and exogenous supplement of arachidonic acid 184 significantly suppressed HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV replication (Yan et al., 185 2019).

This was 190 probably due to activated macrophage-mediated immunity (Sanchez-Lopez et 191 al., 2019).

In response to elevated cytokines, especially IL-6 which 313 triggers fever, the liver releases various APPs. Activation of APPs is 314 accompanied with the immunogenesis or organic damage (Gabay and 315 Kushner, 1999). Our metabolomics data also provide plausible evidence for 316 hepatic injury. In physiological condition, hormone or bilirubin binds to 317 glucuronate, a derivative of glucose, for liver detoxification (Rowland et al., 318 2013). The elevation of glucose, glucuronate, bilirubin degradation product 319 and four bile acid derivatives in severe patients, indicating the potential 320 declined detoxification function (Figures 4-5). Indeed, our data showed an 321 upregulation of multiple APPs, including CRP and major attack complexes 322 (MACs) in the severe sera. CRP can activate the complement system (Chirco 323 and Potempa, 2018).

Positive was concluded if RdRp gene was 643 positive (Ct < 43), and one of E or N was positive (Ct <43). Patients were also 644 diagnosed as positive if two sequential tests of RdRp were positive while E 645 and N were negative. According to the abovementioned guideline, COVID-19 646 patients are classified into four subgroups: 1) Mild: mild symptoms without 647 pneumonia; 2) Typical: fever or respiratory tract symptoms with pneumonia; 3) 648 Severe: fulfill any of the three criteria: respiratory distress, respiratory rate \u2265 649 30 times/min; means oxygen saturation \u2264 93% in resting state; arterial blood 650 oxygen partial pressure/oxygen concentration \u2264 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 651 kPa); 4) Critical: fulfill any of the three criteria: respiratory failure and require 652 mechanical ventilation; shock incidence; admission to ICU with other organ 653 failure. In this study, we included both severe and no-severe patients, with the 654 latter composed of mild and typical COVID-19 patients. Last follow-up of 655 these patients was March 10, 2020.
