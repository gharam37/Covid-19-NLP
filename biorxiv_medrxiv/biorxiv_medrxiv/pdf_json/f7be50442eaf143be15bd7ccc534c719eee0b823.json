However, a small proportion of older people 319 (~15%) show good cutaneous VZV responsiveness (score 3-10), a group we designated as 320 'old responders'. To assess whether the CD14 + monocyte infiltration was a characteristic of 321 all aged individuals or only those with reduced VZV-specific immunity, we investigated the 322 infiltration of these cells after saline in old VZV responders (red circles) and low responders 323 (filled circles). Old responders to VZV exhibited a similar low extent of CD14 + monocyte 324 infiltration to younger adults (black squares). However, the majority of older donors with a 325 low clinical score (filled circles) had elevated infiltration of these cells. When all the data was 326 combined there was a significant negative correlation between the fold change in CD14 + 327 monocytes in response to saline challenge and the VZV clinical score (R=-0.38 and p=0.04; 328 Figure 1E ). Collectively this indicates that the early recruitment of monocytes to the site of 329 skin challenge in old people was associated with decreased antigen-specific immunity. 330 331 Senescent stromal cells contribute to recruitment of monocytes in the old. 332",

In normal 412 skin, CD14 + monocytes were on average 15.86\u03bcm away from CD4 + TRM, however after 413 saline injection the monocytes were significantly closer to the CD4 + TRM (9.47\u03bcm; Figure 4B  414 and C). This increased proximity was likely due to increase in the number of monocytes in 415 the skin after saline injection.

This was to mitigate 294 against inter-personal variation in the magnitude of responses observed (Supplementary 295 Figure 2A). CD14 is expressed by the majority of peripheral blood monocytes (classical and 296 intermediate). There was a significant increase in CD14 + cells in saline injected skin at 6 297 hours post-injection (Figure 1B and 1C). We next investigated the expression of CCR2, a 298 chemokine receptor for CCL2, which is highly expressed by CD14 + monocytes (Patel et al., 299 2017; Ziegler-Heitbrock et al., 2010). There was a significant increase in number of 300 CD14 + CCR2 + cells in saline injected skin as compared to normal skin in old but not young 301 subjects (Figure 1C).

            "text": "and F). It is known that fibroblasts can 353 produce CCL2 (Pereira et al., 2019). We and others have shown that there are increased 354 numbers of senescent fibroblasts in the skin of older humans (Dimri et al., 1995; Pereira et 355 al., 2019; Ressler et al., 2006) and CCL2 is a known component of the senescence 356 associated secretory phenotype (SASP) (Campisi, 2013). Indeed, using p16 as a marker of 357 senescence we found that FSP1 + p16 + fibroblasts were the main source of CCL2 after saline 358 injection of old donors (Figure 2G and H). Senescent fibroblasts made up 61.8% of 359 CCL2 + FSP1 + cells in normal skin which increased to 70.7% in saline-injected skin (data not 360 shown). Although some non-senescent fibroblast evidently expressed CCL2, our previous 361 data showed that senescent fibroblasts produce significantly more CCL2 than the non-362 senescent fibroblasts (Pereira et al., 2019). Therefore, the early production of SASP-related 363 mediators by senescent fibroblasts after saline injection (including CCL2) may lead to the 364 recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the site of skin challenge. This interaction between 365 senescent cells and monocyte recruitment is supported indirectly by the significant 366 correlation between the number of senescent fibroblasts present in the skin and the extent of 367 CD14 + monocyte infiltration after saline injection (Fig. 2I). 368 369 Monocytes inhibit TRM proliferation through production of Prostaglandin E2. 370 We next investigated the mechanisms by which the recruitment of monocytes reduced 371 antigen-specific immunity in old subjects. We first assessed the expression of inhibitory 372 pathways in normal and saline injected skin pre-and post-Losmapimod by RNAseq. We 373 found that saline injection (in old individuals) resulted in increased expression of a number of 374 immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT) receptors such as LILRB3 (ILT5), LILRB2 (ILT4), 375 LILRA2 (ILT1), LILRB4 (ILT3) and LILRB1 (ILT2), inhibitory ligands such as CD274 376 (programme-death ligand 1; PDL-1) and PDCD1LG2 (PDL-2), ligand for the T cell receptor 377 TIGIT and PVR, as well as inducible COX2 enzyme PTGS2 (Figure 3A). 378 PTGS2 (encoding COX2) was one of the most highly upregulated genes in saline-injected 379 skin of the old subjects (Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2018) and elevated COX2 expression 380following saline injection was confirmed at the protein level by immunohistology (Figure 3B",

LPS treatment significantly increased COX2 387 expression in monocytes compared to untreated controls (Supplementary Figure 3) (Dean et 388 al., 1999; Mestre et al., 2001). Unstimulated and LPS-stimulated monocytes were co-389 cultured with autologous peripheral CD4 + T cells in the presence of anti-CD3 and IL-2 and 390 proliferation was assessed at after four days. Stimulated monocytes inhibited CD4 + T cell 391 proliferation as compared to control (unstimulated) monocytes (Figure 3E-F). However, 392 production of the cytokines IFNy, IL-2 and IL-10 was not affected at day 4 post-culture (data 393 not shown). To determine if COX2 expression was involved in the inhibition of CD4 + T cell 394 proliferation, a COX2-specific inhibitor NS-398 was added to the co-cultures. Treatment with 395 NS-398 led to a significant increase in the proliferation of the CD4 + T cells (Figure 3G). 396 COX2 is involved in the production of a range of lipid mediators, the most common being 397 PGE2 (Kalinski, 2012). To establish if PGE2 was involved in the inhibition of CD4 + T cell 398 proliferation, we blocked the receptor for PGE2, EP4, on CD4 + T cells using the inhibitor MF-399 498. The blockade of PGE2 signalling significantly increased the proliferation of the CD4 + T 400 cells in the presence of inflammatory monocytes (Figure 3H). To confirm that PGE2 did not 401 alter the monocyte phenotype we cultured monocytes with PGE2 and assessed their 402 inhibitory receptor (CD112, CD155, Galectin 9, ILT3 and PDL-1, PDL-2) expression and 403 cytokine production. We did not observe any significant effects on the expression of these 404 receptor expression in monocytes (data not shown), confirming the effect of PGE2 was on 405 the CD4 + T cells directly.

To investigate if p38-MAPK inhibition altered CCL2 429 production and inflammatory monocyte recruitment in the skin, RNAseq analysis was 430 performed on biopsies collected from normal skin and from skin 6 hours after saline injection 431 with saline both before and after Losmapimod treatment (study design Figure 5A).

This 439 response to saline was reduced after Losmapimod pre-treatment (Figure 5C) and the top six 440 upregulated genes that were significantly different between normal and saline injected skin 441 were no longer significantly different post-Losmapimod treatment (Supplementary Figure 442 4A).

In line 467 with these observations, the increase in CD14 + COX2 + cells after saline injection was also 468 inhibited after post-Losmapimod treatment in vivo (Figure 6E). These data collectively 469 suggest that in vivo Losmapimod can restore CD4 + T cell responses in part through the 470 inhibition of COX2 expression. 471 472 p38 MAP kinase inhibition significantly increases T cell infiltration into the site of VZV 473 challenge. 474 We assessed the clinical score of 42 old subjects after VZV antigen challenge in the skin 475 both before and after Losmapimod treatment. We confirmed and extended our previous 476 observations that treatment with Losmapimod significantly increased VZV clinical score 477 (n=42; Figure 7A). No difference was observed between male and female donors in their 478 response to Losmapimod treatment (Supplementary Figure 1B). Losmapimod treatment also 479 significantly decreased serum CRP in all individuals, irrespective of whether or not they 480 increased their skin response to VZV challenge (Figure 7B). 481 We showed previously that there is a significant association between the clinical score after 482 VZV antigen challenge and the accumulation of T cells at the site of injection (Agius et al., 483 2009; Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2018). We found that Losmapimod pre-treatment was 484 associated with a significant increase in CD4 + (Figure 7C,7D) and CD8 + (Figure 7F, 7G) T 485 cell infiltration into the skin 7 days after VZV injection.

            "text": "tissue injury induced by saline injection had the lowest response to recall response 495 to VZV antigen challenge in the skin (Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2018). This suggested that 496 increased propensity to exhibit inflammatory responses leads to inhibition of VZV-specific T 497 cell responses in the skin. The fact that the temporary blockade of inflammation in these old 498 individuals with a p38-MAPK inhibitor in vivo enhanced the response to VZV antigen 499 challenge in the skin supports this contention (Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2018). However, the 500 source of inflammation in the skin of older subjects or the mechanism by which the 501 inflammation inhibited TRM cell function was not known. 502 We now show that senescent fibroblasts in the skin of old subjects secrete an array of 503 chemokines including CCL2 in response to tissue injury, such as those induced by injecting 504 saline, VZV or air. This leads to recruitment of inflammatory monocytes into the skin that 505 inhibit skin TRM activation in part by secreting lipid mediators such as PGE2 via a COX2-506 dependant pathway. However, short-term systemic p38-MAPK blockade induced by treating 507 old donors with Losmapimod, leads to significantly reduced CCL2 (and other chemokine) 508 production by senescent fibroblasts, reduced monocyte infiltration and reduced COX2 and 509 PGE2 expression in response to injection of saline or VZV antigens. This results in 510 significant improvement of VZV-specific cutaneous T cell responses (Figure 8). Therefore, 511 p38-MAPK inhibition can act by significantly reducing the recruitment of inflammatory 512 monocytes into the skin and also by inhibiting the function of those that still manage to 513 extravagate into the tissue. 514 Ageing leads to the accumulation of senescent cells that is observed in many tissues 515 including the skin (Pereira et al., 2019; Ressler et al., 2006); therefore, the recruitment of 516 inflammatory monocytes in response to signals from senescent fibroblasts may contribute to 517 age-related decreased immunity in other organs as well as the skin. CCL2 is involved in the 518 recruitment of monocytes into the skin and it is a component of the SASP (Pereira et al., 519 2019). The significant correlation between the number of senescent fibroblasts that were 520 present in the skin before injection and the extent of CD14 + monocyte infiltration indirectly 521 supports the interaction between these cells. Although the abundance of senescent cells 522 increases in the skin during ageing (Dimri et al., 1995; Pereira et al., 2019; Ressler et al., 523 2006) there is no overt expression of inflammatory mediators in un-manipulated skin of old 524 subjects (Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2015). This suggests that at the steady state, the 525 propensity to mount inflammatory responses including the SASP is inhibited in this tissue. inflammatory mediators by senescent tissue stromal cells and this requires 531 further investigation. The breakdown of homeostasis induced by tissue injury, may override 532 pre-existing inhibitory processes and allow the secretion of SASP-related factors leading to 533 the subsequent events that we have described 534 We found that skin infiltrating monocytes secrete PGE2 via a COX2 dependent pathway. 535 PGE2 has disparate roles in immune responses as it has been shown to be pro-536 inflammatory (causing oedema formation and pain) as well as contributing to resolution of 537 inflammation (Kalinski, 2012). Here we show that PGE2 produced by COX2 expressing 538 inflammatory monocytes inhibits T cell proliferation in vitro and may directly inhibit antigen-539 specific TRM activation in the skin. PGE2 has been shown previously to directly inhibit CD4 + T 540 cell proliferation in humans (Okano et al., 2006). Furthermore, this inhibition may occur via 541 increased expression of COX2 and production of PGE2 by monocytes (Chen et al., 2011). 542 During chronic viral infection PGE2 can also directly suppress CD8 + T cells delaying viral 543 clearance (Chen et al., 2013). We now show that PGE2 can directly suppress the activation 544 and proliferation of human skin derived TRM cells. PGE2 may also induce the expansion and 545 increase the function of Foxp3 + Tregs (Baratelli et al., 2005; Sharma et al., 2005) explaining 546 why these cells increases in the skin during ageing (Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2008; 547 Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2013). 548 Elevated PGE2 concentrations are also found at the sites of chronic viral infection and virus-549 specific T cells in the liver of Hepatitis B infected individuals express the PGE2 receptor EP4 550 (Chen et al., 2015; Okano et al., 2006). The observation that PGE2 is found in tumour sites 551 prompted the suggestion that COX2 inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of colon cancer 552 and basal and squamous cell carcinoma (Pandeya et al., 2019; Steinbach et al., 2000). In 553 addition, PGE2 may promote immunosuppression by inducing the anti-inflammatory cytokine 554 IL-10 by mononuclear phagocytes (MacKenzie et al., 2013; Nakanishi and Rosenberg, 555 2013). We now show that the PGE2 receptor, EP4, is expressed by the majority of skin-556 resident TRM that facilitates the inhibition of these cells by this mediator. 557 Monocytes were historically regarded as precursors of macrophages, however more recent 558 data shows that they can be effector cells in their own right (Cros et al., 2010; Goritzka et al., 559 2015). We confirmed previous studies showing that monocytes can inhibit antigen-specific 560 responses (Sammicheli et al., 2016; Watanabe et al., 2017).

            "text": "568 Relevant to our current observations, it has been shown that senescent cells increase in the 569 lungs with age-dependent pathology (Barnes et al., 2019) and it will be important to 570 understand if these cells are involved with the recruitment of these inflammatory monocytes 571 in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Although CCR2 + monocytes can contribute to the 572 inflammatory environment in the skin, they are also actively involved in the resolution of 573 inflammation, for example in in the gut (Farro et al., 2017). Therefore, microenvironmental 574 cues may determine the function of monocytes that are recruited into different tissues. 575 Excessive inflammation has been shown to inhibit antigen-specific immunity (Pence et al., 576 2012) and reduce vaccination efficacy (Fourati et al., 2016; Muyanja et al., 2014; Parmigiani 577 et al., 2013). We have shown that the effects of inflammation on inhibiting immunity can be 578 reversed with a p38-MAPK inhibitor. Studies with other inhibitors of inflammation such as 579 mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin have shown that they can enhance the response to influenza 580 vaccination in older subjects by 20% (Mannick et al., 2014). Additionally, in non-human 581 ageing models, metformin and rapamycin can increase life-span and immune function 582 (Cabreiro et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2011; Neff et al., 2013). In addition, in a murine model of 583 breast cancer COX2 inhibitor could improve DC-based vaccine efficacy by increasing IFN\u03b3 584 production and cytotoxic CD8 function (Basu et al., 2006). Therefore, many anti-585 inflammatory drugs are already licenced for use in humans or have been through phase III 586 clinical trials. Our observations with the p38-MAPK inhibitor Losmapimod provide a proof-of-587 principle demonstration that the efficacy of these drugs could be tested for their ability to 588 prevent the deleterious effects of inflammageing resulting in the enhancement of antigen-589 specific immunity in older humans in vivo. seq samples.

Samples were separated by protein 243 electrophoresis at 120 V for 2 h using 10% Bis-Tris pre-cast gels (NuPage) and transferred 244 overnight at 4\u00b0C onto Hybond-P PVDF membranes (GE Healthcare). After blocking in ECL 245 blocking agent (GE Healthcare), membranes were probed with primary antibodies overnight 246 at 4\u00b0C. Primary antibodies used were COX2 (ab15191; Abcam), phospho-p38 MAPK 247 (T180/Y182; 9211), and p38 MAP Kinase (9212), GAPDH (2118; Cell Signalling). The 248 membrane was washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE 249Healthcare, 1:4000) for 1 h at room temperature. Antibodies were detected using the ECL 250 detection kit (GE Healthcare). Prior to re-probing with different antibodies, membranes were 251 stripped at room temperature with agitation using Restore stripping buffer (Thermo 252 Scientific). Protein bands were quantified using ImageJ software. The integrated density of 253 each band was normalised to GAPDH using the gel analysis function of ImageJ. 254Dermal Fibroblast isolation and culture: 256Dermal fibroblasts were isolated and cultured as described previously(Pereira et al., 2019). 257 senescence was induced in primary human dermal fibroblasts by exposure to X-ray radiation 258 at a total dose of 10Gy at a rate of 5Gy/min. Irradiated cells were cultured for a further 10-28 259 days to allow for senescence to develop. Senescence was confirmed by staining for SA\u03b2-260 galactosidase (Cell signalling, London U.K.).
