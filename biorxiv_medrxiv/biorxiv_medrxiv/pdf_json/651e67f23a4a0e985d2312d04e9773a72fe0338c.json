Here we propose exit strategies from lockdown that provide sustainable, albeit reduced, economic activity. We use mathematical models to show that a cyclic schedule of 4-day work and 10-day lockdown, or similar variants, can, in certain conditions, suppress the epidemic while providing part-time employment. The cycle reduces the reproduction number R by a combination of reduced exposure time and an anti-phasing effect in which those infected during work days reach peak infectiousness during lockdown days. The number of work days can be adapted in response to observations. Throughout, full epidemiological measures need to continue including hygiene, physical distancing, compartmentalization and extensive testing and contact tracing. We do not call for immediate adoption of this policy, but rather to consider it as a conceptual framework, which, when combined with other interventions to control the epidemic, can offer the beginnings of predictability to many economic sectors.",

Once a lockdown has reduced the number of critical cases to a desired goal, a decision must be reached on how to exit it responsibly. The main concern is the risk of resurgence of the epidemic. One strategy proposes reinstating lockdown when a threshold number of critical cases is exceeded in a resurgence, and stopping lockdown again once cases drop below a low threshold ( 2 , 5 ) (Fig 1A,S1 ). While such an \"adaptive triggering\" strategy can prevent healthcare services from becoming overloaded, it leads to economic uncertainty and continues to accumulate cases with each resurgence.",

Simulation used a SEIR-Erlang deterministic model with mean latent period of 3 days and infectious periods of 4 days. Results are robust to uncertainty in model parameters (Fig S2) . An important consideration is that the cyclic strategy is adaptive, and can be tuned when conditions change and the effects of the approach are monitored. For example, weather conditions may affect R ( 5 ) , as well as advances in regional monitoring and case tracing. If one detects, for example, that a 4:10 strategy leads to an increasing trend in cases, one can shift to a cycle with fewer work days. Conversely, if a strong decreasing trend is observed, one can shift to more work days and gain economic benefit (Fig 5) . A conservative approach can exit lockdown with 1 day of work, build up to two days, and so on. Measures will be required during the work days to ensure that people do not excessively compensate for the lockdown periods by having so many more social connections that R is significantly increased. This may include sound epidemiological measures such as the continuation of banning large social events and clear communication campaigns by the health authorities to enhance adherence to hygiene and physical distancing. Shared work spaces can be disinfected to reduce future infection through surfaces. Extensive rapid testing and contact tracing should be developed and extended in parallel ( 12 ) .",

First, long-term unemployment (6 months or more) leads to human capital depreciation that in turn reduces productivity, employability and wages ( 13 -16 ) . Although lock-downs are not predicted to last a full six months, it is likely that many businesses will not re-open immediately following lockdown termination, would rehire in smaller numbers, or fail to reopen at all. Hence, many workers would face long-term unemployment even if the actual lockdown is significantly shorter. In instances of widespread unemployment, individual workers decline in productivity and could have an aggregate long-term depressing effect on productivity growth in the entire economy ( 17 ) . Long-term unemployment also exerts negative effects on social capital: in this context, the deterioration of social networks that help the unemployed to find appropriate employment opportunities ( 25 ) .

Even if governments loosen restrictions on congregation, most people would refrain from patronizing large-scale entertainment events, for example, as long as a substantial perceived Covid-19 health risk is present. Under such circumstances, such businesses may prefer full lockdown anticipating that the 'all clear' signal would arrive earlier than under the cyclic scheme. Unfortunately, full lockdown cannot guarantee that resurgence would not occur.

In some cases, shifting from continuous processing to semi-continuous operations would require reorganization of work. In others, cessation of activities comes at high cost due, for example, to undesirable chemical reactions that occur when material flow stops.
