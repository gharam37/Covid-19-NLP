However, different regions have experienced the spread of this disease differently. Here, we develop a Markovian random-walk spatial extension of a quarantine-enhanced SIR model to measure, visualize and forecast the effect of susceptible population density, testing rate, and social distancing and quarantine policies on epidemic spreading. The model is used to simulate the spread of CoVID-19 in the regions of Hubei, China; South Korea; Iran; and Spain. The model allows for evaluating the results of different policies both quantitatively and visually as means of better understanding and controlling the spread of the disease.",

This work seeks to understand why different countries experience this peak at different magnitudes and different speeds. Given the contemporary nature of this pandemic, in addition to the aim of purely modeling the epidemic spread of CoVID-19, this work seeks to graphically visualize this spread for the benefit of all concurrent research continuing on this topic.

In this system, the coefficient \u03b2 represents the rate of transmission of the disease from the infected to the susceptible population, and \u03b3 represents the rate of removal, corresponding to recovery or death.

Variations of the SIR model include the SEIR model where a new state E (exposed) is introduced, or SIS, where recovered agents are susceptible to reinfection. While these models have been shown to act as accurate approximations for the spread of notable infectious diseases [9] , the pandemic nature of CoVID-19 has resulted in policy-driven responses from communities to actively curb spread of the disease, namely quarantining large numbers of individuals testing positive for the virus [10] . This work accounts for this population by extending the model to add a Quarantined state Q that captures the effect of isolating agents who test positive for the virus. By applying the SIR-Q states to a spatio-temporal random walk model, the spread of CoVID-19 can be visualized and the effect of critical demographic and policy variables upon epidemic spreading are evaluated.",

Hubei province (China) and South Korea both have experienced a decline in active confirmed cases, while the rate of new active confirmed cases in Spain appears to be decreasing. Cases in Iran continue to increase. Active confirmed cases are calculated by subtracting recovered and dead counts from the number of total confirmed cases. Active confirmed cases are analogous to the combined populations of Infected and Quarantined agents in the model. The simulations are scaled with a linear population scaling factor, and the population density index D and testing rate T are manually fitted from the rate of active confirmed and removed cases in the real data. The results of these simulations are shown in figures 5 and 6. The parameters used in the simulations are included in table 1.",

By recurrent testing of the population, infected individuals can be identified and quarantined, effectively preventing them from spreading the disease any further. It was observed that through increased rates of testing, an increasing percentage of the population could be saved from experiencing CoVID-19 altogether, to a point where if 40% of the population could be tested daily, any disease having a similar reproduction number would not be able to spread at all. This suggests an opportunity for preventing future viral outbreaks if testing can become a routine procedure that responsible members of the population carry out on themselves and self-report. It was also observed that through increased rates of testing, the peak of confirmed cases could be lowered, relieving the toll of an epidemic on the supply chain, and indirectly human wellbeing.",
