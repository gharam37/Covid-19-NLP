Few if any epidemiological indicators distinguish the countries of Europe by such a vast margin. Evidence on age-specific casefatality rates (deaths over observed infections) and age-specific death rates (deaths over population) indicate that COVID-19 disproportionately afflicts the elderly and frail, suggesting that the share of elderly population (\u2265 65 years of age) in a country ought to be a strong predictor of the COVID-19 death rate. However, the COVID-19 death rate and the share of elderly population are statistically uncorrelated (r = 0.163, p = 0.399). Share of population \u2265 65 years of age is confounded by mortality selection, as well as other demographic dynamics. By contrast, elderly longevity or life expectancy at 65 more effectively captures population survival and the accumulation of age-related frailty in society. We find a strong statistical relationship between the COVID-19 death rate (r = 0.839, p < .001) and elderly longevity, and a moderately strong relationship between the date of epidemic timing and elderly longevity (r = \u22120.634, p < .001). These relationships are robust to the inclusion of statistical controls for international tourism inflow and hospital bed capacity. While the countries of Europe vary meaningfully in healthcare system capacity and in the timing and intensity of non-pharmaceutical interventions, the striking variation in COVID-19 death rates across these countries is statistically and intuitively associated with elderly survival and consequent frailty. NOTE: Predicted values in Panel A leverage equation (1) with all other model covariates fixed at their sample means. Predicted values in Panel B leverage equation (2), again with all other model covariates fixed at their sample means.",

Taking the natural log of both variables still results in statistical independence (r = 0.104, p = 0.591).

Only at the share of population \u2265 85 years of age does the relationship to the COVID-19 death rate become moderately correlated and significant (r = 0.541, p = 0.003).

            "text": "COVID-19 disproportionately afflicts the elderly, especially the elderly with underlying health conditions. Frailty is a term used to capture a range of age-related conditions that impair the elderly. Frail populations are prone to dependency, and less likely to withstand a health shock (Hoogendijk et al, 2019; Theou et al 2018 , Vetrano et al, 2018 Denfeld et al, 2017) . The share of population \u2265 65 years of age is an imperfect proxy for elderly survival and consequent frailty because it is confounded by other components of population size and mortality selection. Among many other examples, the numerator in the share of population \u2265 65 partly reflects elderly survival but may also reflect the parental fertility of the present elderly relative to the fertility of subsequent cohorts. With respect to mortality selection, frail populations are less resistant to health shocks, decreasing their survival probability. At a population level, this results in a relative increase of death resistant or health robust individuals with age (Vogt and Missov 2017; Vaupel et al, 1979) . Consider two similarly economically developed countries with varying survival to age of 75, the standard threshold for premature death. Suppose that one country has high and the other low risk of premature death from all causes. Other things held equal, persons surviving to 75 in the high-risk all-cause mortality country are more positively selected on the underlying ability to death resist than counterparts in the low-risk all-cause mortality country. Given mortality selection, elderly persons over the age of 75 in the high-risk country are more likely to withstand adverse health shocks than similarly aged persons in the low-risk country because they are different on the unobserved trait of underlying frailty.",

As shown in Appendix Figure Life expectancy at 65 is not only strongly correlated with the COVID-19 death rate, but also moderately correlated with epidemic timing.

This renders a sizeable segment of the population at-risk to an adverse health event like a lethal respiratory assault. Our index of elderly frailty, emphasizing the proneness of elderly to dependency is positively correlated with life expectancy at 65. In France, Spain and Italy, the three hardest hit countries of Europe, about half to two-thirds of elderly require assistance for basic personal and household care activities. This fact educates that a sizeable percentage of European elderly cannot easily socially distance. They require the intimacy of care, and intimate care or interpersonal proximity is a transmission risk. More proximate, our results imply that the order-of-magnitude higher COVID-19 mortality risk in Italy and Spain may result from patterns of interpersonal contact required to support an increasingly frail elderly population. Moreover, viral spread through the social intimacy that characterizes elderly care is plausibly associated with a higher viral load of initial infection as compared with random contact, a factor implicated in disease severity (Liu et al, 2020) .",

As shown in Column 2, life expectancy at 65 can vary by as much as 25% from the minimum (Bulgaria) to the maximum (France). An average 65-year-old in Spain, for example, can expect to outlive an average 65-year-old in Germany by 1.6 years, translating into 8% more life years. Also note how the rank order of countries by life expectancy at 65 behaves very differently than the population share of elderly (\u2265 65 years of age). In fact, in the European context, these two variables are statistically independent of each other (r = 0.083, p = 0.669). 1",

Each country is sized and colored by its corresponding natural log of life expectancy at 65, with yellow reflecting the lowest and black reflecting the highest life expectancy at 65. Note how both the death rate (y-axis) and first death timing (x-axis) of the COVID-19 epidemic across European countries are ordered intelligibly by the color ramp of life expectancy at 65. [INSERT FIGURE 2] In Figure 3, we decompose Figure 2. In Panel A, we find that the natural log of the COVID-19 death rate is manifestly upward sloping in elderly longevity. Individual countries are colored by the same ramp in Figure 2, with yellow reflecting the lowest and black reflecting the highest life expectancy at 65. The statistical relationship is strong (r = 0.839, p < .001) and indicates that higher life expectancy at 65 predicts a higher COVID-19 death rate. In Panel B, we graph the relationship between the date of epidemic initiation and elderly longevity. Here the relationship is discernably downward sloping (r = \u22120.634, p < .001) indicating that higher life expectancy at 65 predicts earlier epidemic timing. 3 The COVID-19 appears to manifest earlier in countries with higher population frailty. [INSERT FIGURE 3] Next, in Figure 4 we map the spatial coincidence of COVID-19 death rates and life expectancy for observed European countries. Again, countries in yellow have the lowest and countries in black have the highest life expectancy at 65. Hyper-imposed on the map are grey circles of varying size,",
