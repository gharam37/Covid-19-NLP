The overall aim is to prevent an overload of the medical system. Even within one country, there is frequently a strong local variability in both -political sanctions as well as other local factors -which may influence infection rates. The main focus of study is analysis and interpretation of recent temporal developments (infection rates). We present a statistical framework designed to identify local factors which reduce infection rates. The approach is robust with respect to the number of undetected infection cases. We apply the framework to spatio-temporal infection data from Germany. In particular, we demonstrate that (1) infection rates are in average significantly decreasing in Germany; (2) there is a high spatial variability of these rates, and (3) both, early emergence of first infections and high local infection densities has led to strong recent decays in infection rates, suggesting that psychological effects (such as awareness of danger) lead to behaviour changes that reduce infection rates. However, the full potential of the presented method cannot yet be exploited, since more precise spatio-temporal data, such as local cell phone-based mobility data, are not yet available. In the nearest future, the presented framework could be applied to data from other countries at any state of infection, even during the exponential phase of the growth of infection rates.",

The disease is caused by a novel virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2. Transmission of the virus between humans is known to happen via respiratory droplets and until today, no specific medical treatment for the disease is known. The virus was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019. The disease had spread widely over the province of Hubei, but was contained after strict quarantine imposed on January 23, 2020. The peak of daily confirmed cases of about 4000 was reached on February 3, ten days after the quarantine had been imposed; then the number of daily new cases decreased below 100 at the beginning of March [8] . Until today nearly exponential growth has been observed in several countries worldwide including, e.g., Italy, Spain, and the U.S. Despite the exponential increase, several countries have already observed a decrease in the daily number of infections (e.g. South Korea, Italy, Spain, and Germany).",

The framework is optimised to reveal factors that explain differences in recent infection rates among different sub-regions. Thus, in the light of high variability of possible local political, social, environmental or infrastructural factors that may affect the infection rates, the proposed tool provides an opportunity to extract the most important factors responsible for COVID-19 propagation. This is important not only to reduce the exponential rate of infection growth in different countries, but also to decide which sanctions can be eased if the maximum of the confirmed daily new cases has been surpassed, as it is currently the case in Germany and several other countries.",

Additive regression models allow to estimate nonlinear dependencies between predictor variables (here e.g. the date) and an outcome variable (here e.g. the number of reported infections) [7, 21] . Consideration of such nonlinearities is fundamental here, since the initial increase and possible later decrease in infection numbers is often strongly nonlinear. In particular (if not stated otherwise) the optimal smoothness has been determined using generalised cross-validation methods [18] . Random intercepts (i.e., the use of mixed modelling [2, 21] ) have been applied if data are not independent, but instead nested within certain units (such as states). Since infection numbers are additionally temporally autocorrelated (infection numbers depend to some degree on the number of the day before), an auto-regression (AR) structure of order 1 has been added to the model. Finally, a negative-binomial probability distribution has been used, to account for the fact that infection numbers do not follow a normal distribution but are (possibly overdispersed) count data [9, 20, 21] . In addition to the date, also the weekday has been introduced as a smooth, in particular as a cyclic smooth [18] in order to partial out the distinct effect of the weekday on reported infection numbers.",

All other model specifications were as described above for the calculation of \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 . The advantage of the non-smooth (log-linear) incorporation of the date variable, here, \u03b2 3 (the slope of the average log-linear development) was represented by a corresponding date-dependent regression coefficient, and thus confidence intervals respectively standard errors could be computed, the latter representing the certainty of each estimate. Furthermore, after slight reformulations, \u03b2 3 can be directly interpreted, namely in terms of average percentage change in infection rates per day. A possible disadvantage of \u03b2 3 compared to \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 is that a shorter time series (and thus less data) have been used, which was necessary to select a time frame with nearly log-linear behaviour of infection rates corresponding to the model.

We tested the following variables: On the ADlevel we introduced Longitude, Latitude (as well as their interaction term), the date of the first reported COVID-19 infection (first infection), the local percentage of people older than 65 years (Age) (data from https://www-genesis.destatis.de), the population density (Density), and the local infection intensity (percentage of people infected by COVID-19 -infection density).

The subsequent GAM-analysis with these predictors reveals a negative regression coefficient for infection density (-74.6, 95 %-CI: [-177.8,17.5] ) suggesting that higher local infection densities lead to stronger current decays of infection rates. The psychological effect of perceived abstractness of the threat might be the reason for this: as long as the total number of infected in an area is low, it is highly probable that an individual does not know anyone infected personally and the threat is perceived to be very abstract. If in contrast an area is affected by a high number of infections, it his more probable that someone knows somebody who is infected (and/or the region is more present in the media) and the threat is suddenly perceived as very real, which may induce a much stronger change to a more preventive behaviour. Furthermore, there is a highly significant positive regression coefficient for Retail recreation (0.061, 95 %-CI: [0.02,0.1]) indicating that a high use of places like restaurants, cafes, shopping centres, theme parks, museums, libraries, and movie theatres prevents the recent decay of infection rates.

The subsequent GAM-analysis with these predictors reveals highly significant dependencies on infection density and first infection. In particular, the positive regression coefficient for first infection (0.02, 95 %-CI: [0.01,0.03]) indicates that infection rates decay the stronger the earlier the first infection in this region has been detected. At first glance, one might think that an earlier start leads to an earlier decay due to the natural progression of the infection curve. However, the 'natural progression' would be a further increase for a long time, which only saturates or decreases to changes in behaviour. The latter can be caused either by intrinsic (psychological) or extrinsic factors (sanctions). Since sanctions (such as curfews) have been realised approximately at the same time everywhere in Germany (with only differences of some days), the observed decay in connection with early detected infections is also most probably a result of the above mentioned psychological factors. A highly significant negative value for infection density (-97.2, 95 %-CI: [-135.6,-58.9]) suggest again that high local infection densities lead to stronger current decays of infection rates. Thus, both effects are most probably related to the above described awareness of the thread. Furthermore, the positive regression coefficient for Age (0.022, 95 %-CI: [-0.002,0.045]) indicates that in regions with more people older than 65, infection rates decay less. This might be explained by the fact that younger people may show a more mobile behaviour (e.g. due to their work) so that sanctions (such as curfew) might affect them in a stronger way. Other factors might be that older people are possibly less frighten (due to more life experience), and it also could be more difficult for them to substantially change their habits. The negative value for Transit stations (-0.012, 95 %-CI: [-0.027,0.002]) finally indicates that an increased use of public transport leads to a decrease of recent infection rates. This result is counter-intuitive, and we therefore think that here, possibly a random correlation was detected. Indeed, this result is statistically non-significant and movement data have been introduced only at the coarse federal statelevel. For future work, such data with a finer spatial resolution (such as currently available for the UK https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-04-05_GB_Mobility_Report_en.pdf) would allow for more reliably estimates.",

Since only relative changes in detected infections are considered, the approach is robust with respect to the percentage of undetected infections, as long as the latter does not locally change in time. The approach has been applied to spatio-temporal COVID-19 infection data in Germany. Nevertheless, it can be adapted to other countries at any state of infection, provided that both, infection numbers and factors affecting them, are provided in a sufficient spatio-temporal resolution. The analysis of daily COVID-19 infections in Germany reveals that (1) currently, infections are in average significantly decreasing; (2) there is a strong spatial variability in the local recent infection rates, especially varying in the centre of Germany (mostly including the two states Th\u00fcringen and Hessen); (3) there are strong evidences that both, an early emergence of first infections and high local infection densities, lead to strong recent decays in infection rates. The latter may indicate that psychological effects (such as the awareness of danger due to infection cases in the circle of friends and acquaintances) lead to a more cautious behaviour, which again reduces the local risk of additional infections.",

(d)-(f) example plots of reported infection numbers for three AD's with a recent decay (d), saturation (e) and increase (f). (g) country-wide total daily reported infection numbers, (h)-(i) smoothed GAMM plot of total infection numbers, where (h) is the partial effect of the date, and (i) is the partial effect of the weekday. In all sub-figures (except (g)) the y axis cannot be interpreted in absolute values since either curves have been normalised for each AD, or partial effect plots are shown. All rights reserved.

As described within the material and methods section, \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 are calculated based on the entire time frame (starting with February 22th), whereas \u03b2 3 represents the percentage change in infection rates per day during the last 20 days. Three examples for differently developing sub-regions (ADs) are shown in (d)-(e) (all from the state Bayern): (d) shows a recent decay, (e) a saturation and (f) a recent increase. However, it is obvious that the majority of curves in (a)-(c) show a recent decay in infection rates.",
