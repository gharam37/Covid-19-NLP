The left puzzle is the history and function of the insertion at S1/S2 boundary, which is uniquely identified in SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we identified two variants from the first Guangdong SARS-CoV-2 cell strain, with deletion mutations on polybasic cleavage site (PRRAR) and its flank sites. More extensive screening indicates the deletion at the flank sites of PRRAR could be detected in 3 of 68 clinical samples and half of 22 in vitro isolated viral strains. These data indicate (1) the deletion of QTQTN, at the flank of polybasic cleavage site, is likely benefit the SARS-CoV-2 replication or infection in vitro but under strong purification selection in vivo since it is rarely identified in clinical samples;",

The corresponding original samples for these strains were collected between 19 th January and 28 th February 2020. Multiplex-PCR combined with the nanopore sequencing was used, following the general protocol as described in (https://artic.network/ncov-2019). The ARTIC pipeline was applied to trimmed primers and generated the bam files, which included all reads mapping to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (MN908947.3). Variant sites were called by using iVar 7 with depth >=20 as a threshold. With this method, 10 of 21 cell isolate strains have different ratios of variants (>10%) with deletion at the flank of the polybasic cleavage site (deletion at 23585-23599) ( Figure C) . One has the variant with deletion on the polybasic cleavage site (deletion at 23596-23617). To find out whether the deletion on 23585-23599 was restricted in a specific genetic lineage, we next investigated the phylogenetic relationship of these strains and first 014 strain described above. As shown in Figure D , the strains with a relative higher ratio of this deletion were dispersed in the phylogenetic tree suggesting the deletion mutation was not restricted to a specific genetic lineage of SARS-CoV-2 viruses.",

Therefore, the genetic character of the spike protein in SARs-CoV-2 would shed light on its origin and evolution. For SARs-CoV-1, strong positive selection has been identified in the spike codingsequence 8 and deletions in the other gene segment 9 at the early stage but not the late stage of the epidemic, suggesting the adaptive pressures operated on the SARS-CoV-1 genome at the beginning of the epidemic. This result also indicates the SARs-CoV-1 may not well established in the human population at the early stage when it first transmitted from an intermediate animal host. For SARs-CoV-2, the virus presents high infectivity and efficient transmission capability among the human population since it is firstly identified 1 . Genetic changes related with viral fitness of SARs-CoV-2 require further epidemiological investigation and functional experiments. Here, we use different sequencing methods to identify and verify a deletion at sites flanking the polybasic cleavage site. The deletion variants could be detected from 3 in 68 clinical samples, but half of 22 in vitro isolated viral strains tested in this study. These data indicate (1) the deletion of QTQTN may benefit SARS-CoV-2 replication or infection in vitro (Vero-E6 cell) but is likely to be under strong purification selection in vivo since it is rarely identified in clinical samples and (2) there could be an efficient mechanism for deleting this region from the viral genome, as the variants with the 23585-23599 deletion are commonly detected after two rounds of cell passage. Notably, a recently reported SARs-like strainRmYN02, which is phylogenetically related to a SARS-CoV-2, also has a deletion at the QTQT site10 .This raises another possible scenario, which is that SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in animals may not have QTQTN in their spike protein and a variant with this insertion occurred upon virus transmission into humans.
