The WHO recommends nucleic acid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Unfortunately, in the face of the rapidly growing epidemics worldwide, an increased demand for diagnostic tests has led to a critical shortage in operational material for respiratory sample collection and within the molecular diagnostic workflow [3, 4] . This impedes rapid large scale testing, a necessity for controlling the epidemic. Moreover, the heterogeneity of respiratory sample material and anatomical location of sample collection, for example throat swab, saliva or endotracheal aspirate, affect the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid testing [5, 6] .

This notably lower sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG detection is in agreement to that observed here for the Euroimmun IgG ELISA (65%). In the present study the Wantai IgG and Euroimmun IgG ELISAs could not be compared due to unavailability of the former. The possibility that overall lower sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISAs may be a more universal occurrence rather than manufacturer dependent warrants further investigation. In addition to lower sensitivities, the Euroimmun IgA and IgG ELISAs are also more prone to cross-react with negative sera as described in the present study and in a separate analysis of the beta-versions of these assays [10].",

Both kits detect antibodies to the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein; however, the Wantai Total Ab ELISA only targets the RBD within the S1. The RBD represents approximately 33% of the S1 subunit, thus epitopes that may be recognized by cross-reacting epitopes outside of this domain are absent. Furthermore, the RBD is highly diverse between SARS-CoV-2 and other beta-coronaviruses (hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-HKU1), which may further reduce the likelihood of cross-reaction with these circulating coronaviruses. Moreover, the Wantai Total Ab ELISA uses an antigen-antibody-antigen(peroxidase) format whereas the Euroimmun ELISAs employ an antigen-antibody-antibody(peroxidase) format. The specificity of the former is determined by a single antibody, whereas the latter has a second antibody that may introduce additional specificities. The antigen-antibody-antibody format is required to distinguish between specific antibody types, but may not necessarily have lead to decreased specificity as shown for in-house ELISAs [10].",

In conclusion, our findings show that in an ELISA format the sensitivity of detecting total SARS-CoV-2 RBDspecific antibodies is higher than that of assays detecting spike-specific IgA or IgG only. It is important to note that the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies does not necessarily correspond to protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease. In order to define antibody-mediated protection, further investigation of virus-specific antibody functions that include neutralization and Fc-mediated effector functionality are needed. Sero-epidemiological investigations together with longitudinal studies on sequential samples taken from SARS-CoV-2 patients are necessary to characterize the spread of the virus and the long term protection of the antibodies measured. Due to comparatively poorer assay performance in an initial round of testing, further testing were suspended.",

On the contrary, cross-reactive IgM antibodies resulted in decreased specificity of two POC tests evaluated. This IgM-associated reduced specificity was not observed for all POC tests, thus other unknown factors define POC test specificity. POC tests are, by definition, often performed beside the patient, whereas ELISAs are conducted in laboratories. This study demonstrated that while certain ELISA assays and POC tests may share similar sensitivities and specificities, their results may not necessarily correspond for a single patient sample. These discrepancies should be noted where SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs are used to confirm POC test results.Since the appearance of antibodies is time dependent, diagnosis of COVID-19 by serological methods is limited to patients with a longer duration of illness. Within seven days of symptom onset or in the acute phase of disease, nucleic acid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples is superior to antibody detection for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [7,8,12]. However, after eight days of illness, the sensitivity of serological assays surpasses that of nucleic acid testing [7,8]. Here we reported a 100% seropositivity in patients 10 days after the onset of symptoms. It is unclear whether the latter sensitivity can be extrapolated to mild COVID-19 cases, since the present study comprised severely ill adult COVID-19 patients only. However, the sensitivity of the assay may not necessarily be very affected, since reports show similar seroconversion rates for patients with mild and severe COVID-19 disease despite generally lower SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres in the former group [6,7,13]. Conversely, studies on the dynamics and detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children are lacking and requires urgent attention.",
