However, COVID-19 is spreading in different rates at different countries. Here, we tested the effect of three classes of predictors, i.e., socioeconomic, climatic and transport, on the rate of daily increase of COVID-19. We found that global connections, represented by countries' importance in the global air transportation network, is the main explanation for the growth rate of COVID-19 in different countries. Climate, geographic distance and socioeconomics did not affect this big picture analysis. Geographic distance and climate were significant barriers in the past but were surpassed by the human engine that allowed us to colonize almost every corner on Earth. Based on our global analysis, the global network of air transportation could lead to a worst-case scenario of synchronous global pandemic if board control measures in international airports were not taken and are not sustained during this pandemic. Despite all limitations of a global analysis, our results indicate that the current claims that the growth rate of COVID-19 may be lower in tropical countries should be taken very carefully, at risk to disturb well-established and effective policy of social isolation that may help to avoid higher mortality rates due to collapse of national health systems. This is the case of Brazil, a well-connected tropical country that presents the second highest increase rate of COVID-19 and might experience a serious case of human-induced disasters if decision makers take into consideration unsupported claims of the growth rate of COVID-19 might be lower in tropical countries.",

Thus, at this point of the pandemic, there is still a distributional disequilibrium that can generate very biased predictions based on climatic correlative modeling (De Marco et al. 2008) . Thus, here we used an alternative macroecological approach (e.g., Burnside et al. 2012) to investigate variations on the growth rates of SARS-CoV-2, based on the geographical patterns of exponential growth rates of the disease at country level. We studied the effect of environment, socioeconomic and global transportation controlling for spatial autocorrelation that could bias model significance. By analyzing these factors, we show that the exponential growth of COVID-19 is not driven by climatic and socioeconomical variables at global scale and is explained mainly by country's importance in global transportation network (i.e., air transportation).",

The rates of increase of new cases of COVID-19 is faster in some countries than others. To understand why growth rates are different among countries we investigate the effect of climatic, socioeconomical and human transportation variables that could have important roles on the exponential phase of COVID-19. At global scale, temperature, precipitation, mean number of school years, Gross National Income and health investments had no significant effect on the exponential phase of COVID-19, suggesting that the fast initial spreading of the disease might behave similarly in different countries, despite differences in climatic and socioeconomic conditions. Countries' importance in the global transportation network is the only variable with a significant association with COVID-19 growth rates (Fig 2) .",

It is quite likely that further phases of COVID-19 spread, in terms of peak of infections and decrease in mortality rates, are better related to socioeconomics characteristics of each county and their political decisions when secondary transmissions were identified. We can already clearly identify the effects of adopting strong social isolation policies in China (see Kraemer et al. 2020 ) and, on the opposite side of this spectrum, in European countries like Italy, Spain and England (Enserink and Kupferschmidt 2020).

It is also critical to consider the negative correlations between climate and local or regional socioeconomic conditions (i.e., inadequate sanitary conditions and poor nutritional conditions) that could easily counteract any potential climatic effect at local scales, such as lower survival rates of viruses exposed to high temperatures and high UV irradiation (Duan et al. 2003 , Wang et al. 2020 . Tropical regions will experience mild climate conditions in a couple of months. Thus, regardless of the influence of local environmental conditions, tropical countries could still expect high contagious rates. Finally, climatic suitability models might be ephemeral for very mathematized modelling fields of science such as epidemiology and virology that developed over time very realistic models that enables the possibility of learning with parameters of similar viruses (i.e. SARS) that can definitely help and instruct decision makers to take actions before it is too late.",
