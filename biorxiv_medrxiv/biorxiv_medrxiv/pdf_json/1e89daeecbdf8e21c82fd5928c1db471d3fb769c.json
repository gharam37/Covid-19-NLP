The number of confirmed cases seems less compared to other countries. However, taking into account the 1.3 billion population of India, it was necessary to take strict and essential measures as soon as possible. Within days of the epidemic, the Indian government ordered schools closure, religious events with large gatherings were either canceled or postponed. The local authorities encouraged residents to minimize the travel, avoid crowded places, and promoted physical distancing, travel restrictions imposed between states and cities, undoubtedly played a significant role in reducing the exposure and delayed the onset of the outbreak in several towns and villages in India.",

The US has surpassed the position and recorded maximum cases of 216,721, including 5,137 deaths.

The primary reasons for the maximum death toll in Italy or other European countries like Spain are because of the slow response to the outbreak, delayed decisions on travel ban, and locking down the country. Italy is the second-largest country with the oldest population in the world, lack of testing kits, lack of social distancing practice due to the family cultures. However, China's Wuhan region was locked down since mid-January from the rest of the world, and they have not reported any new positive cases for many days. Interestingly, it seems like strict lockdowns appear to have an extraordinary impact on controlling the disease (7).",

The capacity to perform tests on 1.3 billion people is still a question. Alternatively, the only way to minimize unnecessary deaths is to extend the period of country lockdown for the next few weeks. Studies reported on 1918-19 pandemic suggest that holds and delays in proposing social distancing actions are associated with excess fatality (8, 9) . Another major issue in India is more than half of the population lives on daily wages who require the basic need of living that includes food and shelter.

The intention immediately is to raise this figure to satisfy pressing coming demands securely.

These problems are majorly applicable to other underdeveloped or developing countries where a suitable quantity of intensive care facilities are not available and not feasible to produce in such a short period.

These maximum cases are calculated using the predicted growth rate and the formula given later in this section to compute new cases per day.Given all the information above, it is also possible to estimate the number of cases on the next day. This estimate is valuable to prepare our National Health systems and government for the expected catastrophe.
