We do this by way of a cross-country comparison and put forward some reasons for potential differences.",

Despite the variation in symptomatology and health complications from the disease presents greater health and mortality risks in individuals at higher ages and in those with pre-existing medical conditions. In the worst affected countries, there are spikes in hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths. The health systems of these countries are being stretched to the limit. The morbidity impact of the virus is attracting considerable attention, especially as the availability of intensive care units is being exceeded by the number of cases requiring critical care.",

Thirteen days later, on March 28, 2020 there were almost 31000 deaths globally --an almost fivefold increase. Surprisingly, there has not been much focus on the age pattern of COVID-19 deaths thus far though attempts have been made to understand the differences in case fatality rates between countries (1-3). We explore differences in the age distribution of COVID-19 deaths among European countries with older age structures: France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain (subsample). We do this via a cross-country comparison of the age-patterns in observed COVID -19 death counts and their counterfactual distribution adjusted by the age-structure of Italy. We include Chinese data for comparison. See Supplementary Material for methodological details.",

Above age 80, the proportion of deaths is 50% , 58% , 59% and 59% for Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and France respectively. These differences between the countries persist after adjustment for age-structure. ",

This phenomenon is particularly evident in the case of the Netherlands where the population difference to Italy at ages above age 80 is in the millions. Therefore, age structure is only partially predictive of the deaths at older ages.

Second, we could be observing the outworking of country-specific cohort effects where particular cohorts are impacted differently between different countries. Third, differences may be reflective of different levels in old age frailty between countries. The countries with the most robust individuals at a given age group would be less likely to succumb to COVID-19. Finally, underlying medical conditions which are exacerbated by the presence of COVID-19 and viceversa may be more prevalent in some populations compared to others. This would result in more severe illness and ultimately, higher deaths in one country versus the other.",

The differences in the agepatterns of COVID-19 deaths are not only dependent on the age-structure of a given population, but also on other country-specific factors. A better grasp of these is crucial to gain a greater understanding of the age pattern of COVID-19 deaths.",
