When a system is continuously changing over time (e.g., infectious diseases) differential equations, which may include parameters, are used for modeling the system. The process of finding those parameters that best fit the given data from the system is called an inverse problem. This study aims at analyzing the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) spread in South Korea using the susceptible-infectedrecovered (SIR) model. We collect the data from Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC). We assume that each parameter in the SIR model is a function of time so that we can compute important parameters, such as the basic reproduction number (R0), more delicately. Using neural networks, we propose a method to find the best time-varying parameters and the solution for the model simultaneously. Moreover, using time-dependent parameters, we find that traditional numerical algorithms, such as the Runge-Kutta methods, can successfully approximate the SIR model while fitting the COVID-19 data, thus modeling the propagation patterns of COVID-19 more precisely.",

At the end of World War I, the 1918 influenza pandemic wreaked havoc on the whole world, killing more than 40 million people, more than 2% of the then world's population of 1.8 billion people. It is estimated that 16 million people died in India, which suffered the most damage, while in the US, the pandemic killed 5.2% of the entire population [1] . Additionally, it had a catastrophic impact on the world economy. For example, manufacturing production fell by an average of 18% in the US, since many people died or became sick, resulting in a devastating loss in the workforce, while the fears of infection caused a decrease in consumption and production. During the outbreak, preventive measures such as social distancing and wearing masks were recommended to curb the spread of the virus. However, the 1918 influenza pandemic exhibited an unusual bimodal peak in the US, lasting for almost two years. Thus, by analogy, we can infer that decreases in infection rates of COVID-19 do not guarantee continuity of the trend.",

Even countries that have successfully imposed quarantine measures early, such as Taiwan and Hong Kong, cannot rule out the possibility of a COVID-19 re-outbreak. Therefore, governments and academia need to collect and analyze all COVID-19related data using big data technologies in real time to monitor the pandemic by region and time quantitatively.

Other studies, such as [4] , divided the phase manually and regarded the parameters as time-varying piece-wise constants. Moreover, [5, 6] considered the parameters as functions of time and proposed methods to approximate the time-varying parameters. Additionally, [7, 8] have shown that neural networks (NNs) with proper loss functions represent a powerful tool for solving forward-inverse problems.

We regard the modeling problem as a forward-inverse problem, and approximate each variable (S, I, R) and parameter (\u03b2, \u03b3) in the model using deep learning. Moreover, to overcome the shortcomings of previous studies, we consider the parameters as functions of time, which allows us to compute the infection rate, recovery rate, and the time-dependent reproduction number, R T D . This approach is more interpretable, since \u03b2(t), \u03b3(t), R T D can be obtained as functions of time, as well as the overall dynamics of the actual data. Additionally, unlike other models, such as the growth model, we do not assume any distribution type for the modeling. In the traditional growth model, one considers the growth rate as a piecewise constant function to compute the effective reproduction number. However, this assumption is not realistic in many cases, as the reproduction number could dramatically change. In contrast, the time-dependent nature of our model makes it an appropriate solution for such problems. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulation results that guarantee the convergence of our NN approach. Finally, our methodology is applicable to many areas dealing with differential equations, and easy to implement without a deep understanding of the model.",

            "text": "In this section, we provide the simulation results for five NN models: S net , I net , R net , \u03b2 net , and \u03b3 net and the corresponding relative errors |Observed value\u2212Network value| |Observed value| \u00d7 100(%) for S, I, R. For a more accurate evaluation of the model parameters, we also provide numerical solutions (Runge-Kutta of order 4, (RK4)) using the estimated parameters. For the RK4 method, we set h = 10 \u22123 (step size), with 26 observations used for Seoul, Busan, and Daegu, and 77 observations for South Korea. We remark that the observations are available on the KCDC homepage, http://www.cdc.go.kr/. In Figure 7 -10, Red lines denote S net , I net , R net values for each graph, Green lines denote the observations, and Blue lines denote the RK4 results with the parameter NN \u03b2 net , \u03b3 net . In Figure 11 -14, we provide the estimated time-dependent parameters \u03b2, and \u03b3 on the left, and the time-dependent reproduction number R T D on the right. Next, we summarize the overall trend by analyzing R T D (t). First, at t = 0 in South Korea, R T D = 1.0610 implies the spread of COVID-19, see Figure 11 . Starting from 18, February, R T D (t) increased dramatically (t = 11), and reached its peak Figure 12 , right). This indicates that no effective control of the spread of COVID-19 has been achieved. The average values of \u03b2 and \u03b3 were 0.0705, 0.0140, respectively. In the third case, Busan, on 5, March (t = 0), at the beginning of the observation, \u03b2 was 0.1300 ( Figure 9 , left bottom,) while R T D was 156.7965. This is because R(t), the recovery group, did not change in the initial stage, whereas \u03b3 was estimated to be 0.0008 due to the constraint \u03b3 > 0. On 8, March (t = 3), R T D was 0.0908 because of the change in R(t), reaching 0.5401 on 30, March (t = 25). We also provide two R T D plots by dividing the observation period into two periods in Figure 13 . The average values of \u03b2 and \u03b3 were 0.0253, 0.0670, respectively. In the final case, Daegu, similar to Busan, R T D was 521.9075 at the beginning of the observation on 5, March (t = 0). After 11, March (t = 6), the recovery rate \u03b3 began to increase faster than the infection rate \u03b2, with the R T D having the lowest value 0.1224 on 24, March (t = 19). After 24, March, R T D increased reaching 0.2409 on 30, March (t = 25), see Figure 14 . The average values of \u03b2 and \u03b3 were 0.0191, 0.0387, respectively. ",
