This study involves assessing how the disease affected the population in the initial days of the epidemic. Data was collected from government-controlled and crowdsourced websites and analyzed. Studying age and sex parameters of 413 Indian COVID-19 patients, the median age of the affected individuals was found to be 36 years (IQR, 25-54) with 20-39 years males being the most affected group. The number of affected males (66.34%) was more than that of the females (33.66%). Using Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model, the range of contact rate (\u03b2) of India was calculated and the role of public health .

The causative agent was determined to be a novel virus of the Coronaviridae family of RNA viruses and was claimed to be of zoonotic origin (1). Due to its close relationship with the SARS-CoV, this novel coronavirus was named SARS-CoV-2 (2). Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has caused a widespread outbreak of the disease now known as COVID- 19 and was declared to be a pandemic by WHO on March 11 2020 (3) . Human to human transmission occurs primarily through close-contact with the infected person, through fomites in the immediate surroundings of the infected person and via droplets of respiratory secretions (4, 5), although there is limited evidence pointing to a possibility of airborne and faeco-oral transmission as well (6, 7) . According to few case studies, transmission may also occur via viral shedding in \"presymptomatic\" individuals during the incubation period (8, 9) .",

In study cohorts of Wuhan, the median age of affected patients ranges from 49-56 years (4, 23, 24). Thus, there are more people affected at a lower age in India when compared to China. This observation can be explained by the population distribution of India. In previous studies on COVID-19, it has been established that the risk increases with age and comorbidities (13, 23, 24). However, according to the population demographics in India for 2020 (25), the broad based nature of India's population pyramid means there are more people in the younger age group and very few people in the equal to or above 80 years age group . This is reflected in the number of cases which are more in the younger age groups. On normalizing the percentage of patients in each age group with the corresponding percentage representation of the population, we observed that the highest number of male patients is in the 20-39 years age group category. Interestingly, according to this analysis, males in the 20-39 years age group are affected more than the 60-79 years age group males and equal to or above 80 years age group males. This is something that has not been reported until now and it has to be seen whether this changes as the number of cases in India grows.

The explanation for a lower mortality rate due to COVID-19 infection could be the universal immunisation policy against BCG (29). Case fatality rate was higher for males (4.38%) than females (2.88%). In China, the case fatality rate was found as 2.3%, 14.8% in the above 80 years population, and 8.0% in the 70-79 years population (13) . Our estimate gives a higher value which may be due a smaller sample size or can also be because mild cases of COVID 19 have so far been missed due to limited testing capacities in India. In our study, the mortality rates for 60-79 years age group (16.18%) and equal to or above 80 years age group (20%) may be an underestimation or overestimation of the actual mortality rate as the total number of deaths is still small and many are still hospitalized. The median age for recovered patients (36 years) is lower than the median ages for the deceased (65 years) implying younger patients have a higher chance of recovery. This is in accordance with findings from other countries (13, 30) . If we consider all the patients, males account for 66.34% of patients, implying more males are generally affected. 75.0% of the deceased were also males which show that males are more vulnerable agreeing with previous studies (31, 32).",

The increase in \u03b2 from day 8 is probably due to the identification of the Tablighi cluster and the cases it added to the Indian data (34). The impact of the COVID-19 response (overall quarantine regulations , social distancing, and isolation of infections) in China in this context is encouraging for the many other countries (36) where the Rt gradually stabilized for most provinces ranging between 0.96 to 1.57 where there were more than 100 cases (33), and India should try and replicate this when community transmission starts by strict enforcement of lockdown measures to get the Rt closer to 1,so that COVID would not overwhelm the Indian healthcare system. The Indian government will not be able to minimise both deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the economic impact of viral spread. Keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence the Indian government must put in place measures to ameliorate the inevitable .

However the Indian government's timely decision to put a country wide lockdown into place when the number of cases was documented to be only 415,and effective contact tracing definitely helped to reduce the Rt and prevent an Italy/US like situation (however in the context of violations of the lockdown, more data awaited). Since at the end of the 21 days lockdown, India is likely to have significant number of active cases (5583 to 13785), it may enter the exponential growth phase and it would become very difficult to contain it.",

As on 4 th April,2020, 1023 COVID-19 positive cases across 17 states in India can be traced to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Nizamuddin (38) . Additionally, ICMR recently updated the testing strategy which might have increased the detection of the positive cases significantly (39) . For now the epidemic is being reported either in clusters or superclusters and community transmission is still in its infancy. If the disease leaks into the rural areas or urban slums, it will provide a big challenge to the health care delivery system which is not yet ready to combat the epidemic. India might as well enter the exponential phase of growth of the epidemic curve if stringent measures are not in place. Hence, strict social distancing, optimum testing and acceptance and awareness in Indian community are vital elements to control the COVID-19 epidemic in India.",
