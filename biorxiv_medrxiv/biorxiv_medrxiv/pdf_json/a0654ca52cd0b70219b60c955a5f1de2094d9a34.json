Our model focuses on unreported cases, asymptomatic infectious cases, and the division of the epidemic evolution through a succession of phases. Our method can be predictive, when the epidemic is growing exponentially in Phase II. In [1] we demonstrated a method to identify the Phase II exponentially increasing rate of cumulative reported cases. When public measures are begun in Phase II, to ameliorate the epidemic, we model these measures with a time-dependent exponentially decreasing transmission rate. These measures result in a subsequent reduction in daily reported cases, which we call Phase III. We determine the transition from Phase II to Phase III, which may require more than a week, in the model simulations.",

It is evident that these measures should start as early as possible, and should be as strong as possible. If the epidemic subsides substantially due to these measures, the example of South Korea shows that a background level of daily cases may persist for an extended time. If major distancing measures are reduced too early or too extensively, the epidemic may return to new Phase II, with exponentially increasing cumulative cases. A possible control of COVID-19 epidemics is evidenced by the example of South Korea. The future of COVID-19 epidemics and their human toll is at present uncertain, and it is hopeful that mathematical models can be of use.",
