Participants joined using both video and audio. All focus groups were organised and moderated by SW (a medical social scientist). The topic guide for the focus groups was initially developed using existing literature on public attitudes and experiences in past pandemics and was tested and refined in a pilot focus group.

All focus groups were recorded and transcribed for coding. SW and KD analysed the transcripts and developed and applied the thematic coding framework. Themes were discussed and developed with CJA and TT during virtual research group meetings. To help analysis we looked to validate \"sensitive moments\" between groups that indicated difficult but important issues. [16] Negative case analysis was used to seek for information that did not fit emergent themes, and where this occurred, themes were modified accordingly. [17] . Following a grounded theory approach, data were organised into primary and more focused codes that provided insight into identified themes. [14, 18] Data collection and analysis continued until saturation occurred (that is, until no new significant themes emerged). [18] Data were analysed in NVivo (version 11.4.3, QRS). ",

Second, non-adherence was seen to be due to a lack of understanding. For example, participants argued that people who were not observing social distancing lacked knowledge over how they could help spread the disease even if they themselves were not exhibiting symptoms. Third, non-adherence was seen to be due to a lack of enforcement.

However, contrary to previous research which suggests that adherence with pandemic NPIs is lower in instances where people have low trust in government and where people perceive themselves at relatively low risk from the disease, [7] our participants were highly adherent to social distancing and isolation measures, despite many lacking trust in government and perceiving themselves at low risk. In fact, stigma was more likely to be attributed to those who were failing to socially distance and isolate. Of course, as noted above the scale and severity of the pandemic and subsequent measures are unprecedented. As such, although there is existing research on its likely effects, [6] and although quantitative research is starting to emerge, [11] there is to, our knowledge, no published qualitative evidence on public perceptions and experiences of the psychological and social public experiences of COVID-19 related social distancing and isolation, and its relation to adherence -a gap this study addresses.",

[12, 20] Another limitation of this study is that it did not recruit participants who are deemed at particularly high risk from COVID-19-related complications, for example, individuals aged 70 and over and those living with certain chronic health conditions. [21] Because these individuals are likely to have been significantly affected by social distancing and isolation policy (being required to self-isolate for 12 weeks), their views will be important. It is also worth noting that our recruitment material did encourage those at high risk to apply, though we received no applications from those over-70. This may be partly due to the fact that those over-70 are a hard-to-reach group online, because they are significantly less likely to use social media or be heavy internet users, [22] which, due to the lack of online social support and interaction, might mean they are at particularly high risk of some of the negative social and psychological impacts discussed in this paper. Future research will explore at-risk groups' experiences in depth. Future papers will also explore further the similarities and differences in views and experiences in the perceptions of experiences of participants living in different parts of the UK (e.g. London compared to less densely populated areas), a theme only briefly discussed here due to limitations of scope.",

Looking ahead to later stages in the current pandemic, or to the development of pandemic preparedness programmes for the future, a couple of lessons can be distilled, which warrant urgent attention. Firstly, initial high levels of support for, and adherence to, social distancing and isolation measures are likely to wane over time, particularly where end dates are and remain uncertain. Secondly, in planning the 'exit strategy' for the UK lockdown, and its possible impact on future resurgences of COVID-19 .
