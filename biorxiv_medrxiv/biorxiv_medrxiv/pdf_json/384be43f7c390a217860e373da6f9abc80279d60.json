SARS-CoV-2 has a robust person-to-person transmission rate and an asymptomatic period of two weeks or more, leading to widespread infection that has overwhelmed healthcare infrastructures around the globe. Effective public health measures require extensive, accurate, and rapid testing to determine infection rates. Here we describe the strategy we used to establish a CLIA-licensed clinical laboratory to perform a validated Laboratory-Developed Test (LDT) for SARS-CoV-2 in Berkeley, California and the surrounding Bay Area community. Our procedures for implementing the technical, regulatory, and data management workstreams necessary for clinical sample processing provide a roadmap to aid others in setting up similar testing centers.",

UTM maintains the activity of the virus and stabilizes it during transport. To avoid receiving live virus at the testing site, other research centers transitioning to clinical testing sites have instituted RNA extraction at the medical facility prior to delivery to the testing facility. In our case, our partner health center did not have the capacity to perform pre-testing preparation. To protect our staff from active virus arriving on site, we created our own sample collection kits using DNA/RNA Shield from Zymo Research instead of UTM.

Separately, the City of Berkeley Public Health Department has established a partnership with LifeLong Medical Care to requisition tests and collect specimens for first responders (e.g. firefighters) and the homeless. The IGI is partnering with LifeLong and receiving samples from these individuals as well. One challenge has been to design sample collection kits and clinician protocols for both groups, such that specimens arriving at the IGI from different sources can be accessioned and tested together.

The Tang Center and LifeLong are responsible for requisitioning a test for a patient, collecting the specimen, and integrating that sample into their EMR.

Our RT-qPCR-based test shows a reproducible limit of detection of 1 x 10 3 viral genomic copies/ml, comparing favorably to other validated tests in current use for community testing. We encountered several bottlenecks to converting an academic research laboratory into a clinical diagnostic testing facility, and we share our experience here to help others with this process. First and foremost, the laboratory must ensure that it meets the regulatory requirements for infrastructure and staff, including CLIA certification, HIPAA compliance, and FDA authorization. In our experience, extending the license from an existing CLIA certified and licensed facility, using online HIPAA training and adapting a commercially available FDA certified test for use with our equipment saved time and resources. In addition, we managed supply chain bottlenecks by using donated equipment, reducing the test-sample volume used in our assay, adopting in-house sample barcoding, and adapting materials such as sampling tubes to work with available equipment. To identify local sources of PPE, we posted a call for masks, gloves, and gowns on our website and succeeded in locating sufficient supplies for personnel use during the planned weeks of operation. Lab and supporting personnel were assigned to work in shifts and a succession plan is in place to ensure uninterrupted operation. In our experience, patient sample collection is the rate-limiting step in our sample analysis pipeline. We continue to address challenges of interfacing with health centers for patient sample intake and we will soon implement a web portal for this purpose that will be described in a future update to this manuscript.",

A : Ten known positive and ten known negative patient samples in UTM leftover from Kaiser Permanente's clinical testing facility were delivered to Sarah Stanley's BSL-3 lab at UC Berkeley where they were inactivated by diluting 1:1 in 2X DNA/RNA Shield. Decontaminated tubes were delivered to IGIB where they entered our testing pipeline, starting with arraying into 96-deep-well plates using the Hamilton STARlet robot. B : Assay quality controls. Full workflow controls were processed starting at RNA extraction in the 96-well plates. RNA extraction control is composed of Thermo Fisher's MS2 control in 1X DNA/RNA shield and PBS. Human RNA controls are composed of 200 ng/ml purified RNA from 293T cells in 1X DNA/RNA shield and PBS. PCR controls were processed starting at assembling RT-qPCR reactions and include a water control, and the Thermo Fisher kit positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA control (without MS2). The second RNA extract control from the left returned two high Ct values and one undetermined value for SARS-CoV-2. Based on our decision matrix criteria for resulting (Table 2) , this control returns a NEG result (positive for only 1 SARS-CoV-2 gene).

The Branch Chief of CDPH, Robert J. Thomas, further clarified in his March 24th letter to Laboratory Directors and Managers that while the executive order removes the licensing requirements for testing personnel, it does not alter the requirements for a laboratory director, clinical consultant, technical consultant, technical supervisor, and general supervisor. Thus, while the governor's executive order allowed us to have UC Berkeley scientists who are not licensed Clinical Laboratory Scientists (CLS) to develop and implement our testing pipeline and to recruit scientist volunteers to act as testing personnel to run the samples, it preserved the essential requirement to have licensed CLSs help to set up and oversee our testing facility. Thus, a close working relationship with the UHS Clinical Testing Laboratory was essential to our success, and UHS CLSs and its Laboratory Director provided key guidance regarding the development of our workflow and navigation of CLIA regulations. Further direct communication with CDPH Laboratory Field Services (LFS) led CDPH to approve extension of UC Berkeley's existing CLIA certificate for high-complexity testing at UHS to include a temporary second site at the Innovative Genomics Institute Building, a UC Berkeley facility, for emergency SARS-CoV-2 testing. Extending this existing CLIA certificate allowed us to work under the supervision and guidance of the Tang Center Clinical Lab's Laboratory Director and Pathologist, and with licensed CLSs in the laboratory,, meeting the requirements under Governor Newsom's executive order. Their participation in our effort was critical from a compliance perspective and has been invaluable in the scientific development of our workflow.",
