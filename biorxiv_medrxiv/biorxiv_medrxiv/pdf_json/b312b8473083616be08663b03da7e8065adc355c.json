            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) is a pandemic coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 syndrome, which can include upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms, severe respiratory distress, acute cardiac injury and death (1-4). CoV-2 is closely related to other beta-coronaviruses, including the causal agents in pandemic SARS and MERS (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively) and endemic viruses typically associated with mild URI syndromes (hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-229E) (5) (6) (7) . Clinical reports suggest that infection with CoV-2 is associated with high rates of disturbances in smell and taste perception, including anosmia (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . These observations are consistent with a case report describing a SARS patient with long term anosmia (14) and with data demonstrating that olfactory function is commonly altered after infection with endemic coronaviruses (7, (15) (16) (17) (18) . While many viruses induce transient changes in odor perception due to inflammatory responses, in at least some cases COVID-related anosmia has been reported to occur in the absence of significant nasal inflammation or coryzal symptoms (12). This observation suggests that CoV-2 might directly target odor processing mechanisms, although the specific means through which CoV-2 alters odor perception remains unknown.",

In addition, the OE contains globose basal cells (GBCs), which are primarily responsible for regenerating OSNs during normal epithelial turnover, and horizontal basal cells (HBCs), which act as reserve stem cells activated upon tissue damage (25) (26) (27) . OSNs elaborate axons that puncture the cribriform plate at the base of the skull and terminate in the olfactory bulb, whose local circuits process olfactory information before sending it to higher brain centers.",

This interaction requires cleavage of the S protein, likely by the cell surface protease TMPRSS2, although other proteases (such as Cathepsin B and L, CTSB/CTSL) may also be involved (4) (5) (6) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) . Other coronaviruses use different cell surface receptors and proteases to facilitate cellular entry, including DPP4, FURIN and HSPA5 for MERS-CoV, ANPEP for HCoV-229E, TMPRSS11D for SARS-CoV (in addition to ACE2 and TMPRSS2), and ST6GAL1 and ST3GAL4 for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (6, (33) (34) (35) . It has recently been demonstrated through single cell RNA sequencing analysis (referred to herein as scSeq) that cells from the human upper airwayincluding nasal RE goblet, basal and ciliated cells -express high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, suggesting that these RE cell types may serve as a viral reservoir during CoV-2 infection (36) . However, analyzed samples in that dataset did not include any OSNs or sustentacular cells, suggesting that tissue sampling in these experiments did not access the OE (37, 38) . Here we query both new and previously published bulk RNA-Seq and scSeq datasets from the olfactory system for expression of ACE2, TMRPSS2 and other genes implicated in coronavirus entry. We find that non-neuronal cells in the OE and olfactory bulb, including support, stem and perivascular cells, express CoV-2 entry-associated molecules, raising the possibility that infection of these non-neuronal cell types contributes to anosmia in COVID-19 patients.

The CoV-2 receptor Ace2 and the protease Tmprss2 were expressed in WOM, as were the cathepsins Ctsb and Ctsl (Figures 2A-B ) (39) . However, expression of these genes (with the exception of Ctsb) was much lower and Ace2 expression was nearly absent in purified OSN samples (Figure 2A , see Legend for counts, see Methods). Genes used for cell entry by other CoVs (except St3gal4) were also expressed in WOM, and de-enriched in purified OSNs. These samples reflected the presence of expected cell types, as the WOM sequencing data included gene expression profiles associated with a wide variety of RE and OE cells, while the purified OSN samples were specifically enriched for markers of mature OSNs. The de-enrichment of Ace2 and Tmprss2 in OSNs relative to WOM was also observed in two other mouse RNA-Seq datasets (40, 41) ( Figure S1A ).",

To identify the specific cell types that express Ace2 and Tmprss2, we performed scSeq (using the 10x Chromium platform, see Methods) on the WOM; olfactory sensory neurons did not express Ace2 in this de novo analysis (2 of 28769 mature OSNs were positive for Ace2), while expression was observed in Bowman's gland cells and HBCs in a small percentage of cells (Figures 2C-E and S1B-C, see methods). Because WOM scSeq de-enriches certain cell types (e.g., sustentacular cells), to complement these data we employed a previously established lineage tracing protocol to perform scSeq on HBCs and their descendants during injury-induced regeneration (27) . This analysis revealed that Ace2 and Tmprss2 are expressed in subsets of sustentacular cells and HBCs, as well as activated HBCs that serve to regenerate the epithelium ( Figures 2F-H and S2A ). To validate these results, we reanalyzed a similar lineage tracing dataset in which identified HBCs and their progeny were subject to Smart-seq2-based deep sequencing (27) . In this dataset, Ace2 was detected in more than 0.7% of GBCs, nearly 2% of HBCs and nearly 3% of sustentacular cells but was not detected in OSNs (Figures 2I and S2B) . Furthermore, larger percentages of HBCs, GBCs and sustentacular cells expressed Tmprss2. Taken together, these bulk RNA-Seq and scSeq mouse data demonstrate that CoV-2 cell entry-related genes are expressed in support and stem cells in the mouse OE. (39) . Normalized counts for each gene in the whole olfactory mucosa (WOM) and olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are shown. Each circle represents a biological replicate and each color indicates the category of the gene shown on the right (CoV-2 and other CoVs: genes involved in the entry of these viruses, other categories: marker genes for specific cell types such as horizontal basal cells (HBC), and sustentacular cells (SUS)). Mean \u00b1 SD normalized counts in OSNs -Ace2: 8 To address whether there are similar patterns of gene expression in human OE, we queried previously published bulk WOM RNA-Seq data derived from macaque, marmoset and human (43) , and found expression of almost all CoV-entry-related genes in all WOM samples, consistent with our observations in mouse WOM ( Figure S3A ). To identify the specific cell types in human OE that express ACE2, we quantified gene expression in scSeq derived from four human nasal biopsy samples recently reported by Durante et al (44) . As in the mouse scSeq datasets, neither ACE2 nor TMPRSS2 were detected in mature OSNs, whereas these genes were detected in both sustentacular cells and HBCs (Figures 3A-E and S3B-C). In contrast, genes relevant to cell entry of other CoVs were expressed in OSNs, as well as in other OE cell types. We confirmed the expression of ACE2 proteins via immunohistochemical staining of human olfactory epithelium biopsy tissue, which revealed expression in sustentacular and basal cells, and an absence of ACE2 protein in OSNs ( Figure 3F ). Together, these results demonstrate that sustentacular and olfactory stem cells, but not mature OSNs, are potentially direct targets of CoV-2 in the human OE.",

To address this question, we developed a two step alignment procedure in which we first sought to identify cell types that were common across the OE and RE, and then leveraged gene expression patterns in these common cell types to normalize gene expression levels across all cell types in the OE and RE ( Figure S4 ). This approach revealed a correspondences between goblet cells in the RE and Bowman's gland cells in the OE (96% mapping probability, see Methods), and between pulmonary ionocytes in the RE and a subset of microvillar cells in the OE (99% mapping probability, see Methods); after alignment, human OE sustentacular cells were found to express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 at levels similar to that observed in the remainder of the non-nasal respiratory tract ( Figure 3G ) (36) .",

ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in respiratory and olfactory cell types, but not in OSNs. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are detected in HBC (KRT5) and sustentacular (CYP2A13) cells, as well as other respiratory epithelial cell types, including respiratory ciliated (FOXJ1) cells.

MHV, mouse hepatitis virus. Given the potential for the RE and OE in the nasal cavity to be directly infected with CoV-2, we assessed the expression of Ace2 and other CoV entry genes in the mouse olfactory bulb (OB), which is directly connected to the OSNs in OE via cranial nerve I (CN I); in principle, alterations in bulb function could cause anosmia independently of functional changes in the OE. To do so, we performed scSeq (using DropSeq, see Methods) on the mouse OB, and merged these data with a previously published OB scSeq analysis, yielding a dataset with nearly 50,000 single cells (see Methods) (45) . This analysis revealed that Ace2 expression was absent from OB neurons and instead was observed only in vascular pericytes (Figures 4A-D and S5-6), which are involved in blood pressure regulation, maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, and inflammatory responses (46) . Although other potential CoV proteases were expressed in the OB, Tmprss2 was not expressed in the olfactory bulb. We also performed Smart-seq2-based deep sequencing of single OB dopaminergic neurons ( Figures 4E and S7 , see Methods), which confirmed the absence of Ace2 and Tmprss2 expression in that cell type. In addition, re-analysis of 10 deeply sequenced datasets from different regions of the nervous system demonstrated that Ace2 expression is absent from neurons, consistent with prior immunostaining results ( Figure S8 ) (47) . Together these findings suggest that OB neurons are likely not a primary site of infection, but that vascular pericytes may be sensitive to CoV-2 infection in the OB and brain.",

However, we failed to detect ACE2 expression in mature OSNs at either the transcript or protein levels. These observations suggest that CoV-2 does not directly enter OSNs, but instead may target OE support and stem cells. Similarly, neurons in the olfactory bulb fail to express ACE2, whereas vascular pericytes do.

Second, damage to support cells (which are responsible for local water balance and ionic balance) could indirectly influence signaling from OSNs to the brain; our finding that a subset of microvillar cells are homologues of pulmonary ionocyteswhich play a key role in maintaining extracellular chloride gradients in the lungis consistent with this model (48).

The survival time of mature OSNs varies based upon many factors, but on average in the mouse such neurons survive weeks to short months, rather than days or years (50, 51) .

The rodent coronavirus MHV passes from the nose to the bulb, even though rodent OSNs do not express CEACAM1, the main MHV receptor (53, 56) (Figures S1A/C and S2A), suggesting that CoVs in the nasal mucosa can reach the brain through mechanisms independent of axonal transport by sensory nerves; in this case, OB neurons express CEACAM1 ( Figure 4E ), which likely supports the ability of MHV to target these neurons and change odor perception. One speculative possibility is that local seeding of the OE with CoV-2-infected cells can result in OSNindependent transfer of virions from the nose to the bulb, perhaps via the vascular supply shared between the OB and the OSN axons that comprise CN I. Although CN I was not directly queried in our datasets, it is reasonable to infer that vascular pericytes in CN I also express ACE2, which suggests a possible route of entry for CoV-2 from the nose into the brain. Given the absence of ACE2 in OB neurons, we speculate that any central olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 is the secondary consequence of pericytemediated vascular inflammation (46) .",

Here, we assume that ACE2 protein levels follow the pattern revealed by analysis of mRNA; while our staining in human OE is consistent with this idea, it remains to be rigorously assessed in all cell types in the OE and bulb. Although current data suggest that ACE2 is the most likely receptor for CoV-2 in vivo, it is possible (although it has not yet been demonstrated) that other molecules such as BSG may enable CoV-2 entry independently of ACE2 ( Figures  3E, 3G , S1, S2) (57, 58) . We also propose that damage to the olfactory system is either due to primary infection or secondary inflammation; it is possible (although has not yet been demonstrated) that cells infected with CoV-2 can form syncytia with cells that do not express ACE2. Such a mechanism could damage neurons adjacent to infected cells. Definitive identification of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying COVID-19-mediated anosmia will require additional research. Nonetheless, our identification of cells in the OE and OB expressing molecules known to be involved in CoV-2 entry illuminates a path forward for future studies.",

Of the 865 identified OSNs, including both immature and mature cells, none of the cells express ACE2 and only 2 (0.23%) expressed TMPRSS2. In contrast, ACE2 was reliably detected in at least 2% and TMPRSS2 was expressed in close to 50% of multiple respiratory epithelial subtypes. The expression of both known cell type markers and known CoV-related genes was also examined across respiratory and olfactory epithelial cell types. For these gene sets, the mean expression in each cell type was calculated and normalized by the maximum across cell types.",

Smart-Seq2 sequencing data from Vsx2-GFP positive cells was used from the retina dataset. A subset of the expression matrix that corresponds to day 0 (i.e. control, undisturbed neurons) was used from the layer VI somatosensory cortex dataset. A subset of the data containing neurons from untreated (control) mice was used from the hypothalamic neuron dataset.

A subset comprising Type I neurons from wild type mice was used from the spiral ganglion dataset. The \"unclassified\" neurons were excluded from the visceral motor neuron dataset. A subset containing neurons that were collected at room temperature was used from the dorsal root ganglia dataset. Expression data from dorsal horn neurons obtained from C57/bl6 wild type mice, vGatcre-tdTomato and vGlut2-eGFP mouse lines was used from the spinal cord dataset. Inspection of all datasets for batch effects was performed using the scater package (version 1.10.1) (77) .
