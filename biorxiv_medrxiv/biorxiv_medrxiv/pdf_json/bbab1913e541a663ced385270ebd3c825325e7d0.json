It is now possible to construct realistic models of infectious disease dynamics for the purposes of understanding global-scale epidemics. Nevertheless, a remaining unanswered question is how best to leverage the new data to parameterize models of movement, and whether one's choice of movement model impacts modeled disease outcomes. We adapt three well-studied models of infectious disease dynamics, the SIR model; the SIS model; and the Ross-Macdonald model, to incorporate either of two candidate movement models. We describe the effect that the choice of movement model has on each disease model's results, finding that in all cases there are parameter regimes where choosing one movement model instead of another has a profound impact on epidemiological outcomes. We further demonstrate the importance of choosing an appropriate movement model using the applied case of malaria transmission and importation on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, finding that one model produces intelligible predictions of R 0 while the other produces nonsensical results.",

In each of these cases, long-distance travel of infected human hosts proved to be an important driver of the spread of infectious disease between geographically separated populations.",

One consideration is finding a statistical model that fits adequately well to the data, predicting the frequency of travel or flow volume between two locations. There are already many candidate movement kernel models, such as gravity and radiation models, which have been evaluated against data in a variety of different settings (13, 18, (20) (21) (22) .

Two example classes of movement models which provide simple mechanistic representations of travel behavior are Eulerian movement models, which specify the rates at which hosts at one location travel to any other location, or Lagrangian movement models, which specify how frequently hosts travel away from home before returning (23) . Depending on the level of detail contained in the available data, one might be able to fit any number of candidate mechanistic movement models. There is precedent in calibrating different movement models using the same travel data, only to find that the disease dynamics have changed as a result (9) . Moving beyond the question of how to best fit a statistical model to that data set, the question becomes whether choosing one mechanistic movement model over another can affect epidemiological outcomes, and whether there are certain settings or parameter regimes where one type of movement model may be more accurate and appropriate.",

We use three infectious disease transmission models-the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model; the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model; and the Ross-Macdonald model-which represent a suite of tools for modeling the transmission dynamics of a wide variety of pathogens. We adapt each of the disease transmission models to incorporate two mechanistic representations of movement: the first is an Eulerian movement model which we call the Flux model, and the second is a Lagrangian movement model which we call the Simple Trip model. We directly compare the Flux and Simple Trip models by setting parameters such that the total flux of travelers between each sub-population remains constant, thus emulating a case where one might have a single data set from which one could calibrate either movement model. We examine how disease model outcomes can change with different movement models for each transmission model. For all three transmission models, we find that the modeled quantities of interest relating to disease dynamics can differ dramatically depending on one's choice of movement model. We conclude by applying this analysis to a model of malaria transmission and importation on Bioko Island in Equatorial Guinea, and use intuition based on our prior analysis to frame our understanding for why the Flux model surprisingly fails to produce meaningful predictions of transmission intensity in that context.",

Figure 1 compares how the two SIR models with metapopulation movement behave in different parameter regimes. In all cases the outcomes are dramatically different, showing that SIR model predictions depend strongly on how host movement is represented in the metapopulation model. The two movement models do agree when transmission parameters are equal in both locations (\u03b21 = \u03b22), but there are large quantitative differences whenever there is some heterogeneity in the local transmission conditions across the different locations.",

For example, the larger residual population for the Simple Trip model, seen in the left hand column of Figure 1 , follows from a limit on the amount of time that residents of population one spend in the high-transmission location 2. Another difference between the Flux and the Simple Trip models is that hosts in the Flux model have no home residence and continue to move freely between populations after the outbreak ends. As a result, as the system reaches equilibrium after the epidemic the fractions of susceptibles become constant across all locations. In contrast with the Simple Trip model, the Flux model effectively erases any evidence that the transmission intensity differed between the two locations.",

The Simple Trip model endemic prevalence in Figure 2 A is suppressed compared to the Flux model endemic prevalence because the amount of time that travelers from location 1 spend at risk in the high transmission location 2 is constrained to be small. Similarly, the Simple Trip model endemic prevalence in 2 B is elevated because travelers spend less of their time at risk in the low transmission location 2. In the long travel duration regime (Figure 2, lower row) , however, if the trip time is longer than the disease infectious period there is more time for prevalence among travelers to location 2 to equilibrate with the prevalence among residents of location 2: in this parameter regime, the Flux model and Simple trip models converge, because the constraint on time spent away from home makes less of a difference.",

Bioko Island is located in the Atlantic Ocean about 225km to the northwest of mainland Equatorial Guinea (EG) in Western Africa. From population data collected during a bednet mass-distribution campaign in 2018, human population count was 239,159 people, about 85% of whom lived in EG's capital city Malabo in the north (29) . During this sanitary census, however, there was a 12% absenteeism that needs to be accounted for. Following the recent efforts of an intensive malaria control and elimination program (Bioko Island Malaria Elimination Program, BIMEP), the average malaria parasite rate (PR, a measure of prevalence) in chhildren 2-14 years old has fallen from an average of 0.43 to 0.11 between 2004 and 2016, with further progress appearing to have stagnated in recent years since 2015 (30) . A recent analysis of data collected through malaria indicator surveys (MIS) (31-33) has used geostatistical techniques (34) to map the estimated prevalence of malaria (Figure 4 A) and the estimated probability of a resident leaving (Figure 4 B) across different locations on Bioko Island (14) . The analysis showed an elevated risk of infection among people who reported traveling recently (14) , a pattern corroborated by other studies (30, 35) . In particular, this suggests that travelers who had spent time in mainland EG, which still has an estimated mean prevalence of around 0.43 (36, 37) , are very likely to bring back infections with them that would contribute to the sustained endemic prevalence measured on Bioko Island. We can use the Ross-Macdonald model to infer local transmission intensity (R0) based on the known prevalence and travel behavior. We treat each of the pixels shown in the maps in Figure 4 as its own sub-population with its own local transmission environment, which allows the model to contain the spatial heterogeneity known from the data. We the population data to set the population Ni and the geospatial estimates to set prevalence Xi/Ni at each location. For the travel parameters we use trip destinations reported in the MIS (38) to fit a multinomial probability model of destination choice. Together with the travel frequency data (Figure 4 B) , we find a set of travel frequency parameters {\u03c6 i,k }, illustrated in Figure 4 C. We use MIS data on trip duration (38) to fit an exponential model of trip duration and find that travel within Bioko Island and to mainland equatorial had a mean duration of \u03c4 \u22121 i,BI = 21.2 and \u03c4 \u22121 i,EG = 10.3 days, respectively.

Figure 5 A maps estimates of R 0,Flux calculated using the Flux model (Eq. 14). The dark pixels of the map represent areas where the R 0,Flux estimates are calculated to be less than 0. In these locations, the rate at which people become infected while traveling and return home with malaria infections is too high for the transmission model to reconcile local transmission intensity with local prevalence. We frame our understanding of these results in terms of the K = 2 sub-population example discussed previously for the Ross-Macdonald Model. Each sub-population on Bioko Island exists in a parameter regime where travel duration is short (\u03c4i,j > r) and the prevalence in the off-island travel destination is higher than the local prevalence. We recall the results shown in Figure 3 A, where we see how for low prevalence values the Flux model tends to underestimate R0 compared to the Simple Trip model. The Simple Trip model constrains the amount of time that travelers spend on mainland EG, and therefore reduces the number of people who return home from traveling with malaria infections. The Flux model does not include such a constraint, and in this parameter regime we see how in some locations the rate of imported infections is too high and forces the transmission intensity to be negative.",

The full impact of the choice of movement model became clear from the example of modeling malaria transmission and importation on Bioko Island: We calibrated each of the two movement models using the same data set and found that each movement model produced dramatically different results. The Flux model predicted R0 < 0, which has no meaningful interpretation beyond the Flux model being inconsistent with the data used to calibrate it. The Simple Trip model, by specifying the rate at which travelers return home, adds a constraint on the amount of time that travelers spend while away from home. As a consequence, when combined with a the Simple Trip model constrains the amount of risk experienced by travelers. The Flux model has no such constraint: as long as there are variations in the transmission intensity across different locations there will be significant differences between the two movement models' results.",

In some applications, as with the Bioko Island example, the purpose of the model is to infer transmission conditions which may be difficult to measure empirically based on more readily available prevalence or incidence measures. Returning to Figure 2 A, we can imagine trying to determine the transmission intensity \u03b21 based on a measured prevalence of 0.25. From the Flux model we infer \u03b21 < 1, which suggests that local transmission risk is low. From the Simple Trip model, however, we infer \u03b21 > 1, which suggests the opposite. A similar inconsistency is illustrated for the Ross-Macdonald model in Figure 3 , and appears again in the Bioko Island example in Figure 5 .",

Often, for the sake of preserving subscriber privacy, CDRs are aggregated across individual users, time, and geographical area before becoming public. That is to say, publicly available CDR data sets count the number of mobile phones traveling from one service tower catchment area to another on a daily or weekly basis: these data sets do not record an individual's rate of leaving home or time spent while traveling away from home. The loss of individual identity from data sets has already been shown to impact the predicted outcome of disease models in other contexts (9) . While the limits and biases inherent to CDR data sets have been well-documented (39), the present study suggests an additional drawback when it comes to using CDR data sets for epidemiological modeling: because it is not clear that a Flux model is sufficient to produce accurate modeling results in some contexts, it is likewise not clear that flux data are sufficient to quantify travel behavior when building a movement model. This is not to say that CDR data or Flux models are useless, only that one needs to carefully consider the epidemiological context before incorporating a Flux model into a disease transmission model.",

In theory, one may imagine similarly comparing more detailed and complicated movement models, such as incorporating travel behavior with multiple stops; adding stochastic effects; or using agent-based models to incorporate movement behavior heterogeneity among the travelers. It remains to be seen the extent to which such additional model features might further affect the epidemiological outcomes of interest. In practice, however, the data required for calibrating such models may not be readily available, and using a Flux or Simple Trip description of travel behavior may be more practical. Even for such simple movement models there is a risk of misusing the travel data that are available to calibrate a movement model which cannot be reconciled with the data and produces outputs that are difficult or impossible to interpret.",
