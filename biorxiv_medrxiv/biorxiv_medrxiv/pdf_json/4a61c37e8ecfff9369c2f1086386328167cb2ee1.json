Here, we 12 investigate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the host protein bound by SARS-CoV and 13 SARS-CoV-2. We find that the ACE2 gene is under strong selection pressure in bats, the group 14 in which the progenitors of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are hypothesized to have evolved, 15 particularly in residues that contact SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We detect positive selection 16 in non-bat mammals in ACE2 but in a smaller proportion of branches than in bats, without 17 enrichment of selection in residues that contact SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we 18 evaluate similarity between humans and other species in residues that contact SARS-CoV or 19 SARS-CoV-2, revealing potential susceptible species but also highlighting the difficulties of 20 predicting spillover events. This work increases our understanding of the relationship between 21 mammals, particularly bats, and coronaviruses, and provides data that can be used in functional 22 studies of how host proteins are bound by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains. 23 24 Main: 25 The recent coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the disastrous impacts of zoonotic 26 spillovers and underscores the need to understand how pathogens and hosts evolve in 27 response to one another. Evolutionary analyses of host proteins targeted by infections reveal 28 the pressures that hosts have faced from pathogens and how they have evolved to resist 29 disease, informing predictions about spread of infections and how to counter them. The virus, 30 SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19, like its close relative SARS-CoV, is thought to 31 have its progenitor origins in bats 1-3 .

Many ACE2 residues that interact with HCoV-NL63 155 also interact with one or both of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 23,24 , which may be driving the 156 evidence of selection in these residues. However, we did find evidence of selection in residues 157 321 and 326 in both bats and non-bat mammals (Table S2 , 5 trees, MEME, p < 0.05), as well as 158 selection in bats in residue 322 (Table S2 , 5 trees, MEME, p < 0.05); these three residues 159 contact HCoV-NL63 but not SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. Our finding of selection in residues 160 that contact HCoV-NL63 but not SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 contrasts with the findings of a 161 smaller dataset of bats mostly from Europe, Asia and Africa 7 and may result from our greater 162 power to detect signal or signal originating from bats in different regions than previously tested. 163 author/funder.

Compatibility of 235 the host protease with the virus is important for determining host range 9 and viral strains vary in 236 their binding properties to different species 15 , with some SARS-like coronaviruses able to bind 237 human, civet and rhinolophid ACE2, despite major ACE2 sequence differences between the 238 species 20 . Additionally, SARS-CoV can enter cells expressing the ACE2 of Myotis daubentonii 239and Rhinolophus sinicus with limited efficiency 6 , even though these species only share 13-16 240 amino acids with humans that contact either virus and each contain some mutations that should 241 author/funder.
