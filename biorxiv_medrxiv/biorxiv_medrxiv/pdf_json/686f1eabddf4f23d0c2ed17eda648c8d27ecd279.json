Here we propose a tailored dynamic model accounting for community-specific transmission controls and medical resource availability. We trained the model using data from Wuhan and applied it to other countries. We show that isolating suspected cases is most effective in reducing transmission rate if the intervention starts early. Having more hospital beds provides leverage that diminishes with delayed intervention onset. The importance of transmission control in turn increases by 65% with a 7-day delay. Furthermore, prolonging outbreak duration by applying an intermediate, rather than strict, transmission control would not prevent hospital overload regardless of bed capacity, and would likely result in a high ratio (21% ~ 84%) of the population being infected but not treated. The model could help different countries design control policies and gauge the severity of suppression failure.",

The two measurements showed the same steep jump in value, indicating suppression failure ( Figure 4A , B, D&E). This jump was well captured by the suppression threshold derived from the daily reproduction number (the blue curves in respective panels). Compared to the hospital capacity in US, the high hospital bed capacity in Germany would yield a higher threshold for suppression ( Figure 4C , relative \u2206\u03b2 = 0.10). But such an advantage would be greatly reduced if interventions were delayed by a week ( Figure 4F , relative \u2206\u03b2 = 0.065). By regressing the threshold-level relative on the log-transformed number of beds per 1,000 population for a range of intervention onsets ( Figure 5A ), we found that hospital bed capacity would play the most important role with the intervention onset 2 days later than Wuhan. But having an advantage in hospital bed capacity would be less relevant if the onset was further delayed ( Figure 5B ). Specifically, the relative utility of transmission control in relation to bed capacity would be increased by 64.9% with a 7-day onset delay (slope shifted from 9.50 to 5.76).",

Serving as a buffer between the symptomatic cohort and the confirmed cohort, Wuhan's strategy bought extra time for the culmination of medical resources in all departments, including extra-provincial medical staff dispatch, test kit production and new hospital construction. Our model showed that such a strategy in Wuhan was implemented soon enough (6 days until the advantage diminished) to provide a relieved NPI strength required for suppression. Moreover, proactive isolation in Wuhan was also beneficial in reducing peak hospital bed occupancy (from 44,000 to 40,710). As long as the transmission control had been strong enough, such positive outcomes would have been warranted regardless of the timing of NPI.

However, our simulation proved this strategy to be flawed regarding COVID-19 ( Figure 4 ). Successful suppressions are featured by greatly reduced outbreak size and duration. In contrast, prolonged outbreak durations indicate inadequate transmission control, in which case healthcare system overload is unavoidable ( Figure 4C&F ). Consequently, the number of untreated infections (and thus the death toll) would outgrow that of the treated by orders of magnitude ( Figure 4F ). Either consequence would be in violation of the goals behind the \"flattening the curve\" strategy. A similar conclusion has been drawn 11 The timing for lifting control policies and the potential for a rebound in transmission thereafter were not explicitly investigated in this study. Under a given situation of successful suppression where the majority of the population was not infected, herd immunity would have to be established by population-wide vaccination 11, 17 . Until an effective vaccine is developed, a partial relaxation of transmission control policies while maintaining suppression would nonetheless be potentially achievable by ensuring a close monitoring of the daily reproduction number.

At the beginning of an outbreak when every individual is susceptible, the basic reproduction number 0 can by calculated from Equation (12), given that the asymptomatic cases are not infectious. With the current model specifying timedependent parameters and 50% asymptomatic transmissibility, the average time of contact for the symptomatic and asymptomatic cohort is computed respectively in Equation (13) and Equation (14) . A daily reproduction number is then computed as in Equation (17) . Whether the average daily production numbers during healthcare system overload is below 1 is the criterion for successful suppression.

Nonetheless, if suppression is not achievable, the results still favor implementing as strict as possible transmission controls, since giving up transmission control in total would only further increase the number of untreated patients. Instead of the explicit number of deaths from either untreated or treated patients, we paid attention to the number of infected patients that went untreated. In fact, this cohort could not be directly documented and thus are not directly reflected in the case numbers reported by countries. However, the significance of estimating those numbers became evident, as the simulation suggested that when suppression failed, the majority of the patients would be deprived of a chance at treatment (Figure 4 C&F). The exact mortality rate of COIVID-19 has been shown to be decided heavily by factors including patient age and pre-existing conditions 6,13-15 , and the contributions of these factors are still under much debate. Nonetheless, such measure helps demonstrate a crucial aspect of the pandemic's impact on public health. It is mostly decided by NPI, regardless of the community-specific factors including demographic constituents and healthcare system preparedness 11,16 (e.g. intensive care unit space and equipment availability) that would impact death toll as well as average patient prognosis.",
