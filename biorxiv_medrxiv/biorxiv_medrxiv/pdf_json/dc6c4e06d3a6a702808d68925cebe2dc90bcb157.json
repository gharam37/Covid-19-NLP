            "text": "About one month after the COVID-19 epidemic peaked in Mainland China and SARS-CoV-2 migrated to Europe and then the U.S., the epidemiological data begin to provide important insights into the risks associated with the disease and the effectiveness of intervention strategies such as travel restrictions and lockdowns (\"social distancing\"). Respiratory diseases, including the 2003 SARS epidemic, remain only about two months in any given population, although peak incidence and lethality can vary. The epidemiological data suggest that at least two strains of the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 virus have evolved during its migration from Mainland China to Europe. South Korea, Iran, Italy, and Italy's neighbors were hit by the more dangerous \"SKII\" variant. While the epidemic in continental Asia is about to end, and in Europe about to level off, the more recent epidemic in the younger US population is still increasing, albeit not exponentially anymore. The peak level will likely depend on which of the strains has entered the U.S. first. The same models that help us to understand the epidemic also help us to choose prevention strategies. Containment of high-risk people, like the elderly, and reducing disease severity, either by vaccination or by early treatment of complications, is the best strategy against a respiratory virus disease. Lockdowns can be effective during the month following the peak incidence in infections, when the exponential increase of cases ends. Earlier containment of low-risk people merely prolongs the time the virus needs to circulate until the incidence is high enough to initiate \"herd immunity\". Later containment is not helpful, unless to prevent a rebound if containment started too early.",

The period is shorter for smaller more homogenous and longer for larger, more heterogenous populations. For a given infectious period 1/\u03b3 (here, e.g., 7 days. SARS and COVID-19 incubation period plus 2 days (Lauer 2020) ), R0 also determines how long it will take for early cases to become visible after a single import (150-60 days), the peak prevalence of infections (5-22%), and how many people will become immune (55-90%).

Given the fast rise in number of cases in NYC turning on 03-22 (Fig 10c) , which was also observed in Detroit, Chicago, and Dallas, see [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/27/upshot/coronavirus-new-york-comparison.html , accessed 04-03] ), an intervention at 03-22 started at the turning point (Fig 13) .

While Italy has many people 65 years and older (23%, second only to Japan data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.65UP.TO.ZS ), the relatively small differences or age distribution within Europe (e.g., Germany: 21%) are unlikely to account for much of this difference.

For instance, during much of the HIV epidemic, there was widespread fear that HIV could establish itself in the population as a whole, even though the data (including data showing absence of transmission to the wives of hemophiliacs) (Wittkowski 1995a) and models (Wittkowski 1992; Seydel 1994) contradicted this fear. (Wittkowski 1995b; 1996) These results have been repeatedly confirmed. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019; Haddad 2019) In the case of heterosexual transmission of HIV one could argue that there was little risk associated with a the public health policy promoting condom use, but in the case of COVID-19 prevention, ignoring models and data may carry substantial risk.",

Only if stopping the epidemic from generating a sufficient number of immune people is avoided can containment efforts stop after about a month or two (depending on late or early start, respectively), when the ratio of infectious vs immune people is low enough for preventing the disease from rebounding.
