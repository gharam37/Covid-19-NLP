As the virus infected cases and mortality rate of this disease is increasing exponentially, scientists and researchers all over the world are relentlessly working to understand this new virus along with possible treatment regimens by discovering active therapeutic agents and vaccines. So, there is an urgent requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The research includes the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate clinical recovery, in other words repurposing of existing drugs. The vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time.",

Consequently, a detailed study using ML for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required. Here, we report the ML model based on the Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm, which has an accuracy of around 73% to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study predicts around ten FDA approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing. Among all, we suggest that the antiretroviral drug Saquinavir (DrugBank ID -DB01232) would probably be one of the most effective drugs based on the selected criterions. Our study can help clinical scientists in being more selective in identifying and testing the therapeutic agents for COVID-19 treatment. The ML based approach for drug discovery as reported here can be a futuristic smart drug designing strategy for community applications.",

Coronaviruses belong to a family of viruses mainly found in animals but with the recent outbreak, they have transmitted to humans. The new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV is termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] which has now affected more than 200 countries with over 12,18,991 cases confirmed and 65,878 deaths reported all over the world [as on 05 April 2020]. This could potentially bring major challenges to global healthcare and disastrous effect on the global economy if the virus is not contained within a few months 10 . The common symptoms include cough, fever, shortness of breath, fatigue etc which makes it confusing for the patients to differentiate the symptoms with that of the typical cold and flu [10] [11] [12] [13] . Reports suggest that the virus is transmitted through body fluids of the infected patients, especially when in contact and while sneezing even though exact reasons are not known.",

The False Positive Rate is the ratio of the predicted false actives to actual inactives and this can be obtained as (FP/TN+FP). Accuracy shows the model's performance relative to the real values and this can be calculated as (TN+TP/TN+TP+FP+FN). The Sensitivity shows the model's ability to identify the positive results and this is calculated as (TP/FN+TP) and the Specificity shows the model's ability to identify the negative results and this is calculated as (TN/TN+FP). A model with high specificity and sensitivity has a low error rate. The Balanced Classification Rate (BCR) is the mean of the sensitivity and specificity, which provides the accuracy of the model applied on the imbalanced dataset.

These spikes adheres onto human cells, through certain receptors on target cells, after which undergoes a structural change that lets the viral membrane fuse with the cell membrane. The viral genes then enter the host cell, producing more viruses. Recent studies show that, like the virus responsible for 2002 SARS outbreak,",

The comparison of the False Positive Rate and True Positive Rate for all algorithms used in the case of preparation of ML models are shown in Figure 2.

The model created with Naive Bayes algorithm predicted around 471 drugs out of all the 2388 approved drugs. These 471 drugs contain all the drugs which may be for the treatment of disease caused by SARS coronavirus-19.
