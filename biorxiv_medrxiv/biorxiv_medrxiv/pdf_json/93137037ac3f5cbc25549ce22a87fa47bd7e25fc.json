We statistically analyze the epidemic data from February 24 to March 30, 2020 in Italy, and proposes a simple time series analysis model based on the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). The cumulative number of newly diagnosed and newly diagnosed patients in Italy is preprocessed and can be used to predict the spread of the Italian COVID-19 epidemic. The conclusion is that an inflection point is expected to occur in Italy in early April, and some reliable points are put forward for the inflection point of the epidemic: strengthen regional isolation and protection, do a good job of personal hygiene, and quickly treat the team leaders existing medical forces. It is hoped that the \"City Closure\" decree issued by the Italian government will go in the right direction, because this is the only way to curb the epidemic.",

At present, the proliferation trend has been contained in China, and to prevent foreign import is the key point to evaluate whether we achieve the final success. However, Italy, which located in Europe, is in a serious stage of epidemic spread. Fundamentally, due to the long incubation period of the virus, the difficulty in identifying symptoms, negligence in the prevention and control of returnees, and the relatively low number of sick people, Italy and the whole of Europe have not been highly vigilant, which has brought an opportunity for the spread of the virus [1] .",

Reference [2] based on the SEIR kinetic model, taking into account the propagation mechanism, infection rate, and isolation measures of COVID-19, established a SEIR +CAQ propagation kinetic model, which can be used to predict the trend of COVID-19 in China, and to provide epidemic prevention and help with decision making. Reference [3] used the least square method of SEIR partitioning and Poisson noise to estimate the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Japan as R0 = 2.6 (95% CI, 2.4-2.8). The experimental results show that the epidemic of COVID-19 in Japan will not end quickly, and it is ridiculous to think that COVID-19 will disappear in summer spontaneously. The traditional epidemic model (SEIR) involves various factors and analyses, which may subject to potential bias. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a COVID-19 prediction model based on time series. Reference [4] proposed the ARIMA model that is useful to predict the spread of COVID-19, and then continuously improved the model by updating the data set. The experimental results show that it has good consistency with the actual epidemic spread.",
