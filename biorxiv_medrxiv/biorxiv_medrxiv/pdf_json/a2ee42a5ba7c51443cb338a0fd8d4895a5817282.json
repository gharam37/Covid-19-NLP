However, pool testing is typically performed via an adaptive testing strategy which requires a feedback loop in the lab and at least two PCR runs to confirm positive results. This can cost precious time. We discuss a non-adaptive testing method where each sample is distributed in a prescribed manner over several pools, and which yields reliable results after one round of testing. More precisely, assuming knowledge about the overall infection incidence rate, we calculate explicit error bounds on the number of false positives which scale very favourably with pool size and sample multiplicity. This allows for hugely streamlined PCR testing and cuts in detection times for a large-scale testing scenario. A viable consequence of this method could be real-time screening of entire communities, frontline healthcare workers and international flight passengers, for example, using the PCR machines currently in operation.",

Pooled testing was pioneered by Dorfman in 1943 [Dor43] and led to a host of research activity, both on the lab side as well as the theoretical side [AJS19, DH99, DH06] . If the infection is rare in the population, then pooled testing may be advisable. In this case it can assist in optimizing precious testing capacity since most individual results would be negative. Pooling relies on the fact that the PCR is reasonably reliable under the combination of samples: the preprint [YAST + 20] suggests that a detection of COVID-19 in pools of size 32 and possibly 64 is feasible.",

If samples are tested in pools of size n and the incidence of the infection \u03c1 is small (more precisely, if \u03c1 \u00b7 n is small) then in average 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c1) n = n\u03c1 \u2212 n 2 \u03c1 2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2248 n\u03c1 (remember that \u03c1 \u00b7 n is small) of pools will be positive and hence a portion n \u00b7 \u03c1 of individuals need to undergo a second test. In other words, pooled testing with individual verification of positive pools is an adaptive testing strategy, the lab organisation for which is a labour, management, and resource intensive process. It has several drawbacks, since it requires keeping multiple lab samples and rerunning of the time-intensive PCR process. The lab feedback loop makes the entire workflow more susceptible to delays (see Figure 2 ). This may result in delays in individual results -a particular problem when the objective is to rapidly identify infected individuals, who may infect others while waiting for the test outcome. Furthermore, since the number of samples selected for a second round of testing is a random quantity, some reserve capacity is required to prevent further delays. This makes it more challenging for the lab to operate near its maximal capacity.",
