            "text": "Currently, the widely used method of SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical diagnostics is an RT-qPCR assay, detecting the presence of viral RNA in patient samples. Although RT-qPCR is widely implemented for the detection of pathogens, including viruses [3] in clinical samples, the implementation of the specific assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 has only recently been established. The currently used protocol was developed and optimized for the detection of the novel coronavirus at the Charit\u00e9 University Hospital, in collaboration with several other laboratories in Germany, the Netherlands, China, France, UK and Belgium [4] . Additionally, the existing protocol was further optimized by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States through the comprehensive comparison and validation of alternative available kits for nucleic acid extraction and the use of alternative probe and primer sets for efficient SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical samples [5] [6] . Routinely, the application of qPCR for the relative quantification of a transcript of interest in a sample, is preceded by a) the isolation of total RNA from the sample and b) the use of purified RNA in a reverse-transcription (RT) reaction resulting in complementary DNA (cDNA) from the template RNA, which is then utilized for the qPCR reaction. However, nucleic acid purification and RT of the resulting RNA into cDNA are not only laborious and time-consuming, but the additional steps requiring manual handling can result in experimental errors. In the case of clinical sampling and diagnostics, the use of a single-reaction kit combining the RT and qPCR reactions (such as the TaqPath 1-step RT-qPCR) is therefore customary. Although the single-step RT-qPCR removes the need for a separate RT reaction, RNA isolation from clinical samples constitutes a significant chokepoint in the diagnostic process, as it remains both manually laborious and expensive. Specifically, both the Charit\u00e9 University Hospital and the CDC protocols require the use of RNA purification kits, which not only results in a significant cost increase but has already led to a major supply shortage of such kits. It is therefore crucial that a new test is not only affordable, quick and efficient, but that it keeps the use of industrial kits to the minimum. Recent attempts have been made to circumvent RNA extraction in COVID-19 detection [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

In addition, we provide data showing that SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR can be performed in presence of high concentration of detergent, allowing testing directly on sample lysates.

To do this, we spiked synthetic full-genome SARS-CoV-2 RNA (SKU102024-MN908947.3, Twist Biosciences) into dilution series of three different transport media (Virocult MED-MW951S, Sigma; Transwab MW176S, Sigma, and Eswab 482C, COPAN) used for clinical sampling at the time of the study (Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden). Each mock sample contained 50,000 synthetic SARS-CoV-2 gRNA copies and 95-0.1% medium, corresponding to 47.5-0.05% medium in the RT-qPCR reaction. We performed single-reaction RT-qPCR using 10\u00b5l sample in a 20\u00b5l TaqPath reaction and the CDC nucleocapsid 1 (N1) primer-probe set ( Table 1 , Methods) and recorded cycle threshold (C T) values for the dilution series of the media. We observed inhibitory effects in all three media and, importantly, pronounced variation between media (Fig. 2a-d) . Virocult and Transwab demonstrated similar profiles of inhibition, resulting in +2-3 CT at the highest medium concentrations ( Fig. 2a-b) and minimal inhibition at concentrations below 30% medium in the RT-qPCR reaction. Eswab completely impeded detection at high concentrations but reached a similarly low level of inhibition as Virocult and Transwab at 25% concentration in the reaction. For RT experiments relying on synthetic RNA, it is vital to exclude the possibility of lingering DNA template molecules. Therefore, we additionally performed RT and qPCR reactions in two separate steps (Methods) including RT+/-controls, which demonstrated the lack of DNA amplification signal when the reverse transcriptase was eliminated from the reaction (Supplementary Fig.  1a) . Together, these results indicate minimal or no inhibition of Virocult, Transwab and Eswab at \u226425% in the RT-qPCR reaction, corresponding to \u22645\u00b5l sample in a 20\u00b5l SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR reaction.",

Aliquots of the same samples had previously been clinically diagnosed using conventional RNA extraction (MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral NA SV Kit, Roche Diagnostics 06543588001) followed by RT-qPCR, calling three patient samples as SARS-CoV-2 positive and two as negative to the virus (Clinical diagnostics performed at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm). We inactivated the nasopharyngeal samples either by adding MagNA Pure 96 External Lysis Buffer (Roche, 06374913001), used in conventional RNA purification, or by heating at 65\u00b0C for 30 min, and performed RT-qPCR using 3\u00b5l of sample. We observed a lack of amplification in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples inactivated with External Lysis Buffer ( Fig. 2e-f and Supplementary Fig. 1b) . However, RT-qPCR performed directly on heatinactivated samples correctly detected SARS-CoV-2 in all positive samples and lacked signal in the negative samples and controls ( Fig. 2e-f ). This indicated the viability in further exploring heat-inactivated direct RT-qPCR (hid-RT-qPCR) as a method to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. We also tested two-step RT and qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection on the same clinical samples (Methods), correctly detecting the viral presence and absence (Supplementary Fig. 1c ).",

We observed, in our setting, a modest difference between N1 and RdRP in hid-RT-qPCR (mean and median CT difference to N1: 0.63 and 0.27, P=0.032, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) while the E-gene set appeared at considerably higher CT values than the other primerprobe sets (mean and median CT difference to N1: 2.9 and 1.7, P=0.00098, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) ( Fig.  2g-h) . Lower performance of primers and probes targeting the E gene is in line with previous results [7, 11] . We argue that short amplicon targets are optimal for heat-inactivated samples, while considerations on the amplicon length could be less important for PCR amplification performed on extracted RNA from fresh samples (See Discussion). Due to the superior performance of N1 and RdRP in hid-RT-qPCR we focused on these primers in all further analyses.",

However, clinical samples contain additional material from the swab and other unknown and potentially inhibitory agents. In addition, due to potentially large variability between clinical samples, it is important to characterize inhibition curves in multiple individual clinical samples rather than an averaged mix of samples. The optimal amount of sample input in hid-RT-qPCR should be a balance between possible inhibition from the sample and the amount of RNA going into the reaction. To identify the optimal range of sample input in clinical samples, we performed dilution series (10 to 0.01\u03bcl) of individual COVID-19 positive heat-inactivated (65\u00b0C, 30 min) nasopharyngeal swab samples, and found an input of 4-1\u03bcl sample in a 20\u03bcl TaqPath RT-qPCR to be optimal, avoiding the sharp inhibitory effect at higher amounts of sample input observed in some individual samples, yet minimizing C T (Fig. 2i-j) .",

For all samples, we used 4\u03bcl input and primers N1, RdRP, as well as RNase P for assessment of sample RNA integrity. Thereafter, we combined the results of hid-RT-qPCR with CT values from the clinical diagnostics performed on extracted RNA (MagNA Pure 96, Roche Diagnostics, test targeting E and RdRP) (Fig.  3) . We observed strong correlation between CT values of extracted and heat-inactivated samples (Fig. 3a) . CT values for hid-RT-qPCR samples were higher than for RNA eluates of the same samples (median 6.7 Ct difference) (Fig. 3b) . This was expected given that (1) More RNA was loaded for eluates (2.5x, standard 10\u03bcl input vs. 4\u03bcl volume equivalent in hid-RT-qPCR), (2) RNA extraction of eluates was performed on fresh samples while the aliquots used for hid-RT-qPCR had been frozen and stored at -20\u00b0C, and then thawed before heat inactivation, (3) Heating may degrade RNA in presence of RNases and/or metal ions (metal-ionbased RNA cleavage), and (4) Inhibitory agents from the swab and medium may inhibit RT-qPCR, although significant medium inhibition is unlikely (Fig. 2d,i-j) . By performing RNA re-extraction from 19 freeze-thawed aliquots and comparing C T values to eluates of matched fresh samples we found the effect of freezethaw to result in +2-3 CT (Fig. 3b) . However, difference in CT value is not the same as difference in diagnostic outcome (i.e. detected presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2). We plotted a heatmap of CT values (Fig. 3c) and found a striking agreement between clinical diagnostics performed on RNA eluates and hid-RT-qPCR COVID-19 calls. Absent-or-present calls in qPCR analysis is dependent on the arbitrary cycle-number cut-off applied, and high cut-off may be valid especially if the PCR efficiency is expected to be low in individual samples. On the other hand, only one of the positive samples in hid-RT-qPCR had a detected SARS-CoV-2 amplification recorded with CT above 40 (Fig. 3c , sample 63). Notably, using diagnostic of extracted RNA and best-performing target RdRP as reference, hid-RT-qPCR using primer-probe set N1 showed an accuracy of 92% (95% confidence interval [CI95%]: 84-97%, P= 1.6 x 10 -15 , binominal test; 91% sensitivity; 93% specificity) ( Table 2) . Among the 85 cases, hid-RT-qPCR using N1 + RdRP missed three COVID-19 positive samples that were detected by routine diagnostics on RNA eluates targeting genes E + RdRP.

SARS coronavirus capsids are self-assembled particles in which the lipid bilayer is a weak spot [12], thus the viral capsid can be ruptured by surfactants and at the same time viral RNA can be released from similarly lysed human cells in the sample [13] . RT-qPCR assays directly on detergent-inactivated samples would require an RT-qPCR assay resilient to high concentrations of detergent. We determined the effect of Triton-X100 and Tween-20, on SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR, using a spike-in of 50,000 copies synthetic full-genome SARS-CoV-2 RNA (SKU102024-MN908947.3, Twist Biosciences) and the N1 primerprobe set. We found that C T values were only modestly affected (+1-2 CT) when incubated with as much as 5% Triton X-100 or 10% Tween-20 in the RT-qPCR reaction ( Fig. 4a-b ). We observed a lowered level of fluorescence in the plateau phase in qPCR at increased concentrations of detergent, without markedly affecting the CT (Fig. 4c-d) . As a step to test whether SARS-CoV-2 could be detected after direct lysis, we obtained six aliquots of saliva and six combined nose and throat swabs in PBS from six deidentified donors (Methods), of which four had been identified as COVID-19 positive and two as negative in extractionbased routine diagnostics (sample aliquots obtained from the Public Health Agency of Sweden, Folkh\u00e4lsomyndigheten). Notably, these samples were not collected by health care professionals using clinical grade flocked plastic swabs, rather the samples were self-collected using simple cotton swabs (deposition in PBS) and a jar without storage buffer for saliva (Methods). Furthermore, at the time of our experiment, these samples had been freeze-thawed and stored at room temperature for several hours combined. We tested these samples blindly, by mixing 5\u03bcl sample (saliva or nose + throat swab) with 5\u03bcl of 10 or 20% Triton X-100 and performing the SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR using the N1 primers and probe directly on these lysates. Indeed, all four COVID-19 positive donor individuals were correctly called as SARS-CoV-2 positive in at least one Triton X-100 condition or sample (saliva and/or nose + throat swab), while negative controls lacked signal (Fig. 4e) .",

            "text": "In blind testing of 85 clinical samples, we found that hid-RT-qPCR and the CDC N1 primer-probe-set largely agreed with conventional extraction-based diagnostics targeting SARS-CoV-2 genes E and RdRP ( Fig. 3c and Table 2 ). That C T values from hid-RT-qPCR overall were inferior (higher) compared to conventional extraction-based RT-qPCR detection however suggest a lower analytical sensitivity of the hid-RT-qPCR method. To further improve the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 hid-RT-qPCR, the heatinactivation procedure should promptly be optimized to maximize the RNA integrity of the sample while effectively inactivating the virus. We and others [10] found that brief inactivation at high temperature (95\u00b0C) provided higher SARS-CoV-2 RNA yield compared to longer heat-inactivation at lower temperature. In addition, we suggest that by adding the chelator EDTA before heating, metal-ion-based RNA cleavage during heating could be reduced. Supplement of MgCl 2 in the RT-qPCR reaction may then compensate for lowered available Mg 2+ , needed for reverse transcription. Moreover, the medium could be buffered to lowered pH to better preserve the phosphodiester bond of RNA during heating, and, chemical (heat resistant) RNAse inhibitors may further increase sensitivity in hid-RT-qPCR. In addition to being heat resistant, readily available chemical RNase inhibitors are cheap, making them suitable for scaled diagnostics (although their effect on RT-qPCR need to be characterized). We and others should combine our efforts to identify the optimal heat-inactivation formula for SARS-CoV-2 hid-RT-qPCR.",

Such lysed samples could be taken immediately to RT-qPCR analysis and diluted in the RT-qPCR master mix without intervening steps. Although the data is limited and the procedure needs to be refined, our results on saliva and nose/throat samples using cotton swabs (Fig. 4e) suggest that this strategy is workable. If the sensitivity ultimately proves to be adequate for meaningful decisions on self-isolation to limit spread, then this method could be applied to samples taken by the test-subjects themselves, opening a path to massive screening of the population. (Fig. 4e) were self-collected samples from volunteer from a COVID-19 clinical screen performed in the Stockholm area, organized by the Public Health Agency of Sweden.
