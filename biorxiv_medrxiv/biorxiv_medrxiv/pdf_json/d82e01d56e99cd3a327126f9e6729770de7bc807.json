            "text": "Background: Metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) has enabled the rapid, unbiased detection and identification of microbes without pathogen-specific reagents, culturing, or a priori knowledge of the microbial landscape. mNGS data analysis requires a series of computationally intensive processing steps to accurately determine the microbial composition of a sample. Existing mNGS data analysis tools typically require bioinformatics expertise and access to local server-class hardware resources. For many research laboratories, this presents an obstacle, especially in resource limited environments. Findings: We present IDseq, an open source cloud-based metagenomics pipeline and service for global pathogen detection and monitoring (https://idseq.net). The IDseq Portal accepts raw mNGS data, performs host and quality filtration steps, then executes an assembly-based alignment pipeline which results in the assignment of reads and contigs to taxonomic categories. The taxonomic relative abundances are reported and visualized in an easy-to-use web application to facilitate data interpretation and hypothesis generation. Furthermore, IDseq supports environmental background model generation and automatic internal spike-in control recognition, providing statistics which are critical for data interpretation. IDseq was designed with the specific intent of detecting novel pathogens. Here, we benchmark novel virus detection capability using both synthetically evolved viral sequences, and real-world samples, including IDseq analysis of a nasopharyngeal swab sample acquired and processed locally in Cambodia from a tourist from Wuhan, China, infected with the recently emergent SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: The IDseq Portal reduces the barrier to entry for mNGS data analysis and enables bench scientists, clinicians, and bioinformaticians to gain insight from mNGS datasets for both known and novel pathogens.",

            "text": "Infectious diseases remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite significant advancement in our understanding of infectious disease biology, existing microbiological tests often fail to identify etiologic pathogens in cases of suspected infection. This can be due to a number of causes -failure to isolate an appropriate sample type, preemptive antibiotic exposure precluding growth in culture, lack of suspicion of a particular infection precluding the ordering of an appropriate test, or lack of available specific diagnostic tests due, in part, to limited knowledge of circulating pathogens. This is compounded further by the fact that novel, previously uncharacterized pathogens may also be present. This fact was illustrated vividly by the recent emergence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, in early December 2019. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of nucleic acid from biological samples offers the potential for a universal pathogen detection method, including the detection of novel species. mNGS has great potential as a broad spectrum surveillance or patient monitoring tool, especially in low and middle income countries where the infectious disease burden remains high [1] . While the expense of sequencing continues to drop, the challenge of mNGS data analysis, the lack of bioinformatics expertise, and the access to sufficient compute and storage remains a major obstacle. mNGS experiments result in millions of sequencing reads generated from the nucleic acid present within a biological sample, which may include complex microbial populations. A primary goal of mNGS data analysis is to determine what nucleic acid derives from the host (for example, a patient), and what cannot be attributed to the host or environmental contaminants. Further analysis of the non-host sequence may then attempt to determine the relative abundances of different taxa present in a particular sample, as this may provide insight into the presence and relevance of potentially pathogenic microbes. This is typically done via alignment of sequencing reads to a reference database. In the context of infectious diseases, identification of pathogens via this approach obviates the need for pathogen-specific reagents or the ability to culture the microbe. This is especially important for microbes that are difficult, or impossible to culture, including many viruses, fungal species, eukaryotic parasites, and bacteria [2] . Additional downstream analysis may then be employed to understand trends in the abundances and relatedness of organisms across samples.",

            "text": "There are several tools available for estimating relative abundance of microbial populations from mNGS data [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . However, running these tools requires bioinformatics expertise and fluency with command-line tools. Additionally, pathogen detection in the context of a host organism presents unique informatics challenges beyond microbial abundance estimation. As noted, a substantial fraction of the sample may consist of host sequences that are secondary to the goal of pathogen detection [21] . Existing tools do not perform sensitive removal of host sequences or quality control (QC) steps, thus requiring the use of separate QC and alignment tools, and therefore additional computational experience in pipelining. A number of tools exist to incorporate multiple pipeline steps alongside reporting capabilities, including OneCodex [22] , Sunbeam [23] , and SURPI [24] . However, these tools require paid subscription or significant computational resources to build the underlying databases and run the analyses. Consequently, existing tools are not sufficient to support new applications of mNGS in poorly host-agnostic and allows researchers to select from several available hosts including human, mouse, pig, ticks, and mosquito, among others. For example, human host samples are aligned to the HG38 reference database (GCA_000001405. 15 ), while mosquito samples are aligned to a combined collection of reference genomes from Culex and Aedes species as well as other diptera. Reads that align to the selected host genome are removed from the analysis. For hosts with well-annotated genomes, individual gene counts may be saved for offline transcriptome analysis, provided appropriate consent in the case of human subject research. Such host-based analyses have been shown to complement metagenomic analysis for pathogen detection [27] . For all host organisms, sequences for optional spike-in RNA controls developed by the External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCCs) are automatically recognized for downstream steps.",

Regardless of the host genome, the data is scoured to remove all remaining human sequences using Bowtie2 against the HG38 reference database [31] and gmap-gsnap against a more stringent database including sequences combining both HG38 and Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) [32] . This step is especially important in the case of vector research, where blood meals may contain human sequences. At each step, the total number of reads remaining in the analysis is computed and these basic QC metrics (including total non-host reads, % passing QC, and duplicate compression ratio) are provided both in the user interface, as well as via download.",

First, relevant QC metrics and pipeline run information, including the number of reads remaining at each step of the host and quality filtering steps as well as estimates of internal control abundances are provided for each sample (Figure 2AB, Methods) . The singlesample report tables provide key metrics for each taxon identified in the sample, including the total number of reads aligning to the taxon (in both NT and NR) as well as contig stats from the assembly-based alignment step ( Figure 2C) . The tree view enables rapid assessment of taxonomic relatedness of microbes identified in the sample ( Figure 2D ). For all views of the data, a wide range of user-selectable compound query and filtering tools are made available, enabling facile investigation of the data. For each taxonomic category, IDseq also provides oneclick downloads of the corresponding underlying reads and contigs. Furthermore, coverage plots for contigs relative to all corresponding accessions to which they map are automatically generated ( Figure 2F ). To assist with distinguishing microbial signal from reagent and environmental contamination, IDseq supports background model generation, which allows researchers to evaluate the significance (reported in z-scores) of relative abundance estimates for taxons in samples of interest as compared to water-only or other environmental control sample collections.

For example, addition of a minimum alignment length filter to improve specificity of NT alignments caused a version change from 3.9.4 to 3.10.0.

It evaluated performance using two metrics -the area under the precision recall curve (AUPR) and the L2 distance. The AUPR evaluates the ability to detect the presence of microbes (binary presence/absence) above a relative abundance threshold, taking into consideration the precision and recall rates as said threshold is adjusted. A species-level AUPR of 1.0 indicates that there is a threshold (proportion of reads) above which all true positive species can be identified with no false positive species. The L2 distance provides a complementary metric that considers the similarity in relative abundances between the results and the ground truth.",

The unambiguously mapped datasets demonstrated limited resolution for distinguishing the tools when evaluated by AUPR and L2, as most tools show relatively high performance (with AUPR scores above 0.8 at the species level, Figure 3A ). Consistent with Ye et al, we observed that the greatest differences between tools was in the reduced precision at high recall. IDseq protein alignments (NR) demonstrated greater AUPR than IDseq nucleotide (NT) across most datasets, but consistently identified more taxa at low abundance (less than 1%), therefore resulting in reduced precision ( Figure 3C) . Meanwhile, IDseq NT exhibited increased specificity. IDseq NT and NR had a mean AUPR across all the datasets of 0.9627 and 0.9633, respectively. The top mean AUPR of any single tool was achieved by metaothello (0.9661), followed by Kraken2 (0.9635). Given Kraken2's performance on the unambiguous benchmark datasets and its wide adoption for relative microbial abundance estimation, additional analyses focused on comparison against Kraken2 ( Figure 3BC ). Another distinguishing factor between the tools was in the number of reads that were \"unclassified\" across multiple datasets. mmseq2, metaothello, kaiju, and bracken consistently left > 10% of reads \"unclassified\". IDseq (NT and NR) removed an average of 10% of the reads during host filtering and QC steps, but of the remaining sequences, an average of less than 1% of reads were unmapped across the ten datasets. This can be attributed in part to IDseq always assigning reads to a species when an alignment exists (increasing sensitivity at the expense of specificity) and secondly to the use of assembled contigs to refine alignments where short reads may have been unmapped.",

Meanwhile, IDseq NR recalled Rhinovirus C alignments down to 70% sequence divergence, demonstrating a greater sensitivity for divergent virus detection. We note that IDseq NR experienced a rapid drop in total recall (8,558 reads correctly mapping to Rhinovirus C, of 10,000 total and 8,558 passing QC steps at 70% sequence similarity vs. 0 reads detected at 65% sequence similarity). This highlights an artifact of the computational cost-saving mechanisms employed by IDseq -whereby a BLAST database is constructed from only the subset of accessions identified in the initial short-read GSNAP and Rapsearch2 alignments to the NCBI database. In cases where the highly divergent short-read sequences don't match to NT or NR in the initial alignment, the BLAST database will be empty and none of the reads or contigs will map. However, IDseq does provide the ability to download all assembled contigs, enabling offline interrogation of this divergent \"dark matter\". Manual BLASTx of contigs assembled by SPADES in IDseq to the full NCBI database, was able to recover the Rhinovirus C identity down to 55% sequence identity. Future iterations of the IDseq pipeline may aim to automate the manual follow-up steps for divergent viral contigs as well as incorporating other tools for dark matter investigation to probe for pathogen motifs.",

This is explained by the QC steps in the IDseq pipeline, which removed ~15% of reads at the PriceSeq filtering step due to low quality -an expected outcome given that the simulated reads mimic error models of Illumina sequencers (Methods). Of the reads remaining after host filtering, IDseq identified 100% as aligning to Rhinovirus C. This pattern persists down to 95% sequence similarity, at which point Kraken2 begins to identify fewer reads. While some Rhinovirus C reads are identified down to 75% sequence similarity (same as IDseq NT), IDseq NT identified a significantly greater number of reads mapping to Rhinovirus C at increasing levels of divergence. Specifically, at 80% divergence, 8,544 reads mapped by IDseq NT while only 1,042 reads mapped by Kraken2. Altogether, these benchmark results are consistent with existing reports of the utility of IDseq NR in detecting divergent viruses [48] and are within the ranges of nucleotide divergence associated with emerging human pathogens (Supplemental Text).",

Figure 2A shows the number of reads removed by each host filtration and QC step. One challenge for mNGS-based pathogen detection is that host sequences dominate the mNGS library. Notably, in CHRF_0094, chikungunya virus reads in sample CHRF_0094 represented less than 1% of the total sequencing reads. However, after IDseq's host filtering and QC steps, it represented 63% of the remaining non-host reads. A second, widely acknowledged challenge for mNGS data interpretation is the presence of environmental contaminants. Best-practices suggest including at least one water control with every sequencing experiment [34, 52] . To assist with interpretation of results with respect to control samples, IDseq implements a z-score approach (Methods) first described in Wilson et al. [53] . Z-score statistics computed by IDseq indicate the significance of relative abundance estimates in a sample as compared to the user-selected background controls -which may include water controls or healthy control samples. Z-score thresholds can be imposed to remove taxa that are prevalent in the water or healthy controls. In sample CHRF_0094, 8 rows (4 species from 4 genera) were reported with NT reads per million (rPM) greater than 10, NR rPM > 10, and z-score > 1 (a relatively stringent threshold employed to remove many of the low-abundance taxa for first-pass evaluation). 7,876.2 rPM were associated with chikungunya virus, of which many were associated with the 4 contigs aligning to chikungunya virus. By using the IDseq portal coverage visualization, which displays reads and contigs in association with their top matched GenBank accession, we observe that the longest contig, approximately 11kb, represented full-genome coverage of the nearest GenBank accession ( Figure 2F ).",

As an additional real-world example of this utility, we provide a vignette from the recent SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak. On January 30, 2020, a team of researchers from the CNM-NIAID (National Center for Parasitology, Entomology, and Malaria Control -National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease) collaboration in Cambodia obtained a nasopharyngeal swab sample from a patient with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The library preparation and sequencing were completed in-country by February 1, 2020 [56] . Analysis of the sample (4.5 million single reads) using IDseq against an NCBI database version from 2019-09-17, which did not contain the known sequences for SARS-CoV-2 that have since been deposited on NCBI, identified 571 reads aligned to the genus Betacoronvirus, with an average amino acid percent identity of 92.3% (by NR). The sample took 14 minutes to analyze end-to-end and the most abundant species was severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, with 542 NT reads (22 contigs) and 571 NR reads (24 contigs), representing ~33% genome coverage. To quantify the IDseq pipeline's recall for SARS-CoV-2 sequences, we built a BLAST database from the 54 sequences associated with SARS-CoV-2, which had been deposited in NCBI between January and February 2, 2020 as a result of widespread efforts by the global science community. By BLASTing all non-host reads from the sample against the known SARS-CoV-2 sequence database, we identified 584 reads mapping to SARS-CoV-2. As compared to this ground-truth value, IDseq demonstrated 97.8% read-level recall. This indicates that for an emerging threat, IDseq was able to successfully provide information on the presence of a pathogen prior to the existence of full reference genomes associated with the organism.

The choices of tools, parameters, databases, and datasets may all influence the conclusions. Our aim in this study was simply to test performance relative to other tools. We compare IDseq's default database (NCBI nt and nr) against the default databases for all other tools included by Ye et. al. Though it is possible that other tools' performance would improve given a comparably large database, configuring these details requires computational expertise that directly opposes the readily usable nature of IDseq. IDseq continues to use the full NCBI nt and nr database given their advantages for detecting divergent viruses and incorporating data on novel bacterial pathogens. However, the large database size results in longer run-times and the lack of curation induces the potential for noise in alignment results due to errant sequence assignment errors upon upload to the NCBI databases. There is ongoing work by many researchers to evaluate curated databases for mNGS analyses, but for now IDseq continues to update its database biannually. To support continued benchmarking of IDseq and empower researchers to test IDseq's performance for their particular applications, we have released the open-source idseq-bench tool, which was used to generate the divergent virus dataset and for evaluating the per-read recall results.",

IDseq aims to be a valuable resource for researchers in the infectious diseases field but does not intend to become clinically validated. While IDseq can yield insights that inform public health policies, laboratory testing priorities, and real-time decisions for confirmatory clinical testing, clinical validation of the pipeline requires locking of the system for adherence to strict guidelines. IDseq will remain under continued development in order to 1) improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of the results; 2) expand the integration with other tools to enable researchers' flexibility in the downstream analysis of their processed results; and 3) support the expanding number of mNGS sequencing platforms that will be used by researchers for pathogen detection globally. Some possible future directions for improvements to the IDseq pipeline have been discussed throughout. Notably, IDseq's current assembly-based alignment steps results in failure to automatically identify divergent viruses beyond 70% divergent, while BLASTx of IDseq-generated contigs can enable detection down to 55% divergent. Automating full NCBI BLASTx of putative viral contigs would simplify offline analyses. Similarly, we showed that IDseq NR had reduced precision, which made relative abundance estimation of lowabundance taxa challenging. Allowing for non-species-specific mappings or propagating estimates of species-level ambiguity to increase species-level resolution for low-abundance taxa may provide another avenue for continued development. Finally, continued integration with other analysis tools and sequencing technologies will further enhance the usability of IDseq for mNGS data analysis.",

In the context of pathogen detection, mNGS libraries often contain extremely low quantities of RNA input. It has been shown that during library preparation, samples with low input experience amplification background contaminants [34] . ERCC controls can be used to mitigate the effect of low input libraries and to quantify the total input. To enable researchers to rapidly assess the quality of their libraries and the limit of detection, IDseq provides ERCC counts for each sample.

Researchers can create a background model by selecting control samples sequenced via their standard laboratory protocols or select from a default set of publicly available water controls. From the selected set of samples, the distribution of reads for each taxon is computed. The z-score field of the IDseq sample report is calculated as the z-score for each taxonomic ID based on its prevalence in the selected background model. If a particular taxonomic ID is not found in the set of control samples, then the z-score will be set to 100. If the taxonomic ID is not found in the sample, the z-score will be set to -100. The z-score metric also feeds into the \"aggregate score\", which combines information from NT rPM, NR rPM, NT z-score, and NR zscore to provide an estimate of \"microbial importance\" for a particular sample based on the relative abundance both with the sample as well as in the background. This experimental metric aims to rank rare organisms that may be implicated in an infection higher, even if they are present only at low abundance.",

Overall, we note that due to the relative comparable performance of tools on these particular datasets, distinctions in AUPR may be the result of just one or two missed taxa. In this case, IDseq NT failed to identify Enterobacter asburiae (taxID = 61645) and identified only a small number (< 10) of reads aligning to Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (taxID = 228). Meanwhile, IDseq NR identified successfully recovered reads from E. asburiae and produced a comparably low number of reads mapping to P. haloplanktis. IDseq NT did identify many reads mapping to Enterobacter soli, which has been noted to have high genomic similarity to E. asburiae and E. aerogenes (p-distance: 1.06 and 1.19%, respectively [4] ), both of which were included in the simulated dataset. This highlights the challenge with disambiguating short reads from taxa with a high degree of genomic similarity. We emphasize the practical importance of orthogonal validation of hits via assays (ie PCR) targeting unique regions of the genome. However, it is possible that the expansion of reference databases has improved specificity beyond the original dataset simulation. The particular GenBank accession to which all E. soli reads map (CP003026.1 Enterobacter soli strain LF7a, complete genome), was added to the database in April 2019, while reads were simulated in 2016 [5] . The same trend is observed for P. haloplanktis. IDseq NT and NR both identified significantly more reads mapping to P. arctica, a member of the P. haloplanktis-like group [6] . The associated GenBank accession to which the majority of reads map (CP011025.1 -Pseudoalteromonas arctica A 37-1-2 chromosome I, complete sequence) was added in September of 2017.

IDseq filtered out 15.6% of reads during the host and QC filtering pipeline steps, leaving 84,410 non-host reads for down-stream analysis. Notably, IDseq nt demonstrates the highest per-species recall (0.68, IQR = 0.43 -0.80), significantly different than NR (0.46, IQR = 0.15 -0.61, p = 0.005, Wilcoxon rank sum) and Kraken2 (0.18, IQR = 0.11 -0.35, p = 0.005, Wilcoxon rank sum) ( Figure S3B ). All tools successfully identified the presence of all 13 microbial species. In addition to these species, IDseq NT, NR, and Kraken2 identified 83, 371, and 167 false positive species, respectively. Again, IDseq NT and NR had greater proportions of total reads mapping to these false-positive species (31.7% and 49.7% for NT and NR, respectively) as compared to Kraken2, with only 0.6 % of reads mapping to false-positive species and the majority of ambiguous reads mapping at higher levels of classification (70.9%).",

Additionally, these simulations sample from across the genome. However, we know that ribosomal sequences can be used for typing of bacteria and studies have previously shown improved sensitivity with RNA-seq, where ribosomal RNA comprises the greatest portion of sequenced nucleic acid [13, 14] . Thus, IDseq results must be interpreted by the researcher with respect to the sample type and sequencing prep.
