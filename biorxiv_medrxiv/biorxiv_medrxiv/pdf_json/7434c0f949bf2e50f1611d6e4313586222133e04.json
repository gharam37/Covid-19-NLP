            "text": "COVID-19 has been evolving worldwide in the first half of 2020 and also in Japan, the confirmed number of infected people was reported as 5,438 on the website of Ministry of Health 1 , Labour and Welfare (MHLW) as of 11 a. m. of April 12, 2020. This number, confirmed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests, only shows the subpopulation of the infected and its true number is presumably more than this. While the estimation of true number is very important in order to prevent from socalled collapsed healthcare system or overwhelming hospitals as well as in order to acquire herd immunity in the future, it is challenging to estimate the true number with the number of tested positive. Its difficulty comes from 1) the extremely limited number of PCR tests with various reasons and 2) as PCR test is performed when the subject is suspicious of having COVID-19 infection with certain medical situation such as high fever or continuous general fatigue, etc., sampling of PCR test is not randomized. That being understood, if the PCR test subjects are randomized and the number of PCR tests is sufficient, by calculating the product of national population and (confirmed number of infected)/(number of PCR tests), a satisfactorily reliable true number of infected can be obtained. However, since only the people suspicious of being infected undergo the tests actually the positive rate is much higher than that of the randomized samples. Using the current (confirmed number of infected)/(number of PCR tests) leads to estimate the true number quite excessively. For example, as of April 9, 2020, MHLW website 2 states that 4,667 out of 54,284 was tested positive. If this rate is multiplied by 126 million of entire Japan population, approximately 10 million is the assumed true number of the infected, which would not reflect the actual situation. Under the status quo as such, a large-scale randomized questionnaire (1st) by MHLW/LINE corporation was conducted from March 31 to April 1, and the result was made open 3 on April 10. The authors analyzed these data statistically and estimated the true number of COVID-19 infected patients.",

            "text": "Firstly, LINE questionnaire will be described here. As discussed in the report by MHLW, high fever caught in the questionnaire is considered as including the fever with COVID-19 as its cause. In contrast with the ongoing PCR test, this questionnaire is quasi-completely randomized, 9 exhibiting its large scale of 23,992,701 replies. This means that these data can be served as the fundamental data to deduce the true number of infected. As it should be noted that the data contains the fever with other reasons than COVID-19, the data itself could not be regarded as the number of the infected. The authors underpinned the rate of high fever per prefecture, which were served as the data source for estimating true number of the infected. Figure 1 exhibits the number of high fever/responses per prefecture by LINE questionnaire. Bar charts were provided after sorting data in descending order. Except for the three prefectures which showed the extremely high numbers, the difference among the rest remains within a certain range. As reported in the news, the spread of COVID-19 infection is not homogenous nationwide; i. e., in Tokyo, only seldom infections were found when many were found in Hokkaido in its initial days. Therefore, it was expected that the distribution of high-fever patient caused by COVID-19 shows a similar distribution to the confirmed cases according to the regions visibly. In contrast, the distribution of high-fever patient caused by non-COVID-19 reasons was considered as stable regardless of the regions; that the identical distribution, with some extent of statistical error, could be expected. If the variations according to the regions could be taken into account, the part of the high-fever patients caused by COVID-19 could be extracted. In order to evaluate the appropriateness of this model, the comparison between the national distribution of PCR positive patients at the timing of LINE questionnaire and that of high-fever patients assessed in LINE questionnaire, would be effective. It could not be expected to determine the true absolute patient number with PCR test data, however, the relative distribution reflects the true patient distribution properly, assuming that the philosophy to design PCR test per prefecture remains identical nationwide. With this consideration, the authors could believe that the simple comparison between the distributions of PCR positivity and LINE high-fever suffice. Needless to state, when pursuing the trend of positive patients, not only the regional difference but also the time-dependent change of a patient history from the infection via the latent period to the appearance of initial symptom, should be considered. Simply applying the current statistical data as the data for infected might cause a loss of accuracy; rather the data at the exact timing of LINE questionnaire should be applied. Furthermore, as the fixation of number of the infected happens certain days later from the infection, waiting for the continuous symptom(s) to decide to perform PCR test, not the confirmed number of a date, but the newly symptomatic patient number of the same date should be used. Meanwhile, as the information of confirmed number of patients at a certain date includes only the limited number of initial symptom dates, the exclusive use of these data makes the analysis statistically non-robust.",

Japan 5 displayed in Fig. 2 . This dataset has the data of initial symptom and those of confirmed positivity (as of April 12). As the date of initial symptom was not identified for every patient, this data showed only the identified data, meanwhile, satisfactorily statistical distribution was exhibited. The authors superimposed the Gaussian distribution onto this data (where x is the difference between dates of initial symptom and confirmed positivity). Although this distribution model was not completely concordant with the data and there might exist some other better distribution which fits more, it was shown that there are 4 to 5 days of difference between the dates of initial symptom and confirmed positivity. It could be reasonable to use the confirmed positivity data on April 5 to be compared with LINE questionnaire data on March 31 to April 1. Fig. 3 displayed the accumulated number of confirmed positivity on April 5 per prefecture, divided by the population obtained from the National Survey 2015. It shows the fact that the rates of COVID-19 positivity varies largely with each prefecture. As the next step, the authors investigated the correlation between the distribution of positivity rate per prefecture and that of highfever rate.

It was not quite explicable that Hokkaido is out of the general order, however, its vast surface area and extremely low population density other than Sapporo and some other outstanding cities might influence and its comparison with other prefectures remains challenging. At any rate, as excluding the extraordinary observation data is a common statistical technique, the authors decided to use the remaining 43 prefectures.
