Such information is critical to identify high risk patients and to facilitate planning (e.g., forecasting the need for hospital beds and mechanical ventilators).

However, other than age, results have been inconsistent. Furthermore, few studies accounted for potential confounding by age and sex when they evaluated other potential risk factors. For example, some studies reported that hypertension is a risk factor of severe COVID-19, but their observations may simply reflect the fact that hypertension is more common in older adults. 3 Nonetheless, despite the lack of robust evidence, this observation, together with the fact SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as an entry to human body, 4 has raised a concern about continued use of reninangiotensin system increase among some clinicians and researchers. 5, 6 In this context, we conducted a systematic review of studies reporting cardiovascular risk factors and their relation to severe manifestation of COVID-19 (i.e., death, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] , the need of mechanical ventilator support, and admission to an intensive care unit [ICU]), with a particular interest on studies that adjusted for key confounders such as age and sex.",

Overall quality was based on the Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS), 7 which includes eight items about selection, comparability, and outcome (Web Appendix 2). The NOS score for cohorts studies ranges from 0 to 9; a score greater than 6 was considered high-quality. For cross-sectional studies, we applied an adapted form of the NOS. 8 The maximum score was 10, and 7 points were used to identify studies with high quality.The paired reviewers resolved conflicts related to their own data collection and quality assessment.",

An important question is whether these associations are independent of major confounders, particularly age. Although we could not obtain a definite answer as very few studies ran multivariable models, our meta-regression analysis indicated some degree of confounding by age. One study by Zhou et al showed substantial attenuation of the association between coronary heart disease and severe COVID-19. On the other hand, Liang et al showed independent associations of hypertension and diabetes with severe COVID-19 in a relatively large sample size of 1,590 patients. These is also biologic plausibility. Hypertension and diabetes are leading risk factors for CVD and kidney diseases, and there is evidence that COVID-19 damages these organs. 34, 35 Available studies provide scant evidence related to the hypothesized adverse effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors on severity of COVID-19 infection. As noted above, there is biological plausibility for potential associations of COVID-19 with hypertension and diabetes, two comorbidities associated with use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. Only one study reported the prevalence of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors use. 13 In this study, ~30% of patients reported prevalent hypertension, but only ~5% of patients were taking renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. 13 Thus, it is reasonable that many expert organizations recommend continuing this category of medications until better evidence becomes available. 4 Our results can potentially be used to guide decision-making. While the lack of discrete age thresholds for severe COVID-19 complicates this process, data on case fatality rates from three countries (Web Table 2 ) suggest that age older than 60 or 65 years confers high risk of severe COVID-19 (relative risk > ~5 compared to <50 years). Our results also indicate male sex is an independent risk factor with a pooled relative risk of ~1.7. Although it is very likely that the pooled crude relative risk of ~3-3.5 for hypertension, diabetes, and CVD overestimate their impact beyond age and sex, all or some of them may each confer 1.5-2 times greater risk. Thus, using these factors, it is possible to estimate, at least crudely, the risk of severe COVID-19. For example, a man aged 60-65 years old, with either hypertension, diabetes, or prior CVD would .

However, given similar case-fatality rates and clinical manifestations across different countries, it seems likely that these results are largely generalizable. Nonetheless, we need to acknowledge regional variations of some risk factors (e.g., ~25-fold difference in the prevalence of smoking in men vs. women in China 36 ) and thus future investigations in different regions would be valuable. Second, we did not include non-English publications. Third, most studies reported odds ratios, which are known to overestimate risk ratio when the prevalence of exposures is relatively high. Fourth, we cannot deny the possibility that some patients were included in multiple studies especially in the China CDC report 14 and other Chinese studies. Nonetheless, the pooled estimates were largely similar in analyses that excluded the China CDC data (data not shown). Finally, the literature of COVID-19 is growing rapidly, and thus there is a lag time from our literature search and publication. On the other hand, our systematic review has several strengths: in-depth review of CVD and its risk factors, a clinically relevant definitions of severe COVID-19 that minimize subjective reporting, meta-regression to explore potential confounding, and relatively short elapsed time of ~2 weeks between the literature search and manuscript submission.",

In the one available study that assessed low-density lipoprotein as a risk factor of COVID-19, Wu et al reported that higher levels were associated with lower risk of severe COVID-19 (0.63 [0.44-0.88] per 1 mmol/L increment) 22 ; no other lipid fractions were reported.Potential confounding by age and sexAmong the identified studies, only two studies reported age-adjusted relative risk estimates of these clinical factors. Specifically, Zhou et al showed that adjusting for age attenuated the association between severe COVID-19 and coronary heart disease from 21.40 (4.64-98.76) to 2.14 (0.26-17.79).25 In contrast, Liang et al only reported estimates from a multivariable model including age, with an adjusted odds ratio 1.88 (1.22-2.90) for hypertension and 2.21 (1.33-3.66)",
