A previously developed questionnaire was used. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of COVID-19 knowledge. Results: A total of 1,208 participants were involved in this study from the three countries (Jordan = 389, Saudi Arabia = 433, and Kuwait = 386). The majority of participants (n = 810, 67.2%) were females and aged 30 to 49 years (n = 501, 41.5%). Participants had moderate overall COVID-19 knowledge with a mean score of 7.93 (\u00b11.72) out of 12, 66.1%. Participants had better knowledge about disease prevention and control with 83.0%, whereas the lowest sub-scale scores were for questions about disease transmission routes (43.3%). High education level was an important predictor of greater COVID-19 knowledge scores (p<0.01). Conclusion: Middle Eastern participants are of a relatively low level of knowledge about COVID-19, particularly regarding its transmission routes. Policymakers are recommended to develop informative COVID-19 related campaigns targeted specifically towards university students, unemployed individuals and those with lower levels of education.",

Predominantly, it is characterised by fever, fatigue, and dry cough. Approximately, 20.0% of COVID-19 patients developed to the severe stage, which is characterised by acute respiratory distress syndrome, bleeding, and coagulation dysfunction (1) . In the Middle East region, this virus has appeared in some countries before others. For example, it has been firstly identified in Iran then spread in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. The spread of the virus in Kuwait earlier than others could be attributed to the fact that there was a national holiday in Kuwait in the period between the 23 rd to the 29 th of February, where most people used to spend it abroad. As people returned from vacations, confirmed cases with COVID-19 started to raise. In March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the COVID-19 outbreak is a pandemic (2). The pandemic lingers to take a hefty toll on healthcare professionals, families, communities and the whole world. In response to that, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and neighbouring Kuwait took drastic measures early on in a bid to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes halting air travels, imposing curfews, and quarantining and testing thousands of individuals (3, 4) .",

Such findings will be valuable for public-health policymakers and healthcare professionals to recognize target populations for health education activities on the COVID-19 outbreak. This is critical as the countries involved in the study are still at the beginning of the outbreak and governments took extreme measures to contain the pandemic. But such measures, which include imposing a curfew, are virtually useless unless were accompanied by responsible individuals' preventative practices (3) . In this study as well as in previous studies in China, US, and UK, an association has been noticed between particular demographic characteristics and knowledge, beliefs, and practices towards COVID-19 (1, 15) .

The results are aligned to the finding that lack of knowledge is related to young people (18 -29 years) . Such findings are alarming, as the lack of knowledge about COVID-19 is correlated with a higher prevalence rate of the infection (1, 22) . Therefore, there is a need for improving students' knowledge about COVID-19 by means of health education, which may also result in improvements in their practices towards COVID-19. Such results could support the decision made by many countries including Jordan, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia in taking a political commitment to temporally close all educational institutions to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, the action involved 188 countries, affecting around 1.5 billion learners. The mode of teaching moved into emergency remote learning (22, 23) . Yet, although the closure of schools and educational facilities is a good mean to prevent young adults from mixing with others, it will not prevent exposure even with curfew laws. Young adults will always go out and get exposed to the risk of getting infected as the level of knowledge is low. A recent study on COVID-19 concluded that educational institutions closures alone would preclude only 2-4% of deaths, which is a lot less than other social distancing interventions. The integration of additional social distancing strategies along with educational institutions closures needs to be considered (24) .

A study on SARS demonstrated that a higher knowledge score was found to be connected with improved adherence to precautionary practices (11, 26) . Of interest, an income of \u2265 1,409 $ (p<0.05) had a significant negative association with the knowledge score in our cohort, showing that high income does not improve knowledge and practices. However, this is contrary to a previous study on the influenza pandemic, where there was no association between knowledge and income (26). A possible reason for such result is that the higher income of individuals is accompanied with low education level. The current study showed that knowledge scores significantly differed across marital status categories (P<0.002), divorced participants had a significant negative association with COVID-19 knowledge score (p<0.01). Our findings were in line with the results obtained from the study on COVID-19 in China, which revealed a statistically significant difference in knowledge score according to marital status, however, they found that the category denotes as others (included divorced and widowed, separated, remarried) showing the highest score in knowledge (11.0 out of 12.0) (91.7%), P <0.001) (1). This difference could be justified by two elements. Firstly, different countries might have different cultural dimension and hence results could not be compared. Secondly, the group used in the Chinese study included all divorced, separated, widowed and remarried individuals and hence we could not build a good correlation (1).",

In addition, we used an online survey for data collection and therefore, some vulnerable populations within the three countries under the COVID-19 pandemic could not be reached and we may have missed some of the targeted population.

The original questionnaire was developed based on the National Health Commission of the People's republic of China's guidelines for clinical and community management of COVID-19 (13, 14). The original questionnaire had 12-questions (true/false questions): four regarding clinical presentations (K1 -K4), three regarding transmission routes (K5 -K7), and five regarding prevention and control (K8 -K12) of COVID-19",

            "text": "Although the low percentage 15.3% (183/1,194) with regard to the reported practices of attending crowded places were encouraging, only 50.1% (605/1,195) of participants declared that they wore masks when leaving home. The World Health Organization (WHO) during Feb 2020 indicated that there is a priority for research to focus on actions that can save lives now which included \"Optimise use of protective equipment and other infection prevention and control measures in health care and community settings -It is critical to protect health care workers and the community from the transmission and create a safe working environment\" (10). The needs to avoid the crowd and wear masks upon leaving the house are key practices and top priority of the WHO. A similar study conducted by Zhong et.al. (2020) in China (1), showed that knowledge score was 90.0% and citizens were compliant with protective measures, where 96.4% avoided crowded places and 98.0% wore masks upon departing their homes during COVID-19 outbreak (1). These results undoubtedly revealed that there were significant gaps in the public knowledge about COVID-19 within the Arabic speaking Middle Eastern countries and hence suggest the need for improving individuals' COVID-19 knowledge via health education, which may cause improvements in their practices towards COVID-19 (1). Although the situation of the pandemic is severe and the news reports on this public health emergency through various channels of information and via hotlines of the Ministries of Health, a lot of people learn about this infectious disease from invalid social media resources such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, etc. This has also been mentioned by Gelsetzer (2020) (15), where it has been noticed that a substantial proportion of people in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) believe in the \"myth busters\" who continue to circulate inaccurate information about COVID-19. Such information included that rinsing nose with saline, using a hand dryer, taking antibiotics, and gargling mouthwash could be effective preventive measures against COVID-19, and that receiving a letter or package from China may pose a risk of Covid-19 infection. Other unreliable beliefs of the general public in both the US and the UK about COVID-19 were that it is a fatal disease and that children are at high risk of death from it. Another disbelief was that medical masks are highly effective in protecting from catching a COVID-19 infection (15). However, people in the Middle East region have reported some similar beliefs and other different. For example, in the current study, most participant .9%) reported that it is unnecessary for children and younger adults to take preventive measures against COVID-19. Thus, in contrast to people in the US and UK, people in the Middle East believe that children and younger adults are at lower risk of COVID-19 infection. On the other hand, most people (57.0%) in the Middle East shared similar beliefs regarding wearing medical masks to prevent them from COVID-19 infection. Regarding the fatality feature of COVID-19, Middle East participants reported conflicting beliefs to people in the US and UK, as the majority (89.0%) believe that although there is no effective treatment, supportive measurements and symptoms alleviation can cure the infection.Unfortunately, the present study showed that 15.3% of participants still go to crowded places and around 50.0% do not wear masks when leaving homes recently. However, not wearing a mask when leaving home could be related to that most of the participants (84.7%) were very cautious and avoided crowded places. This strict preventive practice from the participants could be primarily attributed to the very strict prevention and control measures implemented by local governments such as traffic limits all throughout the countries and the shutdown of shopping malls and work in all sectors except the health sector. Second, this could be due to the population fear of the virus and its high infectivity.In China, although a study byZhong et al. (2020) was conducted during the very early stage of the pandemic, people achieved a correct rate of 90.0% on COVID-19 knowledge questionnaire (1). In addition, the population's adherence to the preventive and control measures was higher than in the Middle East, where almost all people stayed home during the virus outbreak period, and wear masks when leaving homes. This could be attributed to the more serious situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, where higher rates of death were recorded, resulting in higher beliefs and adherence to preventive measures.",
