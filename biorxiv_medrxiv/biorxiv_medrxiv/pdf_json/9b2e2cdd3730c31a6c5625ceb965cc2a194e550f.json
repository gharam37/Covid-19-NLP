            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 prompted stringent mitigation measures to \"flatten the curve\" quickly leading to an asphyxiated US economy as a national side effect. The resulting flattened curve remain exponential and may still exceed available healthcare resources and capacity during and around its peak. Moreover, while isolation and containment can scale down daily cases significantly, such a mitigation strategy also prolong the outbreak. Since economic activity is inversely proportional to mitigation, curtailing the outbreak with sustained mitigation can stifle the economy severely having disasterous repercussions. Mitigation for the duration of the outbreak may therefore be unsustainable and risk a second wave of infections. The method for active pandemic curve management (MAPCM) presented herein has the potential to shape the outbreak curve in a controlled manner for optimal utilization of healthcare resources during the pandemic, while drastically shortening the outbreak duration compared to mitigation by itself without trading off lives. This method allows mitigation measures to be relaxed gradually from day one, which equates to the ramping up of economic activity, and it leaves breathing room for the economy from the onset of a pandemic. Since outbreak curves (such as projected hospitalizations per day) can be programmed using this method, they can also be shaped to accommodate changing needs during the outbreak. To be successful the method must be implemented early enough in the outbreak. Implementing the method incorrectly can result in a herd immunity levels of infections. MAPCM is a method and not a model. It is compatible with any appropriate model. In the paper a hybrid logistic model is used for illustration.",

While many vital characteristics of the pathogen are still unclear it appears that the virus is as deadly as it is contagious. The actual fatality rate hasn't fully crystalized yet due to insufficient testing. Some speculate fatality rates well below 1%. Even if the fatality rate is close to that of influenza, this virus distinguishes itself by concentrating annual totals for deaths and critical care needs into a matter of weeks. A worrying statistic is the death rate among resolved cases, which is varying between 10% to over 90%.",

However, the level of mitigation required to flatten the curve can asphyxiate an economy due to layoffs and closing businesses. To make matters worse, flattening the curve also prolongs the outbreak for an unsustainable amount of time. Moreover, the flattened curve might still exceed healthcare capacity, as it maintains its exponential character despite being damped.

The stock market plunged within a day of announcing even mild mitigation through voluntary self-isolation in the United States. Closing business for all but essential functions lead to layoffs and skyrocketing unemployment that could have serious consequences for any country.

Sustained mitigation to flatten the curve is the worst of both worlds from an economic perspective as shown in Figure 1 (a). Not only is the economic activity halted thus pushing an otherwise healthy economy into freefall, it also prolongs it well beyond the herd immunity situation. As shown in Figure 1 (b) MAPCM can start off with similar levels of mitigation, but immediately starts lifting them gradually which eases the economy back to normal from day one. A disappointing outcome of these increasinly stringent containment strategies is that while the outbreak curves are indeed being scaled down, they aren't flattened by much. In fact, the curves for projected hospitalizations with full mitigation remain exponential with peak amplitudes that still exceed available healthcare capacities as shown in Figure 2 and again in Figure 3 , which depicts new cases being reported daily under a few different strategies.",

Similar pulse-shaping is performed for electromagnetic launcher technology shown in Figure 11 (a) in the author's laboratory during every firing event, except that it all happens within one-thousandth of a second instead of over months. There are some similarities between controlling a pandemic curve and controlling the railgun. Both are complex systems and each produces an unwanted curve that needs to be shaped into something else. Applying the method to a pandemic makes it possible to get ahead of the curve by controlling the outbreak, instead of staying behind the curve and letting this curve control a country.",

The method can be useful to many countries that want to get ahead of the curve, especially those with economies that are too fragile to go into full-on lock-down like the USA is doing. In the USA, the method could be implemented at the national level or at the state level. Since every locality has a unique character with its own unique challenges, the viability of this reshaping method needs to be tested using their own models and their own mitigation measures before implementing it to address their specific needs.

This method makes it possible, for example, to impose mitigation amid a pandemic crisis to keep the hospitalizations within available healthcare capacity thresholds while keeping the economy moving without sacrificing lives. It was shown how the amplitude and duration of a controlled curve can be traded off against one another. Better results can be achieved using the method than imposing mitigation by itself. This method is promising if implemented early enough in outbreak cycle. It was also demonstrated that the method can be used to program the outbreak curve to custom fit changing needs. The rules and mechanical logistics for controlling the curve of an actual country or locality depend on the unique identity and character of the locality. The rules and mechanisms for implementing mitigation strategies in combination with MAPCM will be treated elsewhere.",
