This new strain within the LGG clade may have arisen by a form of homologous recombination from the core sequence (CS-B) of the transcription-regulating sequences of SAS-CoV-2 itself and has rapidly increased to approximately one third of reported sequences from Europe during the month of March 2020. We note that these polymorphisms are predicted to reduce the binding of an overlying putative HLA-C*07-restricted epitope and that HLA-C*07 is prevalent in Caucasians being carried by >40% of the population. The findings suggest that homologous recombination may have occurred since its introduction into humans and be a mechanism for increased viral fitness and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to human populations.",

However, the extent to which selection pressures operating within those populations also impact SARS-CoV-2 diversity is currently not known. Functional effects of new genetic changes need to be considered in ongoing public health measures to contain infection around the world and in the development of universal vaccines and antiviral therapy. Here we describe a new emerging strain of SARS-CoV-2 within the LGG clade that appears to be the result of a homologous recombination event that introduced three adjacent nucleotide changes spanning two residues of the nucleocapsid protein. That strain expanded rapidly in Europe in March 2020. This protein forms an integral part of the virus lifecycle and is known to be highly immunogenic.",

Evidence for such adaptations with closely linked compensatory mutations are known to occur under host immune pressure as is well established for other adaptable RNA viruses such as HIV 1,2 and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 3 . These viruses have such a high rate of viral replication and error-prone reverse transciptase that a massive swarm of viral variants with ongoing recombination between residues is generated continuously. As a result selection pressure exerted by immune responses or other selective pressures effectively operate on each separate residue independently 4 . In contrast, coronaviruses encode proofreading machinery and have a propensity to adapt by homologous recombination between viruses rather than classic step-wise individual mutations driven by selective pressures operating on single viral residues. This, together with the routine nature of their cross-species transmission 5 , led Graham and Baric 6 to presciently warn in 2010 that it was a matter of when, rather than if, a pathogenic coronavirus pandemic would occur in humans.

We therefore predict that the K203/R204 (AAA CGA) change is likely to remain fixed and intermediates to the wild type are unlikely to be found. It will be critical to determine if the introduction of the AAACGA motif results in a replicative or other fitness cost to the virus, creates an alternative subgenomic mRNA transcript or RNA secondary structure or increases nucleocapsid activity as this could indicate that there may be viral attenuation as passage occurs globally through populations of diverse immunogenetic background.",

As previously shown for SARS-CoV, T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 are likely to target the nucleocapsid 14 . Notably, SARS-CoV-2 R203K/G204R polymorphisms modify the predicted binding of the HLA-C*07 allele to a putative Tcell epitope containing these residues. Escape from HLA-C-restricted T-cell responses may conceivably confer a fitness advantage for SARS-CoV-2, particularly in European populations where HLA-C*07 is prevalent and carried by >40% of the population (www.allelefrequencies.net).",

The consequences of viral host adaptation for SARS-CoV-2 immunopathogenesis may also be complex. If SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses define the specific nature of the clinical illness, such adaptation may serve to favor prolonged, perhaps asymptomatic viral shedding. This phenomena has been demonstrated in the case of mutations in the influenza genome, with deleterious public health consequences for transmission and control 15 . If the host response to SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the efficacy or regulation of a specific antiviral cytotoxic T-cell response, adaptation may also impact individual pathways to serious complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and other end-organ disease. However, it is important to realize that as evidenced by HCV, HIV and other RNA viruses, any change in replicative fitness cost to the virus will not predictably translate to any attenuation of the nature of the disease in the host. As SARS-CoV-2 becomes globally established over a longer period of time, evolution towards a less immunogenic, but still highly transmissible infection could be facilitated by fixation and spread of immune-based selection events. This has been postulated to be the case for other human-adapted coronaviruses that eventually became established as seasonal \"common cold\" viruses.",

Circulating strains that contain the intermediate codon as the consensus resulting from a single step to the AGG lysine amino acid (i.e. the arginine codon AGA or the lysine codon AAG) appear completely absent among captured strains to date.To identify possible viral sources for homologous recombination with SARS-CoV-2, we initially performed a search of the motif in the nucleocapsid in related beta coronaviruses from human and other species in the public databases and only found the presence of the R203/G204 combination. We performed a similar search in our metatranscriptome data generated from a cohort study consisting of 65 subjects of which 43 had acute respiratory infections and 22 were asymptomatic. From the data family. None of the alpha coronaviruses had the R203/G204 or K203/R204 combination or indeed any variation at these sites (n=14; sequence depth >3000). We then performed a search for stretches of similarity using varying window sizes (>14bp including the motif;8 ) in all sequences. No significant hits were identified. However, the AAACGA motif overlaps with the core sequence (CS-B) of the transcription-regulating sequences 9 of SAR-CoV-2 itself and this motif has been found several times within SARS-CoV-2 at the end of the protein for ORF1ab, surface glycoprotein, envelope, ORF6, ORF7b and ORF8 (Supplementary Figure 1). New nucleocapsid polymorphisms likely emerged from existing strain containing the clade defining L84 (ORF8), G614 (S) and G251 (NS3) amino acids As many of the sequences have been generated using NGS technologies that likely reflect single strains across the viral genome, we examined whether the new polymorphisms occurred on specific existing viral genetic backgrounds. The K203/R204 polymorphisms so far only exist on strains that carry the following clade defining amino acids -L84 in ORF8, G614 in S and G251 in NS3 to form the combination (haplotype) KR-LGG (Figure 1A). A chronological analysis of the emergence of the different strains as defined by the five positions (and based on the collection date assigned to the deposited sequences) shows the transition between major forms (Figure 1B). The first sequences identified in China contained the RG-LDG combination that closely clusters with the SARS-CoV-2 strain RG-SDG that was first deposited in early January of Chinese origin and is present in both the bat 1A) and the RG-LDG strain was also the dominant strain that was identified in passengers and crew abroad the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan immediately prior to the more global dissemination of cases worldwide. The RG-LDG, RG-SDG and RG-LDV strains were circulating in Asia before mid-January, with entry into the West coast of the US with the first identified case in Washington State January 21, 2020 and by March the RG-SDG strain had become widespread in North America. The appearance of the RG-LGG and KR-LGG strains occurred in the database in late February in Europe and for the RG-LGG strain in the US by early-mid March. To date the viruses with the KR-LGG haplotype form a significant portion of circulating strains in the Netherlands and Iceland with smaller numbers in neighboring European countries and elsewhere. In the Netherlands the first confirmed case of Sars-CoV-2 infection was on February 28, 2020 in an individual who had recently visited the Lombardy region in Italy. Six cases that followed were also reported to be of linked either to travel to Lombardy or through contact with the first patient 10 . Similarly, inIceland the first reported case was also on February 28, 2020 from a returning traveler from Northern Italy with five cases that followed linked to Verona, Italy 10 . It is therefore likely that strains harboring these polymorphisms exist in Northern Italy but there is currently limited sequence data deposited on the specific viral strains in the most affected regions. In further support of this expectation, sequences deposited from the Brazilian government indicate the likely source of virus for the small number of strains with the KR-LGG haplotype in Brazil is Northern Italy.
