In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday 24th March, one day after a \"lockdown\" was implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the \"lockdown\" to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place.",

On the 23rd of March, with just over 6,000 confirmed cases, the UK Government implemented strict physical distancing measures instructing individuals to stay at home and avoid leaving their house except for essential work, to take one form of exercise a day, and to buy essential items such as food and medicines. This followed the closure of sporting events, schools, restaurants, bars, gyms and other leisure or hospitality-related businesses the previous week 3 and an increase in social distancing among the population that had been taking place for several days before the announcement 4 .",

Only one previous survey-conducted in two Chinese cities, Wuhan and Shanghai, in February 2020-quantified the impact of these measures on individuals' contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic 12 . In this paper, we describe a survey of contact patterns and compliance with physical distance measures and present results from a sample of adults in the UK.

However, this projected decline in incidence will not result in an immediate decline in reported cases, as there are significant delays between infection and the onset of symptomatic disease and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Hence, routine surveillance data are unlikely to show a decline in cases for some time. However, by directly measuring individuals' contact patterns and estimating the corresponding basic reproduction number, we are able to rapidly quantify the impact of physical distancing on transmission.",

The observed reduction appears to be unlikely due to chance given the large difference in average contacts, and is consistent with a recent study conducted in Wuhan, China that estimated a reduction in the average number contacts per day from 14.6 prior to the outbreak to 2.0 under physical distancing interventions 12 . While we are unaware of any directly comparable data from the UK, our findings are certainly consistent with other reports from the UK of a dramatic reduction in social contacts, with, for example, only half of respondents in one survey reporting having the house at all in the past 24hrs 4 .",

Based on physical contacts only, we estimated R0 to be 0.37 (95% CI = 0.21 -0.52).
