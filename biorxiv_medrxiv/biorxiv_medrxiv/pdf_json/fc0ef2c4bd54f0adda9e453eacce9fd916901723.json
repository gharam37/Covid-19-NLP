While the state of global lockdown is not sustainable, these findings illustrate 40 the potential health benefits gained from reducing \"business as usual\" air pollutant emissions from 41 economic activities. Explore trends here: www.covid-19-pollution.zsv.co.za 42 Significance statement 43 The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented reductions in 44 economic activity. We find that lockdown events have reduced air pollution levels by 45 approximately 20% across 27 countries. The reduced air pollution levels come with a substantial 46 health co-benefit in terms of avoided premature deaths and pediatric asthma cases that 47 accompanied the COVID-19 containment measures. 48 Introduction: 49 In many developing nations economic growth has exacerbated air pollutant emissions with severe 50 consequences for the environment and human health. Long-term exposure to air pollution 51 including fine particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5\u00b5m (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) are 52 estimated to cause ~8.8 million excess deaths annually (1, 2), while nitrogen dioxide (NO2) results 53 in 4 million new paediatric asthma cases annually (3). Despite the apparent global air pollution 54 \"pandemic\", anthropogenic emissions remain on positive trajectories for most developing and 55 some developed nations (4-6). 56 57",

For instance, positive associations have been reported between air 217 pollution and SARS case fatalities in China during 2003 (23) and preliminary analysis has 218 revealed similar patterns for COVID-19 (24, 25). Therefore our estimates may represent lower 219 limits after considering the air pollution reductions as a cofactor in COVID-19 case recoveries. 220 Conclusions: Reducing economic activity to levels equivalent to a lockdown state are impractical, yet 222 maintaining \"business as usual\" clearly exacerbates global pollutant emissions and associated 223 deaths. Our study documents the dramatic short-term effect of global reductions in transport and 224 economic activity on reducing ground-level NO2, with mixed effects on O3 and PM2.5 225 concentrations. Maintaining reductions in pollutant emissions corresponding to lockdown 226 conditions can substantially reduce the global burden of disease.
