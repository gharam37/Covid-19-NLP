We found that imports of goods and services, international tourism and the number of published scientific papers are good predictors of COVID-19 infection rates, indicating that more globalized countries may have experienced multiple and recurrent introductions of the virus. However, high-income countries showed lower mortality rates, suggesting that the consequences of the current pandemic will be worse for globalized low-income countries.

To assess COVID-19 growth rate (hereafter infection rate) and mortality rate, we excluded all records before a country reached a minimum threshold of 100 confirmed cases, as well as countries with less than 10 days of records and less than a total number of 1000 confirmed cases. Additionally, we excluded post-exponential growth records in countries where we observed that growth curves were beginning to flatten (China, South_Korea, Iran, Italy, Spain, United States of America, and Austria; exclusion dates are shown in Script_S1). These stringent filtering criteria ensured we had at least 10 continuous days with confirmed records during the exponential growth-phase, for countries that tested a minimum number of 1000 persons.",

The daily number of confirmed cases was used as the response variable and date as the predictor. The model's coefficient for date was then used as a proxy for infection rate during the exponential growth-phase. Mortality rates for each country were calculated as (Total number of deaths / Total number of cases) x 100. We then excluded observations containing missing data (final sample size was 36 countries) and ran linear multiple regressions with either infection rate or mortality rate as response variables, and all possible combinations of up to three non-correlated predictor variables to avoid overfitting. All climate and socio-economic variables plus latitude were included as predictor variables. Models where constructed using the dredge function from the MuMIn package (Barto\u0144, 2019 ) and a custom script (https://github.com/rojaff/dredge_mc). We then selected the set of best-fitting models using the Akaike Information Criterion (\u0394AIC AIC \u2264 2) and used them to calculate confidence Intervals (CI) for modelaveraged coefficients and sum of Akaike weights. All analyses were performed in R (see Script_S1).",

Since imports of goods and services, international tourism, and the number of scientific articles were highly correlated (Fig. 5) , these three variables seem to be representing how open, globalized or integrated countries are . Our findings thus indicate that globalized countries could have experienced multiple and recurrent introductions of the virus via imported goods, tourists, or international exchanges of students or academics (Anzai et al., 2020; Chinazzi et al., 2020) . Importantly, local climate (represented by mean temperature, precipitation and vapor pressure) was not found associated with infection rates, supporting a recent study (Luo et al., 2020) and contradicting an evaluation from 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China (Shi et al., 2020) and a global analysis (Ficetola & Rubolini, 2020) . The discrepancy between our results and those from Ficetola and Rubolini (2020) may be due to the fact that they calculated exponential growth rates over a period of five days, and assessed a more limited number of predictor variables. Given that we explicitly included the same climatic variables (retrieved from the same source using their described method), and used a larger and more stringent dataset (at least 10 continuous days with confirmed records during the exponential growth-phase, for countries that tested at least 1000 persons), we believe that our statistical analyses should be robust enough to detect an effect of climate should there be one.",

It is not surprising to find higher mortality rates in countries with a larger population of older people, since this was already identified as the most susceptible population (Chen et al., 2020) , and a recent analysis also revealed higher mortality in countries with an older population (Dowd et al., 2020) . On the other hand, countries with higher electric power consumption showed lower mortality rates. Since electric power consumption, GDP per capita, government health expenditure, and Human Capital Index were highly correlated (Fig. 5) , these indicators seem to be proxies for country-level wealth and development (Narayan & Prasad, 2008; Jaffe, 2013) . Our findings thus imply that high-income countries are better placed to face this pandemic, probably due to a higher availability of running water and soap, hospital beds, qualified medical personnel and/or technical equipment. In contrast, low-income countries seem more vulnerable to COVID-19 since they are likely to experience higher mortality rates than countries with better and more accessible services.",
