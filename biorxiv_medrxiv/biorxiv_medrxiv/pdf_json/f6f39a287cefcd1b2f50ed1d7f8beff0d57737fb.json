We used the mathematical model to monitor and predict the changes of viral loads from different nasal and throat swab of clinical specimens collected from diagnosed patients. We also tested this real-time model by using the data from the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with different severity. By using this model (http://58.87.113.187:8080/), we can predict the viral dynamics of patients, minimize false-negative test results, and screen the patients who are at risk of testing positive again after recovery. We sincerely thank those who are on the front lines battling SARS-CoV-2 virus. We hope this model will be useful for SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.",

However, there are many details that remain puzzled. For example, 1) some patients have presented positive chest CT findings showing multifocal ground-glass changes, but they had negative RT-PCR results at that time [5] ; 2) some patients have rapid changes in viral loads during the window of infection, with the RT-PCR results sometimes positive and sometimes negative [2] [3] [4] ; 3) few recovered patients (absence of clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities and .
