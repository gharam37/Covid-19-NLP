It rapidly spread to the majority of the nations by mid-March 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has stirred worldwide havoc with higher infection rates and associated variable adverse outcomes across countries. So far the most affected countries had been the developed West and South European, North American countries along with China and Iran from Asian countries. It had already killed about 60 thousand people by 4 th April 2020 -when the analysis being communicated was planned [1] . With exponentially increasing deaths every passing day, the pandemic has sent the countries and their health services scrambling to decrease the fallout of COVID-19. The dedicated worldwide platforms had been created to provide up-to-date information about the pandemic. The overall recovery rate for COVID-19 had been about 79% making all countries panic to consolidate all resources to decrease the deaths. As of today, 11 th April 2020 the death ascribed to COVID-19 has already crossed the 100 thousand mark [1] . Various clinical trials to repurpose the existing drugs indicated for similar coronavirus or suggested pathology, as well as experimental vaccines, have been initiated/planned [2, 3] . A large number of studies are also being conducted and results published in journals or posted online on preprint servers medRxiv and bioRxiv to understand the basis of differential incidence and fatality rates in different countries. Few studies indicate the existence of a positive correlation between BCG vaccination policies to the inherent resistance of populations to COVID-19 and suggest clinical trials to evaluate its preventive potential in COVID-19 [4, 5] . The data available needs to be analyzed thoroughly to arrive at actionable contextspecific conclusions to ameliorate the devastating effect of COVID-19 on human lives.",

TB remains the top cause of death from a single pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). The vaccination of BCG or exposure to environmental nontuberculous mycobacteria is supposed to 'train' cell-mediated immunity to respond better on subsequent exposure to intracellular pathogen MTB by responding through CD4-and CD8-positive cells and the production of various cytokines including Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) which is also a key cytokine in innate and adaptive immunity against viral and bacterial infections [6, 7] . A more generalized longterm cross-reactive protective effect against several pathogens is suggested through long-term epigenetic programming and 'training' of immune cells particularly Macrophages and NK-cells by this mycobacterial exposure (BCG or environmental). The BCG vaccination has been found to provide protective immunity for a variable duration in different populations ranging from 15 years to 50-60 years [8, 9] . However, it should be noted that in about 90% of the cases MTB gets cleared even in the absence of BCG vaccination or prior 'training' of the immune system. BCG vaccination does not prevent primary infection of MTB, activation of latent TB infection (LTBI) and supposed to have only a limited effect on the prevention of MTB spread in a population [10] . The supposed protective immunity wanes away with time but subsequent exposures to environmental mycobacteria could act as a booster to keep the immunity intact. The exposure to Mycobacterium spp., whether it is MTB, BCG vaccine or environmental isolate, is usually tested by Tuberculin Sensitivity Test (TST) and",

Apparently, better healthcare and hygiene are puzzlingly translating into a higher incidence of COVID-19. Recently, it has been proposed that the earlier implementation of universal BCG policy could be responsible for the lower incidence of COVID-19 [4] . BCG vaccine is generally given to children in high TB prevalence countries to protect them from developing pulmonary TB. Its vaccination is estimated to protect different populations for variable durations ranging from 15 to 60 years [8, 9] . The BCG induced delayed T-cell mediated hypersensitivity is supposed to protect through training the immune system to respond in a more disciplined manner without getting overwhelmed with 'cytokine storm' when exposed to pathogens [7, 12] . When we compared the COVID-19 incidence among different countries with BCG vaccination policy implementation ( Figure 1C ) and the total BCG coverage (Figure 1 D) , they do not seem to affect the COVID-19 confirmed deaths per million population for specific countries (e.g., Australia, USA, Germany). Countries falling in less than 89% BCG coverage regions seemingly display more disparate outcomes concerning coronavirus deaths (e.g., Finland, Sweden, South Africa, Iran, Greenland, Iceland, etc).",

CFR estimates are known to vary by location, phase of the outbreak, screening criteria adopted, the extent of screening, reporting issues -number of cases identified/reported, supporting health care, etc. As the COVID-19 pandemic is still underway, the true CFR cannot be reliably ascertained, rather just guessed to allow us to have some understanding of its evolving epidemiology. The CFR value for COVID -19 had been recently estimated between 0.2% (Germany) to 7.7% (Italy) [13] . To evaluate whether BCG vaccination may be providing a certain degree of protection (correlation again!) against COVID-19 to people in countries reporting high BCG coverage (high TST/IGRA positivity), we calculated the CFR in the same set of countries reporting more than 1000 cases, using definition CFR (in %) = [Total deaths from disease / Total number of cases reported] x 100 and plotted them vs % LTBI (TST/IGRA) positivity ( Figure 2B ). The CFR values ranged from 0.29% to 12.25 % among countries. The countries with lower %LTBI (<13% (6.07-12.97%); total 27) seem to have higher CFR than next 28 countries with higher %LTBI (>13% (13.25-47.64%). However, it should be noted that these lower CFR displaying countries (higher %LTBI) on an average are also supposed to be relatively at an earlier phase of the pandemic (except China) and accounting for <15 % of total deaths (including China) at the moment.

These estimates are required to assess the gravity of the situation. The lowest possible IFR (i-IFR-l) calculation, for the best possible outcome scenario, included both dead and recovered for the total number of cases with outcomes. The highest possible IFR (i-IFR-h) calculation, for the worst possible outcome scenario, considered the critically sick in the dead category (as a possibility) and rest was similar to i-IFR-l calculation. This was done to get a more realistic estimate of the problem for two reasons: currently, we do not have a complete picture of COVID-19's course and an estimate from the Chinese outbreak projects a period of 2 to 8 weeks from the appearance of first symptoms to death [14] . The predicted/projected death rate for COVID-19 under the best possible scenario (i-IFR-l), when all critically sick will recover, ranged from 1.28% (for Iceland) to 96.39% (For UK) while for the worstcase scenario estimate (i-IFR-h), when all critically sick may die, varied from 3.66 % (for S.

Some risk variables such as age, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes have been already identified as associated with adverse outcome in select populations, e.g., Italy, South Korea, Spain, China etc [11, 14] . These potential causative association needs to be verified in other populations as well. The underlying mechanisms responsible for adverse outcome needs to be elucidated and the causes precisely identified for taking any corrective measures to decrease the overall COVID-19 mortality. It would be also interesting to investigate the underlying issues with the reporting, data collection or identify protective contributory factors which may be responsible for such disparate outcomes. Difference in the virulence of virus strain currently affecting different population and the 'training status' of immune system to deal with intracellular pathogens (exposure to mycobacteria/BCG/TST positivity) to mount measured immune response without buckling under the 'cytokine storm' as predicted for SARS-CoV-2 infection, could be some of the other risk factors for select populations/groups.",

The underlying causes of the difference in the fatality rates among different country populations need to be understood. The government agencies may collect and make available more patient specific data pertaining to COVID-19 to allow its closer scrutiny for making better informed decisions. For correlative analysis, Immune Marker Variation/ HLA typing and genetic background information may be already available or readily obtained in the developed countries who are also currently some of the most affected countries with the COVID-19. The studies exploring the correlation of the genetic makeup of the COVID-19 patients (i.e., critical, recovered, deceased, along with asymptomatic and those displaying non-serious symptoms) may be actively promoted or taken up on a priority basis.

We wondered if the rate of LTBI (%) (reported based on TST/IGRA positivity), among different countries (total 55 countries with more than 1000 cases) without any regard for income, healthcare facilities, BCG vaccination policies or BCG coverage, would show a relationship with the numbers of COVID-19 cases per million population. Surprisingly, the number of cases per million showed a decline with an increase in % LTBI (TST/IGRA positivity) with R 2 = 0.6343, suggesting an exponentially negative covariation between the two or in other words higher TST/IGRA positivity could be protecting against COVID-19 or contributing to a slower spread of the COVID-19 as compared to countries with lower TST/IGRA positivity(Figure 2 A). As inherent with any statistical analysis for correlation, the observed correlation cannot be construed as to indicate a cause and effect relationship by default. A more simple explanation for the observed correlation could be the higher frequency of people's movement between the countries currently having a high burden of COVID-19 and the country of COVID-19 origin.

Analysis of case fatality rate (CFR) and interim Infection fatality rate (i-IFR) for countries was made (Supplementary File: Sheet 'Top 20bottom 80% contributors' and Figure 3). The calculated CFR and i-IFR values for the top 20% countries are presented in tabular form as Figure 3A (for the bottom 80% contributors refer Supplementary File: Sheet 'Top 20-bottom 80% contributors'). Though higher TST/IGRA positivity (LTBI) could be argued to cause lower total COVID 19 cases per million (compare high %LTBI countries Iran and China with other nations with lower %LTBI population), the death rate per million population comparison seems to make the association murkier. A closer examination of the table indicates against any possible broadly applicable protective contribution of high % TST/IGRA positivity (LTBI) to overall CFRs for COVID-19 in respective countries. For example countries with lower %LTBI and no BCG vaccination policy or coverage such as Germany (CFR=1.40%), USA (CFR=2.67%) and Switzerland (CFR=3.01%) have their CFRs lower than China (CFR=4.07%) or Iran (CFR=6.19%) which have both BCG policy and coverage in place as well as higher %LTBI.",

It did not escape our attention that different groupings of countries can still be made to show a possible positive correlation between LTBI (TST/IGRA positivity) percentages of the country population with lower COVID-19 severity.",
