The first epi-center of its' massive spread was in Wuhan, Hubei province, China having a temperate weather, but the spread has got an unprecedented momentum in European temperate countries mainly in Italy and Spain (as of March 30, 2020). However, Malaysia and Singapore and the neighboring tropical countries of China got relatively low spread and fatality that created a research interest on whether there are potential impacts of weather condition on COVID-19 spread. Adopting the SIR (Susceptible Infected Removed) deviated model to predict potential cases and death in the coming days from COVID-19 was done using the secondary and official sources of data. This study shows that COVID-19 spread and fatality tend to be high across the world but compared to tropical countries, it is going to be incredibly high in the temperate countries having lower temperature (7-16\u00b0C) and humidity (80-90%) in last March. However, some literature predicted that this might not to be true, rather irrespective of weather conditions there might be a continuous spread and death. Moreover, a large number of asymptotic COVID-19 carrier in both temperate and tropical countries may re-outbreak in the coming winter. Therefore, a comprehensive global program with the leadership of WHO for testing of entire population of the world is required, which will be very useful for the individual states to take proper political action, social movement and medical services.",

However, growth rate of conformed cases and fatalities are apparently slower in Asian tropical countries (like Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand etc.) than that of European temperate countries (10). This gap might be due to tropical countries with moderate economy are tended to be resource poor, not capable to do regular testing or there might be an impact of tropical weather to reduce the pandemic nature COVID-19, rather be a panic. A number of studies (11,12) argued that higher temperature and high relative humidity reduce the spreading capacity of new coronavirus to a greater extent, while there it would be popped again in 2020-2021 winter season (13). Researchers along with epidemiological experts also predicting COVID-19 cannot take advantage and bridgehead in the tropics than in the world's temperate regions (14) .

Actual forecasting like \"How many people will be affected onset by the following days\" or \"The outbreak going to be peak or not in the coming month?\" of an epidemic disease from a transmission dynamics based model is quite tough (33). This is because the transmission dynamics based model is developed foothold on the official clinical surveillance data, which comes through a bureaucratic reporting chain of public health officials and government employees (34) who have to maintain privacy concern owing to geographical resolutions. Moreover, human (host) social behavior (35), potential changes in the pathogen (36) and host-pathogen interaction (37) dominates the epidemic models to a greater extent, while these are continuously change within an epidemic period. In case of COVID-19 the prediction from this study can be rippled for being down warding the basic reproduction value, which is already slowed from 2.9 to 2.4 (26) and also of the fatality rate which must be slow downed on the coming days for taking effective measure by the affected countries.",
