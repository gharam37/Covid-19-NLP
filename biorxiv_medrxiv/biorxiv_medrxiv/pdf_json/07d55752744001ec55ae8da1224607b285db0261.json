We project death rates at various spatial scales by applying data on agespecific fatality rates to the area's population by age and sex. Our analysis shows a significant variation in the projected death rates between the constituent countries of the UK, between its regions and within regions. First, Scotland and Wales have higher projected fatality levels from Covid-19 than England, whereas Northern Ireland has lower rate. Second, the infection fatality rates are projected to be substantially higher in small towns and rural areas than those in large urban areas. Third, our analysis shows that within urban regions there are also 'pockets' of high projected death rates. Overall, the areas with high and low fatality rates tend to cluster because of the high residential separation of different population age-groups in the UK. Our analysis also reveals that the Welsh-, Gaelic-and Cornish-speaking communities with relatively old populations are likely to experience heavy population losses if the virus spreads widely across the UK.",

The most recent data show that there are 2.1 million reported cases and more than 139 thousand deaths in the World (1) . Studies show that hospital admissions and deaths from Covid-19 significantly vary across population subgroups; severe illness and deaths are more likely to occur among those with underlying health conditions including respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, but also cardiovascular disease and diabetes (2) . Unsurprisingly, the hospital admissions and deaths from Covid-19 exhibit a distinct age pattern (3) . The infection fatality rates (IFR) are very low among young, they increase with age and are the highest among those in their eighties. The estimates of the IFR significantly vary across studies; some studies show that as many as a fifth of the oldest population die if infected, other studies report lower levels (4, 5) . The main issue has been the lack of information on the risk population (or the denominator); the virus testing levels vary by countries, further while there are some estimates on symptomatic cases, the number of asymptomatic cases, i.e. individuals who carry the virus, but exhibit no symptoms are not detected and reported (5) .",

            "text": "Countries with older populations are likely to observe higher hospitalisation and mortality rates than those with young populations during the Covid-19 pandemic (6) . Although many factors may influence mortality levels from Covid-19 such as well-functioning healthcare system and various prevention measures (e.g. social distancing), a recent study has shown that more than a half of the variation in mortality rates across countries comes from the differences in the population age structure (7) . Population age structure varies across countries, but even more within countries across regions. Hence, with the same infection rate mortality levels are expected to be much higher in regions with old populations (e.g. rural areas) than in areas where young populations dominate (e.g. urban areas); further significant differences in the population age structure may also exist within (e.g. urban) regions. A recent study from the UK shows a substantial spatial polarisation between young and old age groups (8) . Further the residential separation increases with age, with the highest spatial separation found among those aged 80 and older. This is not surprising as the age is an important determinant of residential choice and location and the concentration of the oldest groups in retirement and nursing homes and communities are well-known pattern in high-income countries. Interestingly, however, residential separation between older and younger generations has risen rapidly in the past three decades in the UK with emerging clusters of the oldest-old population (i.e. aged 85 and older) (8) . Although the spatial segregation between the young and the old may limit the spread of the virus within the UK, it is simultaneously clear that it will certainly make some communities much more vulnerable to Covid-19 pandemic than others.",

We apply the same age-specific fatality rates by sex to all geographical units in the country. We use the IFRs obtained from the study by Ferguson et al. on the UK, which, in turn, are based on the analysis of Covid-19 mortality in China by Verity et al (5, 10) . We calculate age-specific fatality rates by sex using the latest data on observed deaths by sex in Great Britain (11) 1 . Although Ferguson et al. show lower overall IFR (i.e. 0.9%) than that estimated by many other studies including the estimates by the WHO, they have been adjusted to underascertainment (as much as this is possible). Many studies divide the deaths from Covid-19 to reported cases, which significantly over-estimate the IFR. We assume a uniform infection rate, and use the values of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 in our calculations for total deaths. Although there are significant differences in the infection rate across geographical units, especially in the beginning of the spread of infection diseases, we assume that many people will be infected by the virus in the long-term, either during the first wave or possible subsequent waves, which are likely to follow within a year or two. The idea is consistent with the findings of the studies on the Spanish flu from 1918 to 1920, which have shown that many countries experienced two or even more waves of the virus before the majority of a population became immune (12) (13) (14) . Further our main task is to identify areas where people are at high risk because of their characteristics (i.e. old age) and to inform policy-makers with the aim to find the ways of reducing transmission of the virus to these communities.",

This figure is very large, but within the same magnitude as the estimates based on a microsimulation model by Ferguson et al., which predicts 510 thousand deaths in Great Britain (for the 'do-nothing' scenario) (10) . With infection rates of 0.4 and 0.2 the projected number of deaths in the UK are 320 and 160 thousands, accordingly. Although the UK has witnessed a significant increase in the number of deaths from Covid-19 in the recent two weeks, our projected figures still look very large in comparison to the current number of deaths, which is 13,729 (16/04/20) (1) . This suggest that either the virus is still much less spread in the total population than believed (28) or that even our conservative (i.e. relatively low) infection fatality rates substantially overestimate the number of deaths. Therefore, in what follows next, we will report the relative distribution of deaths and relative fatality rates in our comparisons as these are immune to the total number of deaths (unless the infection fatality rates by age change significantly).",

Their number increases significantly by age and those in their seventies form the largest group of individuals requiring hospitalisation. The distribution of individuals requiring critical care and deaths are even more shifted toward older age groups. Very few individuals younger than age 50 need critical care or are expected to die from Covid-19; most critical care cases and deaths occur among those in their seventies, eighties and nineties -these form 72% of the critical care cases and 71% of the total deaths. .

We see that Scotland and Wales have higher projected hospitalisation rates than England (the comparison group), whereas the rates are substantially lower in Northern Ireland. Largely similar picture emerges when we compare the expected number of deaths from Covid-19. Scotland exhibits 3% and Wales as much as 12% higher fatality rate than England; Northern Ireland has 9% lower rate. These differences reflect significant differences in the population age structure across the UK's countries. Clearly, Northern Ireland has the youngest age structure, whereas Scotland and Wales have the oldest. The current population age-structures reflect the past demographic processes in each of the four countries. Until the turn of the century, Scotland experienced significant out-migration of young adults; fertility levels have been lower than in England for decades and the country has received fewer international migrants (29, 30) . Significant out-migration and low immigration also explain a relatively old population structure in Wales. In contrast, Northern Ireland has long experienced substantially higher fertility levels that the rest of the UK and thus has a markedly younger population. ",

Relatively high fatality rates are projected in large areas of South-West England (in Devon and Cornwall, also in Somerset and Dorset), in Central and North Wales and in Northern England (Cumbria, Northumbria and North Yorkshire). Interestingly, the expected death rates are also high in some coastal areas of East and South-East England (e.g. Norfolk and Sussex) showing the spatial clustering of old (and very old) population.

Figure 3 displays the clusters of relatively high (and also low) fatality rates based on the values of the local Moran's I statistics. Clearly, we observe high fatality rates in a number of larger regions in England, Wales and Scotland we already discussed above; the analysis also reveals many 'pockets' with high fatality rates within the areas of relatively low death rates.

However, there are also areas with relatively high infection fatality rates in the London region, especially in several boroughs on the edge of the city region including Bromley and Croydon in the South, Havering in the East and parts of Hillingdon, Harrow and Barnet in the North. Figure 4b shows projected relative infection death rates in East of England. Again, we see significant variation within the region. There are pockets with expected high and low fatality rates in the Southwestern part of the region (e.g. Essex and Cambridgeshire), whereas the Eastern part of the region (counties of Norfolk and Suffolk), especially the seaside communities have relative high expected infection fatality rates, suggesting a high concentration of old population in these areas.",

The analysis shows that most deaths are expected to occur in urban areas; this is not surprising as the majority of the UK's population lives in cities (Table 2) . However, a different picture emerges when we calculate the number of expected deaths relative to the population size. The projected death rates from Covid-19 are significantly higher in small towns and rural settlements.

If the virus is to spread widely to remote communities in the Scottish Highlands and Islands, Central and North Wales and Cornwall with relatively old populations, the Welsh-, Gaelic-and Cornish-speaking populations are projected to experience heavy population losses, which in the case of the two latter groups may challenge the very existence of these unique linguistic communities with long histories.",

In the long-run the assumption of a uniform infection rate can be assumed for Covid-19 unless regional lockdowns are introduced, or the vaccine becomes rapidly available. We have also conducted series of robustness checks to test sensitivity of the results to different assumptions on age-specific fatality rates. Following research by Verity et al. we conducted projections with slightly higher and slightly lower IFRs rates (5) .

Relevant public health agencies in the UK should follow the example and provide data on the number of reported infections and hospitalised people cross-classified by age, sex and area at minimum (e.g. clinical commissioning group or health board). Access to disaggregated data would allow scientific community to rapidly respond to the challenges by estimating the spread of the virus and by conducting data-based predictions on infected people, hospitalisations and deaths, which is much needed in the rapidly changing circumstances.
