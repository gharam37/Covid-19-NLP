Other studies report that some subjects have significant viral shedding prior to symptom onset. Since both asymptomatic and presymptomatic subjects can spread the disease, identifying such individuals is critical for effective control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase diagnostic testing capabilities in order to also screen asymptomatic carriers. In fact, such tests will be routinely required until a vaccine is developed. Yet, a major bottleneck of managing the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries is diagnostic testing, due to limited laboratory capabilities as well as limited access to genome-extraction and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) reagents. We developed P-BEST -a method for Pooling-Based Efficient SARS-CoV-2 Testing, using a non-adaptive grouptesting approach, which significantly reduces the number of tests required to identify all positive subjects within a large set of samples. Instead of testing each sample separately, samples are pooled into groups and each pool is tested for SARS-CoV-2 using the standard clinically approved PCRbased diagnostic assay. Each sample is part of multiple pools, using a combinatorial pooling strategy based on compressed sensing designed for maximizing the ability to identify all positive individuals. We evaluated P-BEST using leftover samples that were previously clinically tested for COVID-19. In our current proof-of-concept study we pooled 384 patient samples into 48 pools providing an 8-fold increase in testing efficiency. Five sets of 384 samples, containing 1-5 positive carriers were screened and all positive carriers in each set were correctly identified. P-BEST provides an efficient and easy-to-implement solution for increasing testing capacity that will work with any clinically approved genome-extraction and PCR-based diagnostic methodologies.",

Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that a positive sample can be detected even within a pool of 128 subjects, which would allow efficient testing of >1000 samples. P-BEST is optimized for efficiently testing populations with low carrier frequencies (1.3% in this case). It is therefore best suited for screening asymptomatic populations that are not at high risk of being infected, excluding for example subjects who were in close contact with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. Importantly, if the carrier frequency is above 1.3%, P-BEST will lose efficiency, but in turn may help identifying SARS-CoV-2 hotspots.

However, P-BEST was still able to correctly identify all positive subjects within each of the sample sets. We note that this reduction will not occur when P-BEST will be implemented on fresh samples collected directly into lysis buffer, per our current experimental protocol. To further address the sensitivity issues we propose to (1) modify the sample collection protocol to collect samples directly into lysis buffer, thereby increasing the initial concentration of RNA in the collected samples; and (2) Test P-BEST pooled samples using the SeeGene SARS-CoV-2 PCR kit, that also includes primers for the NP SARS-COV-2 gene, which in our preliminary experiments had higher sensitivity as compared to the other genes included in the kit, and was positive even when diluting a single positive sample into a pool of 120 subjects (Supplemental Figure 1A) .",

The average RNA concentration was 15ng/\u00b5l, with standard deviation of 7ng/\u00b5l (Supplemental Figure 1B) . These values were used in our simulations. A second possible source of noise is due to PCR amplification, which may fail in a certain number of pools. Supplemental To assess the effects of variations in RNA levels, we measured the average number of false positive and false negative detections as a function of the true number of carriers across 3000 simulations in two scenarios: (1) No noise in RNA levels (black square) and (2) RNA noise based on the measured variation of RNA levels across 48 samples (see Supplemental Figure 1B ). The false positive (left panel) and false negative (right panel) detection rates for the two scenarios show that RNA variation does not significantly degrade P-BEST performance.

For example, P-BEST reports exactly two samples when simulating two carriers, and retrieves an average of ~7.4 samples when the simulated set containing five carriers. (b) The average number of true positives, false negatives and false positives identified for a given number of simulated carriers.
