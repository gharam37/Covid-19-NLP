At present, confirmatory diagnosis is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), typically taking several hours and requiring a molecular laboratory to perform. There is an urgent need for rapid, simplified and cost-effective detection methods. We have developed and analytically validated a protocol for direct rapid extraction-free PCR (DIRECT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for nucleic acid purification. As few as 6 RNA copies per reaction of viral nucleocapsid (N) gene from respiratory samples such as sputum and nasal exudate can be detected directly using our one-step inhibitor-resistant assay. The performance of this assay was validated on a commercially available portable PCR thermocycler. Viral lysis, reverse transcription, amplification and detection are achieved in a single-tube homogeneous reaction within 36 minutes. This minimized hands-on time, reduces turnaround-time for sample-to-result and obviates the need for RNA purification reagents. It could enable wider use of Covid-19 testing for diagnosis, screening and research in countries and regions where laboratory capabilities are limiting.",

This allowed several laboratories around the world, including our laboratory, to develop nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) to detect SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials (9) . Currently, there are many quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) based NAAT being developed for SARS-CoV-2 (10). These target various viral genes including the nucleocapsid (N), polyprotein (ORF1ab), spike (S) and envelope (E) gene region of the positively stranded 29.9 kb RNA virus. These tests are widely used to screen suspected Covid-19 patients, returning travelers from outbreak areas, close contacts of cases, and healthy individuals who may be asymptomatic carriers of the virus (5, 11) . Typically, respiratory samples such as sputum or nasal, throat, nasopharyngeal swabs collected consecutively over two days are tested to confirm a diagnosis or to confirm recovery. (5) . Diagnostic testing is recognized as a rate-limiting step, and there is a global need to ramp up laboratory capacity, in both well-developed and low-income countries (4, 12) . This is worsened by the possibility that asymptomatic individuals in the community could transmit infection, hence increasing the need to screen healthy individuals or those with mild symptoms (13) (14) (15) .",

However, there are several technical challenges. These tests require RNA extraction, followed by amplification and detection. Current state-of-art PCR typically require 70 minutes for RNA extraction and a further 90 minutes for amplification (15, 16) . Highly trained technical staff, costly equipment (costing USD 20K -50K) and facilities are required. These factors contribute to longer turnaround-time, costs of manpower, capital and consumables as well as risks of carryover contamination and biosafety risks when handling clinical samples. There is a limited supply of extraction reagents and test kits worldwide (16, 17) . In addition, asymptomatic individuals have also led to pre-symptomatic transmission in the community which further increases demand for laboratory testing (13) . These factors have motivated us to explore ways to simplify and shorten the protocols, without significant compromise to the high sensitivity and specificity of RT-qPCR. We therefore propose a novel method, which we termed direct rapid extraction-free PCR (DIRECT-PCR) for Covid-19 diagnosis.",

When the cycling conditions were optimized in our fast DIRECT-PCR with small reaction volumes (10 \u00b5L), and shorter RT and annealing durations, we were able to amplify SARS-CoV-2 in less than an hour (Fig. 3) . Furthermore, there are cost savings on nucleic acid extraction kits, and the availability of reagents themselves may be limiting when laboratory capacity is ramped up and demand is increased globally. Moreover, DIRECT-PCR is a single-tube homogeneous reaction that reduces hands-on time and biosafety risk for laboratory personnel, as well as the likelihood for carryover contamination. One caveat however for fast DIRECT-PCR of samples with low viral load is that of sampling error, since only 1 \u00b5L of sample is used. Nucleic acid extractions, on the other hand, serve to concentrate RNA from typical sample volumes of 150-300 \u00b5L, although their yield can also be low and variable. Hence, where samples are expected to have low counts near to the limit of detection, DIRECT-PCR with larger volume reactions (25 \u00b5L) to include higher template volume may be necessary to reduce risk of false negatives.",

While we have focused our DIRECT-PCR protocols on commonly used primer-probe sets developed by the China CDC and US CDC that target the SARS-CoV-2 N gene as well as ORF1ab gene and the internet control RP (data not shown), we expect direct PCR to be similarly useful for other viral primer targets and PCR amplicons developed for Covid-19 (8, 9) , as well as for multiplexed amplification of several targets in the same tube. Nevertheless, there may be other inhibitors of PCR that were not present in our samples that we tested, and clinical validation with a larger series is needed to exclude this possibility.",

The nasal viral load has been shown to peak within days of symptom onset according to small study of throat and nasal swabs from 17 patients (29) . Using RNA as template, our DIRECT-PCR assay has a dynamic range of over 7 orders of magnitude with mean Cq range from 17 to 38, indicating it is reproducibly quantitative over a wide range, including very high viral titers.

This variability would be even more significant in a clinical setting, with the added confounding factors such as type of sample, sampling method, dilution in transport buffers, duration and conditions of storage, and the reagents and protocols for RNA extraction, that are difficult to standardize across healthcare settings and laboratories. While removing the RNA extraction step could help to reduce this variability in RNA yield and quality, variability in sample type and sampling procedure still renders the entire assay nonquantitative. Hence, we caution over-interpretation of Cq values, especially in the absence of in-house quality control and calibration data for each combination of protocol, reagents and thermocycler. These technical factors may also partly explain some of the false negatives and temporal variability in viral RNA shedding reported in various studies, that use fixed criteria Cq < 37 for positive, Cq between 37 to 40 as inconclusive for repeat testing and Cq > 40 as negative. In fact, our data demonstrates that as viral RNA concentrations approach the threshold of detection, our assay LoD has Cq mean value of > 37 and may exceed 40 (Table 1 ). Since negative controls in these probe-based assays remain consistently negative, it should be possible to report Cq > 37 as positive. Hence to achieve better standardization of quantitative results, we propose that instead of reporting Cq, laboratories may report the equivalent viral copy number in per unit sample volume, derived from running serial dilutions of viral or RNA controls in-house.",

There are many real-time fieldable thermocyclers available, that are smaller, portable and less costly than benchtop ones, and three of these we have evaluated perform similar to benchtop ones (data not shown). While the optical detection modules and their fluorescence sensitivity vary between designs, the overall sensitivity of our assay was similar in both types of thermocyclers tested (Table 1) . Thermocycling parameters could also be optimized for rapidity (Fig. 3) . As the need to transport samples to central laboratories could prolong the availability of test results to beyond 24 hours (16), use of portable thermocyclers, coupled with appropriate training and quality control procedures, could allow the use of RT-qPCR nearer to the patients and in primary healthcare settings. Such rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use at community level were identified by a WHO expert group as a key research priority (30).

DIRECT-PCR for Covid-19 could address the specific requirements and challenges of delivering molecular genetic testing at the POC setting. POC diagnostics could play an important role in the detection, diagnosis and control of this pandemic (17) , such as for more timely diagnosis in primary healthcare facilities, and to complement realtime fever surveillance and screening. Several technologies have been proposed and used to enable molecular testing at POC, including isothermal amplification methods that do not require such thermocyclers, like loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) (12). However, given the widespread validation of existing SARS-CoV-2 PCR primer/probe sets, as well as the likely need to modify amplification primers and probes as the viral sequences evolve in the future, we argue that performing PCR using our DIRECT-PCR method is a more generic and adaptable approach.",
