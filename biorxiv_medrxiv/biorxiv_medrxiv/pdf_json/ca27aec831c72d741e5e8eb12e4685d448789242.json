Detecting viral RNAs on nasopharyngeal and throat swabs is 53 the standard approach for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis with variable success. Currently, there are only a few 54 studies describing the serological diagnostic methods that involve the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific 55 IgM and IgG. Here, we aimed to develop a more quantitative and sensitive serological test for COVID-56 19 diagnosis, monitoring and clinical investigation, based on the detection of antigen-specific IgA as 57 well as IgM and IgG in blood in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. 58 59 Methods 60 In this investigation, we report the development of a set of validated diagnostic kits for detecting serum 61 IgA, IgM, and IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) and receptor-binding domain 62 (RBD) of the spike protein by chemi-luminescence immuno-analysis. The kits were tested with a cohort 63 of 216 sera from 87 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, and 483 sera from SARS-CoV-2 negative 64 or healthy individuals as negative controls. A standard receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis 65 was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy. Using the kits, serum levels of IgA, IgM, and IgG 66 were analyzed, in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 pathogenesis.",

Our data (supplementary figure 2) showed RBD-based diagnostic kits were better 312 performed than that of NP in detecting all the three types of antibodies. A few previous studies reported 313 that RBD-based IgM and IgG detection is better than NP once a comparison was made 19, 23 , and the 314 measurement is agreeable with the titers measured by virus neutralization assays 23, 24 . We provided here 315 the evidence that RBD as an immobilized antigen is also better than NP in detection serum IgA from 316 COVID-19 patients. The exact mechanisms of difference between the use of two types of viral antigens 317 remain to be resolved. It could be that the NP as a highly basic protein interacts with acidic residues in 318 complementarity determining region in antibodies is less specific. It could also be due to the fact that the 319 NP antigen is expressed in bacteria as most investigators do, and the RBD protein we used is expressed 320 in a human cell line enabling critical glycosylation and high-affinity binding to antibodies raised in 321 COVID-19 patients. Nonetheless, we showed that our serological kits based on SARS-CoV-2 spike 322 protein RBD as an immobilized antigen provide a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting IgA, IgM, 323 and IgG in a quantitative manner.",

Serum antibody levels in three distinct severity groups of COVID-19 patients; mild: 25 sera 560 from 9 patients; moderate: 135 sera from 56 patients; and severe: 56 sera from 22 patients (see methods 561 for clinical classifications and supplemental Figure 5 for age distributions). Antibody levels in serum 562 samples were collected from confirmed patients at 4 -41 days post illness onset and presented as scatter 563 plots. For IgA (A), levels in mild, moderate and severe patients were sequentially increased (p values 564 indicated). Results for IgM are shown in B. For IgG (C), levels in moderate and severe patients were 565 significantly higher than mild patients.",

Comprehensive data of RBD specific IgA, IgG, 145 and IgM antibody levels in 216 serum samples of 87 COVID-19 patients and 483 negative controls are Patients and clinical samples This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC (approval number: 2020-XG(H)-014) and the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (approval number: Quick-PJ 2020-04-16). Patient information is listed in 153 supplementary table 1. Confirmed COVID-19 cases and clinical classifications were defined according to the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (7th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China. This study enrolls a total of 87 cases of confirmed COVID-19 patients, who were 157 admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC Hospital or the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University between Jan 26 and Mar 5, 2020. Their blood samples were collected during routine 159 clinical testing. All enrolled cases were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 by use of a standard RT-qPCR assay on throat swab samples from the respiratory tract. For all of the enrolled patients, the 161 date of illness onset, clinical classifications of severity, RNA testing results during the hospitalization 162 period, and the personal demographic information, were obtained from the clinical records.Among them, five patients were admitted to the ICU, one was died of cerebral hemorrhage after stroke.Twenty-two patients had severe COVID-19, and all of whom required oxygen supplementation. Fiftysix patients had moderate and nine patients had mild COVID-19. The median age of patients was 48 years (range 21-91), and the average age of patients was 47.4 years.
