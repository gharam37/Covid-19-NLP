To circumvent surges of TB cases, several studies have been carried out analyzing the determinants of TB incidence and recommended policy measures based on the significant indicators. Although the determinants were suggested for strategic planning of TB, the implementation of new measures was either unsuccessful or difficult to realize because of logistical, administrative, and financial constraints. This study aims to unravel potential determinants of TB incidence across 23 countries in East Asia and Pacific. The disentangling of possible association between variables was carried out using panel regression analysis.",

The single outcome variable of this study was TB incidence which is the estimated number of new and relapse tuberculosis cases arising in a given year, expressed as the rate per 100,000 population.

The study suggests how an increase in unemployment consequently increases TB incidence across the countries. Proper implementation of programs that could promote proper hygiene is essential to increase adherence of people to basic sanitation practices. Based on the study, this is an important factor in mitigating higher incidence of TB. Therefore, strategies may be formulated to either maintain or improve this determinant in order to significantly reduce TB cases. Finally,",

The NTP has the mandate to develop TB control policies, standards and guidelines, formulate the national strategic plan, manage program logistics, provide leadership and technical assistance to the lower health offices/units, manage data, and monitor and evaluate the program. The program's TB diagnostic and treatment protocols and strategies are in accordance with the global strategy of STOP TB partnership and the policies of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Standards for TB Care (ISTC). The overarching strategy of the NTP is the DOTS or Direct Observed Treatment Short Course that was started in the country in 1996. This was expanded under the WHO-endorsed STOP TB strategy that the country adopted from 2006-2010. In, 2010, DOH issued the 2010-2016 Philippine Plan of Action to Control TB (PhilPACT) as the roadmap for controlling TB. However, Yadav et al.
