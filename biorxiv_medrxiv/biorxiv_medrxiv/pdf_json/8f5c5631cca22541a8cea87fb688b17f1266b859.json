Currently, research groups around the globe are trying to figure out such transmission dynamics using different scientific and technological approaches. One of those is by using mathematical and computational models like the compartmental model or the agent-based models. In this paper, a general agent-based model, called INFEKTA, that combines the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease with agents (individuals) that can move on a complex network of accessible places defined over a Euclidean space representing a real town or city is proposed. The applicability of INFEKTA is shown by modeling the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 in Bogot\u00e1 city, the capital of Colombia.",

Demographic information from nineteen districts of Bogot\u00e1 (only urban districts) is used for generating in the Euclidean space interest places (Work-places (W), markets (M), and schools (S)), homes (H), and peple(P). Places are generated, in each one of the districts, following a 2D multivariate normal distribution (\u00b5 is the geographic center and \u03c3 is the covariance matrix defined by the points determining the perimeter of the district). The number of places in the district is based on population density. Table 1 shows the amount of data generated for each type of place and people, also the number of TM stations (Bus), and terminal transportation we use in the simulation. Figure 2a shows the virtual Euclidean map of Bogot\u00e1 with districts and interest places, and Figure 2b shows its associated complex network of connected places (routes) drawn with Gephi [4] .

Figure 4 shows the initial configuration of virtual individuals in the simulation, represented as small points. All of them are initially assigned to homes, and almost all of them are in the Susceptible state (S) (green points). Just ten (10) individuals are considered at state Exposed (E). Figure 5 shows the state of the COVID19 dynamics (propagation of the virus) at three different simulation time steps. Figure 5a shows such dynamics some simulated minutes after starting the simulation. Notice that, individuals are moving (mainly using Transmilenio) according to the routine assigned. Figure 5b shows the COVID19 dynamics after 150 simulated hours. At this time, all individuals have been Exposed (yellow points), some are seriously infected (red points), and few are recovered (blue points). Figure 5c shows the COVID19 dynamics after 300 simulated hours. Notice that, almost all individuals have been recovered (blue points) and some of them are critically infected (dark-red point). It is clear that without social separation policy, the number of exposed, seriously and critical infected cases grow exponentially.

When using an agent-based model, several different characteristics can be modeled, for example, the demographic information of the population being studied, the set of places and the mobility of agents in the city or town under consideration, social separation rules that may be enforced, and the special characteristics of the infectious disease being modeled. INFEKTA is a general agent-based model that allows researches to combine and study all of those characteristics.",
