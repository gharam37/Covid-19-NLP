The method involves fitting a stochastic version of Susceptible Exposed Infected Recovered model, and using the model to calculate the probability that the number of both exposed and infected individuals is equal to 0. The model is used to predict the current probabilities for all District Health Boards in New Zealand. These probabilities are highly correlated with the number of days with no new cases of COVID-19.",

We denote by E t and I t the number of presymptomatic and infectious people on day t, and by \u2206E t and \u2206I t the number of people becoming presymptomatic or infectious. We do not have data on these variables, so we assume they are hidden to us and we will infer their values. On the other hand, we denote by \u2206R t , the number of people being reported as a new case on day t, and we assume that this observed number corresponds to the amount of people moving to state R where they no longer infect others (as they become fully isolated). Thus in the presented model the cases reported correspond to individuals moving to state R rather than I as typically assumed, because we assume that the individuals are more likely to infect others when they are unaware that they have COVID-19, rather than after diagnosis when they become particularly careful. Indeed, James et al. recently wrote that the control measures that specifically target confirmed cases, such as isolation, \"could be modelled by a larger reduction in transmission rates for confirmed cases\" [3] . Here we for simplicity assume that this transmission rate is reduced to 0.",

The lower value of a rate with which individuals become infected \u03b2 than the rate in which cases are reported \u03b3 corresponds to the decreasing number of cases over this period.

This probability is highly correlated with the number of days with no new cases, also given in Table 1 (r = 0.90, p < 0.01). This relationship is also illustrated in Figure 3 . This relationship is not perfect, for example, the estimate for Whanganui is 44% despite only a single day with no cases, because this most recent case was preceded by 14 days with no cases in this DHB. In agreement with occurrence of cases after such long delays, even the regions without cases for 16 or 17 days have the probability estimate around 90% (rather than 100%). Two most right columns of Table 1 also list the probabilities computed with values of \u03b2 differing form that estimated (and \u03b3 set to preserve the difference between estimated \u03b3 and \u03b2). These probabilities do not differ much, suggesting that the computation of these probabilities is robust to the biases in parameter estimates ( Figure 2 ).",

Second, the model assumed that once individuals become diagnosed, they are isolated, and no longer infect others. This assumption may also be not satisfied in practice. Third, the model assumes that there is no movement of individuals between DHB while some of the DHB (e.g. Auckland and Waitemata) include districts of the same city (e.g. Auckland), so the assumptions on travel of individuals between DHB could to be included to refine the model.",
