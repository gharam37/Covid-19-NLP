Plenty of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic knowledges have been enriched from clinical studies since December 2019. However, animal models, particularly non-human primate models, are urgently needed for critical questions that could not be answered in clinical patients, evaluations of anti-viral drugs and vaccines. In this study, two families of non-human primates, old world monkeys (12 Macaca mulatta, 6 Macaca fascicularis) and new world monkeys (6 Callithrix jacchus), were experimentally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Clinical signs were recorded. Samples were collected for analysis of viral shedding, viremia and histopathological examination. Increased body temperature was observed in 100% (12/12) M. mulatta, 33.3% (2/6) M. fascicularis and none (0/6) of C. jacchus post inoculation of SARS-CoV-2. All of M. mulatta and M. fascicularis showed chest radiographic abnormality. Viral genomes were detected in nasal swabs, throat swabs, anal swabs and blood from all 3 species of monkeys. Viral shedding from upper respiratory reached the peak between day 6 and day 8 post inoculation. From necropsied M. mulatta and M. fascicularis, tissues showing virus positive were mainly lung, weasand, bronchus and spleen. No viral genome was seen in any of tissues from 2 necropsied C. jacchus. Severe gross lesions and histopathological changes were observed in lung, heart and stomach of SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. In summary, we have established a NHP model for COVID-19, which could be used to evaluate drugs and vaccines, and investigate viral pathogenesis. M. mulatta is the most susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection, followed by M. fascicularis and C. jacchus. One Sentence Summary: M. mulatta is the most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to M. fascicularis and C. jacchus. : bioRxiv preprint COVID-19 model, two families including 3 species of non-human primates, which are widely used for animal models with their own advantages and disadvantages, were experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2, followed by comparisons of clinical symptoms, hematology, biochemical indexes, immunology and histopathology among 3 species. We found that both Macaca mulatta (M. mulatta) and Macaca fascicularis (M. fascicularis) of old world monkeys were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, although M. mulatta was more susceptible to viral infection than M. fascicularis. However, : bioRxiv preprint SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, as the model of COVID-19, M. mulatta and M. fascicularis may be chosen for further exploration of viral pathogenesis, evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and vaccines.",

Twenty-three parameters of whole blood in BCT were assayed, related to white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC) and platelets. BCT results showed a slight and irregular changes during infection, which indicated no clinical meaning. In BCA, three parameters of PT-R, PT-T, PT-INR progressively decreased with infection, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect blood coagulation function (data not shown). Three major populations of immune cells in RBC-depleted peripheral blood were differentially and dynamically analyzed via flow cytometry. In M mulatta, regardless of ages, frequencies of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, monocytes peaked on 2 or 4 dpi, and then gradually declined. Young M mulatta showed the strongest B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection among 3 ages of monkeys, but they had the similarly changing trends (peaked on 2 or 4 dpi and maintained at a certain level) (Figure 4A). M. fascicularis showed the similar dynamics of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells and monocytes in blood post SARS-CoV-2 infection, of which no significant difference between male and female animals (Figure 4B).

On 30 dpi, we still observed that antibody levels in 2 M. mulatta (one adult HHH-6 and one old HHH-11) and one M. fascicularis (adult female SXH-6) kept increasing (data not shown). One of old M. mulatta hadn't produce detectable virus-specific antibody within 21 days of experiment. However, young M. mulatta showed overall lower levels of virus-specific antibodies compared with those in adult and old M. mulatta. Adult M. fascicularis gave the comparable or slightly higher levels of antibodies than young M. mulatta. No difference of antibody level was noted between SARS-CoV-2 infected male and female M. fascicularis (Figure 4D). We couldn't detect virus-specific antibodies in serum samples from infected C. jacchus probably due to lack of cross-reactivity of antibody detection kit with samples from C. jacchus. Furthermore, host inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed via non-human primate multiplex inflammatory cytokines assay. Twenty-three inflammatory cytokines in serum samples from M. mulatta and M. fascicularis were quantitated and dynamically analyzed at the indicated time points. We found that eight cytokines (G-CSF, IL-1A, IL-8, IL-15, IL-18, MCP-1, MIP-1B, sCD40-L), among 23 cytokines assayed, were detected in most of animals. Especially, expression of sCD40-Lwas beyond the upper limitation of detection in most of tested samples (data not shown). IL-10 was only induced in monkeys of HHH-11 and SXH-6 on 4 dpi. In addition, IL-1A, IL-8, IL-15 and MCP-1 were strikingly induced in HHH-11 and SXH-6 and peaked on 2 or 4 dpi. Monkey HHH3 produced a peak of IL-15, IL-18 and in order to further investigate histopathogical responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we necropsied 8 animals on 4 dpi (HHH-13), 7 dpi (HHH-14), 12 dpi (HHH-8), 13 dpi (SXH-1, RH-2, RH-5), 15 dpi (HHH-3 and HHH-12). Severe gross lesions were observed on lung, heart and stomach of M. mulatta and M. fascicularis, but not C. jacchus. The main gross lesions involved massive pulmonary punctate haemorrhage, swollen Hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, pericardial effusion, and swollen Mesenteric lymph nodes (Figure 5A). Histopathological analysis showed that thickening of the pulmonary septum and infiltration of inflammatory cells, diffuse hemorrhage and necrosis in M. mulatta. Exudate, a small number of lymphocytes and neutrophils were found in some blood vessels of M. mulatta liver, and some hepatocytes were swollen, with multiple vacuole like cells (mild) steatosis. The structure of spleen was clear, the number of germinal centers increased significantly, and capillary hemorrhage occurred in paracortical area. The number of germinal centers of mesenteric lymph nodes significantly increased. The space of renal vesicle space was widened and some glomeruli were atrophied. In M. fascicularis, histopathological changes in the respiratory system were similar to those examined in M. mulatta. Hyperplasia of mesenteric lymph nodes was observed in M. fascicularis. Mild infiltration of local inflammatory cells was also examined in the kidney of infected M. fascicularis. C. jacchus showed slight infiltration of inflammatory cells into the broken pulmonary septum with some necrotic cells. The hepatocytes were swollen. Light hemorrhage was observed in spleen, the germinal center of which is in actively proliferative condition (Figure 5B). Furthermore, ultrastructural examination under transmission electronic microscope was conducted on 70-80nm ultrathin sections.

In order to confirm results of chest radiographs, we played a very important match game and found that in some cases, gross lesions on lungs observed after necropsy strikingly matched abnormal spots of chest radiographs collected right before necropsy.Laboratory routine assays include BCT, BCA, biochemistry indexes, flow cytometric analysis, results of which could be used to evaluate patients' health and immune status. More than 50% COVID-19 patients have lymphopenia and/or esoinopenia, indicating their immunity may be affected by viralinfection 3,18,25 . High levels of D-dimer, CRP, procalcitonin and ALT are assayed in severe patients, which suggests abnormal functions of liver and blood coagulation 26-28 . By flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood from M. mulatta and M. fascicularis in the present study, we showed the changes and trends of T cells, B cells and monocytes after viral infection (Figure 4B), indicating that host immune responses were induced by SARS-CoV-2 viral genomic RNA is the most important evidence for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dynamic analysis of virus shedding will be beneficial for treatment and control of COVID-19. Comparative studies of large amount of clinical samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients demonstrate that 93% bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were viral RNA positive, followed by sputum (72%), nasal swabs (63%), feces (29%) andblood/serum (1%)30 . In samples from upper respiratory track, nasal swabs had higher levels of viral RNA than those in throat swabs30 . SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasal swabs was detectable at the onset of disease, and peaked on day 2 post onset of disease. After that, it began to decline slowly, and usually last for about 2 weeks 31 . In the present study, dynamics of virus shedding in the NHP was similar to that reported in COVID-19 patients, although some minor disparities existed due to differences between disease onset in patients and viral inoculation time in animals. On day 2 post viral inoculation, there was an unusual peak of viral genome RNA in nasal swabs (Figure 3A). We speculated that this may be the left-over of viral nucleic acid from viral inoculation, but not from replicating viruses since it sharply declined on 4 dpi.The real peak of detectable RNA from replicating viruses should be from 6 dpi to 8 dpi in nasal swabs from infected animals. In addition, detectable viral RNA in anal swabs and expression of ACE2 in digestive tract of patients with covid-19 suggest that fecal-oral routine has a great potential risk in the transmission of SARS-CoV-232 . In this study, we noticed that high level of virus shedding via feces lasted for a long time in 4 monkeys of animal model (Figure 3A). Viral load in various tissues, as an indicator of tropism, correlates with viral pathogenesis. Lung is widely considered to be the target organ for SARS-Cov-2 replication since plenty of viruses are detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from COVID-19 patients30 . At the earlier stage of our animal models, we could detect SARS-CoV-2 viral genomic RNA in lung and the other respiratory tissues (Figure 3C). However, SARS-CoV-2 RNA became",

So far, most of the clinical reports on the pathological changes of covid-19 come from the aged patients with comorbidities, focusing on lungs. Typical histopathology of pneumonia is observed in COVID-19 patients in additional to mild inflammation in liver and heart 34 . After SARS-CoV-2 infection, M. mulatta and M. fascicularis, but not C. jacchus, showed severe histopathological changes in lung as pneumonia, and inflammation in liver and heart.In conclusion, the NHP model in this study simulates several important aspects of COVID-19. Using this model, we should further explore pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in order to answer some critical remaining questions in clinics, such as the refractory patients, cytokine storm, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and so on.
