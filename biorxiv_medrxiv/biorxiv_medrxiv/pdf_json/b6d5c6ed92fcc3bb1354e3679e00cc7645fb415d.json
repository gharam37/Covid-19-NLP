            "text": "Acute lung inflammation has severe morbidity, as seen in COVID-19 patients. Lung inflammation is accompanied or led by massive accumulation of neutrophils in pulmonary capillaries (\"margination\"). We sought to identify nanostructural properties that predispose nanoparticles to accumulate in pulmonary marginated neutrophils, and therefore to target severely inflamed lungs. We designed a library of nanoparticles and conducted an in vivo screen of biodistributions in naive mice and mice treated with lipopolysaccharides. We found that supramolecular organization of protein in nanoparticles predicts uptake in inflamed lungs. Specifically, nanoparticles with agglutinated protein (NAPs) efficiently home to pulmonary neutrophils, while protein nanoparticles with symmetric structure (e.g. viral capsids) are ignored by pulmonary neutrophils. We validated this finding by engineering protein-conjugated liposomes that recapitulate NAP targeting to neutrophils in inflamed lungs. We show that NAPs can diagnose acute lung injury in SPECT imaging and that NAP-like liposomes can mitigate neutrophil extravasation and pulmonary edema arising in lung inflammation. Finally, we demonstrate that ischemic ex vivo human lungs selectively take up NAPs, illustrating translational potential. This work demonstrates that structure-dependent interactions with neutrophils can dramatically alter the biodistribution of nanoparticles, and NAPs have significant potential in detecting and treating respiratory conditions arising from injury or infections.",

Severe ARDS is the cause of death in most COVID-19 mortality and was a major cause of death in the 1918 influenza epidemic, but ARDS is common even outside of epidemics, affecting ~200,000 American patients per year with a ~35-50% mortality rate. 1-6 ARDS is caused not just by viral infections, but also by sepsis, pneumonia (viral and bacterial), aspiration, and trauma. 3, 4 Largely because ARDS patients have poor tolerance of drug side effects, no pharmacological strategy has succeeded as an ARDS treatment. 5, [7] [8] [9] Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop drug delivery strategies that specifically target inflamed alveoli in ARDS and minimize systemic side effects.",

            "text": "Neutrophils are \"first responder\" cells in acute inflammation, rapidly adhering and activating in large numbers in inflamed vessels and forming populations of \"marginated\" neutrophils along the vascular lumen. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Neutrophils can be activated by a variety of initiating factors, including pathogen-and damage-associated molecular patterns such as bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). 17, 18 After acute inflammatory insults, neutrophils marginate in most organs, but by far most avidly in the lung capillaries. 6, 14, 15, 19, 20 Neutrophils are therefore key cell types in most forms of ARDS. In ARDS, marginated neutrophils can secrete tissue-damaging substances (proteases, reactive oxygen species) and extravasate into the alveoli, leading to disruption of the endothelial barrier and accumulation of neutrophils and edematous fluid in the air space of the lungs ( Figure 1A ). 6, 15, 16, [19] [20] [21] Targeted nanoparticle delivery to marginated neutrophils could provide an ARDS treatment with minimal side effects, but specific delivery to marginated neutrophils remains an open challenge. Antibodies against markers such as Ly6G have achieved targeting to neutrophils in mice, but also deplete populations of circulating neutrophils. [22] [23] [24] [25] Additionally, while Ly6G readily marks neutrophils in mice, there is no analogous specific and ubiquitous marker on human neutrophils. 22 Therefore, antibody targeting strategies have not been widely adopted for targeted drug delivery to these cells. 24 As another route to neutrophil targeting, two previous studies noted that activated neutrophils take up denatured and agglutinated bovine albumin, concluding that denatured protein was critical in neutrophil-particle interactions. 26, 27 Nanoparticle structural properties such as shape, size, and deformability can define unique targeting behaviors. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] Here, we screened a diverse panel of nanoparticles to determine the nanostructural properties that predict uptake in pulmonary marginated neutrophils during acute inflammation. As a high-throughput animal model for ARDS, we administered LPS to mice, causing a massive increase in pulmonary marginated neutrophils. We show that two initial leads in our screen, lysozyme-dextran nanogels (LDNGs) and crosslinked albumin nanoparticles (ANPs), selectively home to marginated neutrophils in inflamed lungs, but not na\u00efve lungs. In our subsequent screen of over 20 diverse nanoparticles, we find that 13 protein nanoparticles, all defined by agglutination of protein in amorphous nanostructures (nanoparticles with agglutinated proteins, NAPs), but not by denatured protein, have specificity for LPS-inflamed lungs. In contrast to NAPs, we demonstrate that three symmetric protein nanostructures (viruses/nanocages) have biodistributions unaffected by LPS injury. We show that polystyrene nanoparticles and five liposome formulations do not accumulate in injured lungs, indicating that nanostructures that are not based on protein are not intrinsically drawn to marginated neutrophils in acute inflammation. We then engineered liposomes (the most clinically relevant nanoparticle drug carriers) as NAPs, through conjugation to protein modified with hydrophobic cyclooctynes, encouraging protein agglutination on the liposome surface by hydrophobic interactions. We thus show that supramolecular organization of proteins, rather than chemical composition, best predicts uptake in marginated neutrophils in acutely inflamed lungs.",

Accumulation of anti-Ly6G antibody in the lungs was dramatically affected by IV LPS, with 20.81% of injected antibody adhering in LPS-injured lungs, compared to 2.82% of injected antibody in na\u00efve control lungs ( Figure 1B) .

To identify intravascular populations of leukocytes, mice received IV fluorescent CD45 antibody five minutes prior to sacrifice. Single cell suspensions prepared from IV CD45-stained lungs were then stained with anti-Ly6G antibody to identify neutrophils.

Comparison of Ly6G stain to IV CD45 stain indicated that the majority of neutrophils were intravascular, in both na\u00efve and LPSinjured mice. In na\u00efve mice, 85.3% of neutrophils were intravascular and in LPS-injured mice, 96.2% of neutrophils were intravascular ( Figure 1D , right panel). The presence of large populations of intravascular neutrophils following inflammatory injury is consistent with previously published observations. 6, 10, 14, 18, 33 Histological analysis confirmed results obtained with flow cytometry and radiolabeled anti-Ly6G biodistributions. Staining of lung sections indicated increased concentration of neutrophils in the lungs following IV LPS injury ( Figure 1E , left panels). Co-registration of neutrophil staining with tissue autofluorescence (indicating tissue architecture) broadly supported the finding that pulmonary neutrophils reside in the vasculature ( Figure 1E , right panels).",

Identical CD spectra were recorded for LDNGs vs. lysozyme and for albumin NPs vs. human albumin. Deconvolution of the CD spectra via neural network algorithm trained against a library of CD spectra for known structures verified that secondary structure composition of lysozyme and albumin was unchanged by incorporation of the proteins in the NPs. 40 Free protein and protein NPs were also probed with 8-anilino-1naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANSA), previously established as a tool for determining the extent to which hydrophobic domains are exposed on proteins. 41 Consistent with known structures of the two proteins, ANSA staining indicated few available hydrophobic domains on lysozyme and substantial hydrophobic exposure on albumin (Supplementary Figure 7C -D, blue curves). LDNGs had increased hydrophobic accessibility vs. native lysozyme whereas albumin NPs had reduced hydrophobic accessibility compared with native albumin. Therefore, our data indicate that lysozyme and albumin are not denatured in LDNGs and albumin NPs, but the NPs composed of the two proteins present a balance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces differing from the native proteins.",

As examples of different types of protein NPs, variants of LDNGs (representing NPs based on hydrophobic interactions between proteins), crosslinked protein NPs, and NPs based on electrostatic interactions between proteins were traced in na\u00efve control and IV-LPS-injured mice. As examples of NPs based on site-specific protein interactions (rather than site-indiscriminate interactions leading to crosslinking, gelation, or chargebased protein NPs), we also traced viruses and ferritin nanocages in na\u00efve and LPStreated mice.

[53] [54] [55] [56] It is conceivable that neutrophils more effectively recognize less patterned and more variable protein arrangements that may better parallel the wide variety of structures presented by the staggering diversity of microbes against which neutrophils defend. 20, 35 To support our conclusions regarding supramolecular organization and neutrophil tropism, we re-engineered liposomes, particles with no intrinsic neutrophil tropism, to behave like NAPs. Protein arrangement on the surface of DBCO-IgG liposomes was predicted to recapitulate protein agglutination seen in NAPs based on hydrophobic interactions. Introduction of DBCO to IgG entails conjugation of a highly hydrophobic moiety 57 to hydrophilic residues on the IgG. Replacing DBCO with the less hydrophobic modifying group used in SATA-maleimide conjugation 58 abrogates the inflammation specificity observed with DBCO-IgG liposomes. Likewise, titrating down the amount of DBCO on the IgG, thus limiting the hydrophobic groups on the protein, also ratchets down the targeting behavior of the DBCO-IgG liposomes. Our data therefore points towards hydrophobic interactions between proteins on the liposome surface being a determinant in liposome uptake in neutrophils in the inflamed lungs. Essentially, the DBCO-IgG liposomes may reproduce the hydrophobic interaction structural motif seen in NAPs produced by protein gelation (i.e. LDNGs).",

            "text": "NAP-liposomes may be particularly attractive for future clinical translatability. Liposomes are prominent among FDA-approved nanoparticle drug carriers. 59 Further, even without cargo drugs, NAP-liposomes conferred significant therapeutic effects in a mouse model of severe ARDS. LDNGs, despite high levels of uptake in inflamed lungs, did not have the same therapeutic effect as the NAP-liposomes. This result suggests that the composition of the liposomes may be important for their therapeutic effect. Among possible mechanisms for the therapeutic effect, we note that lipid rafts are major signaling hubs in neutrophils. 60, 61 The lipid content of the NAP-liposomes (particularly the cholesterol content) may modulate neutrophil lipid rafts dependent on cholesterol. We have also observed that neutrophil content in the inflamed alveoli is markedly reduced by NAP-liposomes. In this context, we note published work demonstrating that certain nanoparticles, in a still undetermined manner dependent on particle composition, can drive redistribution of neutrophils from the lungs to the liver. 52 As a major corollary, our findings indicate many protein-based or proteinincorporating nanoparticles developed for therapeutic applications may accumulate in inflamed lungs, even when those nanoparticles were designed to accumulate elsewhere. The variety of protein nanostructures accumulating in inflamed lungs in our data includes particles that have been investigated as targeted drug delivery vehicles where marginated neutrophils are not the intended site of accumulation. 36, 38, 47, 48, 62 The patterns in our data indicate that future studies may reveal additional nanoparticles that accumulate in the lungs following inflammatory insult. This study therefore serves as evidence that inflammatory challenges may prompt profound off-target changes in the biodistributions of nanomaterials, including dramatic shunting of nanoparticles and any associated drug payload to the lungs. The nanoparticle targeting profiles documented in na\u00efve or, for instance, tumor model studies may be overturned by, for instance, bacterial infection in a patient receiving the nanoparticle.

Specifically, nanoparticles with agglutinated protein (NAPs) accumulate in marginated neutrophils, while nanoparticles with more symmetric protein organization do not. NAP tropism for neutrophils allowed us to develop NAPs as diagnostics and therapeutics for ARDS, and even to demonstrate NAP uptake in inflamed human lungs. Future work may more deeply explore therapeutic effects of NAPs in ARDS and other diseases in which neutrophils play key roles. This study also obviates future testing of supramolecular organization as a variable in in vivo behavior of nanoparticles, including screens of tropism for other pathologies and cell types. These studies could in turn guide engineering of new particles with intrinsic cell tropisms, as with our engineering of NAP-liposomes with neutrophil tropism. These \"targeting\" behaviors, requiring no affinity moieties, may apply to a wide variety of nanomaterials. But our current findings with neutrophil-tropic NAPs indicate that many protein-based and protein-coated nanoparticles could be untapped resources for treatment and diagnosis of devastating inflammatory disorders like ARDS.",
