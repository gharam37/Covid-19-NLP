The entry of the virus into cells is mediated by the binding of the viral Spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), followed by its priming by the TMPRSS2 serine protease, both present on the cellular membrane of the target cells. In the respiratory tract, these targets are ciliated cells. Interestingly, various reports indicate an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and anosmia, suggesting an alteration not restricted to the respiratory tissue, but that might also include the olfactory sensory epithelium. We explored this possibility by generating RNA-seq libraries from human neuroepithelium, in which we found significant expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. To determine whether specific cell types of this chemosensory tissue may coexpress both of the virus entry genes, we analyzed a scRNA-seq dataset. We determined that sustentacular cells, which are in direct contact with the external world and maintain the integrity of olfactory sensory neurons, represents a prime candidate for SARS-CoV-2 infection via the nose, and possibly for SARS-CoV-2-induced anosmia.",

The mammalian nasal cavity can be divided into two areas, the respiratory and the olfactory areas, that are anatomically, cellularly, and functionally different 11 . In humans, the respiratory part covers the major part of the nasal cavity. It includes the turbinates and is lined with a ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium. Its function is to humidify, cool or warm the incoming air, and to trap small particles before they get into the lungs. The second nasal area corresponds to the olfactory neuroepithelium. In our species, it is located in the very dorsal part of the cavity. There, it contacts chemicals entering the nose, an interaction which represents the first step in the process that leads to the identification of a given smell. This epithelium is pseudostratified, and includes Bowman's glands, olfactory sensory neurons, sustentacular cells, microvillar cells, globose and horizontal basal cells (cells that keep dividing during adult life and replenish the pool of sensory neurons) 12 . Each sensory neuron extends a dendrite that ends in multiple and long specialized ciliae, which are covered with odorant receptors and bath in the mucus that lines the nasal cavity. Olfactory sensory neuron dendrites are enwrapped inside specialized cells, the sustentacular cells 13 , whose nuclei and cell bodies line the external layer of the thick neuroepithelium (although they remain attached to the basal lamina). The role played by the latter in maintaining the integrity and function of the neuroepithelium is critical, in a very similar way that Sertoli cells support germ cell development and survival. Indeed, the presence of various drugs (such as 3-methylindole 14 , the anti-thyroid drug methimazole 15 , or nickel sulfate 16 ) to which sustentacular cells are quickly and very sensitive, leads to transient anosmia.",

To explore this question, we first collected and analyzed the transcriptome of human olfactory biopsies from sensory olfactory tissue and from nasal respiratory epithelia. We found expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in nasal respiratory tissue, as expected, but also in olfactory neuroepithelia. We then used a publicly available human scRNA-seq dataset to precisely identify the cell types expressing these two genes. We found coexpression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in olfactory horizontal basal cells, microvillar cells, Bowman's glands, but more importantly -because they are numerous and in direct contact with the outside world -in olfactory sustentacular cells. Finally, we investigated by using publicly available mouse and human brain scRNA-seq data, the presence of cells in the central nervous system; we found no cell type expressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, or their orthologs, in the brain.",

As expected, olfactory epithelium markers displayed a significant difference in transcript amounts between both tissues ( Figure 1A -G, T test on pooled scaled mean expression: p-value=5e-15). The presence of potential ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcripts was then evaluated. We observed a mean of 0.8 and 63.7 TPMs in the respiratory epithelium samples for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 respectively (Figure 1 G,H), reflecting the presence of ciliated cells which represent targets of SARS-CoV-2. We found a mean of 0.6 and 76.1 TPMs in the sensory neuroepithelium samples for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 respectively ( Figure  1H ,I), indicating the presence in this tissue of cells that may either express both genes, or of a mix of cells that express either TMPRSS2 or ACE2.

This dataset contains the transcriptome of 28'726 single cells, collected during nasal endoscopic surgery of 4 adult patients. Prior to any cell type analysis, we monitored the existence of cells that would transcribe both TMPRSS2 and ACE2 (Figure 2A) . We then performed an aggregate analysis of the 28'726 single cells, and generated a UMAP dimensionality reduction plot, which allowed to display the clustering of the 26 different cell types reported in the original publication 17 , including olfactory, respiratory and immune cells ( Figure 2B ). We then identified all cells expressing ACE2, TMPRSS2, ERMN (an olfactory sustentacular cell marker) and GSTA2 (a marker of respiratory ciliated and epithelial cells) ( Figure 2C ), or those coexpressing both TMPRSS2 and ACE2 ( Figure 2D ). Olfactory sensory neurons showed little or no expression of either TMPRSS2 or ACE2 ( Figure 2C ). In contrast, and expectedly, a clear cluster of cells corresponding to respiratory ciliated cells ( Figure 2C ,D), expressed both TMPRSS2 and ACE2. More interestingly, individual cells pertaining to the olfactory neuroepithelium, including sustentacular cells ( Figure  2C ), did also express both TMPRSS2 and ACE2. To better evaluate the coexpression levels of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in the different cellular populations, we plotted the mean expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 corresponding to each of these subpopulations ( Respiratory cells are thus not the only ones in contact with the outside world that exhibit the molecular keys involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry in the nose. Sustentacular cells, which are localized at a porous boundary between the central nervous system and the olfactory cavity, share the same characteristics.",

These cells are related to pericytes and coexpress the mural cell marker Rgs5. They express relatively low levels of Ace2 transcripts, with a maximum of 0.28 normalized UMI counts in the pericytes cluster PER3, compared to 7.39 for Rgs5, a pericyte marker (Figure 3 B) . Tmprss2, whose transcripts were barely detected, is expressed by even less cell types, with a maximum of 0.04 normalized UMI counts in Purkinje cells (not shown in the figure) . These observations were confirmed by the second mouse dataset 22 , in which mural cells were the main cell type that expressed Ace2 (Figure 3 C) . None of these cell populations coexpressed Tmprss2.

And why are horizontal basal cells that also coexpress TMPRSS2 and ACE2 not prime candidates? First, given the slow rate of neuronal renewal in the main olfactory epithelium and the apparent rapid development of SARS-CoV-2-triggered anosmia, a perturbation of the stem cell pool constituted by the horizontal basal cells appears unlikely to represent an immediate disturbance to the system. Second, the significant amounts of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 transcripts we observed in sustentacular cells are in the same range as the one observed in respiratory ciliated cells, suggesting at least that sustentacular cells play in the same league in terms of SARS-CoV-2 receptors. Third, sustentacular cells are in direct contact with the olfactory cavity, and thus with anything that enters the nose. Finally, a known and critical role is played by sustentacular cells in the maintenance of the olfactory neuroepithelium integrity: if they die, the whole neuroepithelium disaggregates, leading to anosmia. Taken together, and despite the fact that one cannot exclude inflammation and the infection of other non-neuronal cell types in the olfactory neuroepithelium as an origin of the SARS-CoV-2-induced anosmia, the link between the viral molecular entry tools expressed by olfactory sustentacular cells and the chemosensory alteration appears quite credible. Naturally, a next step would be the study of the olfactory epithelium of a mouse model expressing the human ACE2/TMPRSS2 in sustentacular cells, and nasal biopsies of human olfactory neuroepithelia just after SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Indeed, in addition to anosmia, ageusia -that is loss of tastehas been reported 8 . Whether these reports truly reflect taste anomalies, or rather olfactory perturbations that may drastically affect the flavor of food, is unclear. However, this potential double effect on two chemosensory systems that share nothing at the periphery may suggest a more central alteration, involving for example a direct infection of the brain by SARS-CoV-2. Again, such viral migration to the central nervous system, and in particular from the olfactory neuroepithelium, would not be a first. SARS-CoV particles (that is the virus responsible for the previous SARS epidemic in 2002) have in fact been found in the human brain 18-20 . Adding to this idea is the observation that in a transgenic mouse model expressing the human ACE2 and infected with SARS-CoV, brain lesions were observed. Moreover, a retrospective case study on 214 COVID-19 patients reported neurological manifestations possibly correlated with the severity of the disease (with the confounding factor that old people are more likely to be very sick) 28 . However, in the present work we did not identify neuronal or non-neuronal cell types in the mouse or human brain that coexpressed the orthologs of the human ACE2 and TMPRSS2. This lack of coexpression is also true for human olfactory sensory neurons, as shown in this work. Moreover, significant brain damage in humans seems quite unlikely or at least rare, since no specific cognitive or other brain-related deficits resulting directly from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the central nervous system were reported. author/funder.

Briefly, the 10X files were loaded into R using the Read10X function of Seurat. A single Seurat object for all four patients was created using the CreateSeuratObject function of Seurat. At this step, genes not expressed in at least 3 cells at a threshold of a minimum of 1 UMI count were excluded from the analysis. The percentage of mitochondrial counts was then calculated for each cell using the PercentageFeatureSet function of Seurat. Cells author/funder. All rights reserved.
