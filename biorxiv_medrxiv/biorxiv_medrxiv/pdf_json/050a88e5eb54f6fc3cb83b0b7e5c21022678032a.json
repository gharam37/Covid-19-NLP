We initially employ a purely statistical approach to predicting prevalence of COVID19 if RSC were upheld after April 20. We employ these \u2026ndings and feed them into our theoretical model. We \u2026nd that the peak of the number of sick individuals would be reached already mid April. The number of sick individuals would fall below 1,000 at the beginning of July. When restrictions are lifted completely on April 20, the number of sick should rise quickly again from around April 27. A balance between economic and individual costs of RSC and public health objectives consists in lifting RSC for activities that have high economic bene\u2026ts but low health costs. In the absence of large-scale representative testing of CoV-2 infections, these activities can most easily be identi\u2026ed if federal states of Germany adopted exit strategies that di\u00a4er across states. .

A permanent RSC would yield an epidemic in Germany that would lead to around 184,000 sick individuals only. The epidemic would not be over, however, as most individuals would still likely be susceptible to an infection. A permanent RSC would also not be economically sustainable. A complete lift is likely to yield a fast increase of the number of sick that would overstrain the public health system. This points towards the need to think about exit options which promise to keep infection rates stable. Exit strategies should be reversible and tested for, say, 4 weeks and di\u00a4er across regions. This would allow authorities to understand their health and economic e\u00a4ects. Learning about policy measures appears essential in this global pandemic.",

We build our analysis on the model and projection presented in Donsimoni et al. (2020a) . 2 In contrast to this paper, we (i) provide a more precise calibration of the e\u00a4ect of no public health measures. The precision results from the availability of more observations. This is essential for quantifying the e\u00a4ects of lifting RSC. We (ii) can also quantify the e\u00a4ects of RSC in the present paper as su\u00a2 cient data has become available since our earlier work. Our most recent observation now is from 7 April. Most importantly, due to the availability of enough observations, we can (iii) employ purely statistical methods to make a forecast for the current RSC. This allows us to work without assumptions about long-run infection and sickness rates. For judging the e\u00a4ect of a lift of RSC, we do need to return to long-run assumptions, however, as we need to work with the theoretical model developed in Donsimoni et al. (2020a) again. Adamik et al. (2020) also quantitatively analyse the situation in Germany. They employ a microsimulation model which allows to better understand the e\u00a4ect of heterogeneity across households. They argue that reaching herd immunity without violating the capacity limit of the health care system is likely to fail. They do not explicitly analyse the e\u00a4ects of RSC and do not discuss the \u2026t of their model to observed data. Dehning et al. (2020) estimate parameters of their model in a statistically very convincing way. They focus on constant transition rates for di\u00a4erent RSC-regimes (but do allow for time-dependency to smooth between regimes). They make forecasts for a period of two to three weeks and use data up to 31 March. 3 The analysis by Gros et al. (2020) also takes the economic costs of RSC into account. They do not provide forecasts. Promising future work could combine their economic cost approach with forecasts.",

The long-run number of individuals that, once the epidemic is over, were ever reported to be sick is the probability to get sick after an infection, r = 10%; times the long-run share of infected individuals, = 60%; times population size, N = 83:1 million, i.e. the long-run number of sick individuals equals 4:99 5 million. This is the number of sick individuals in the \"normal\"scenario of Donsimoni et al. (2020a,b) . In their \"optimistic Hubei scenario\", they assume that the population share of ever infected individuals once the epidemic is over amounts to = 6% only. In this scenario, the long-run number of sick individuals is 10% 6% 83:1 million =498:6 thousand individuals, i.e. roughly 0.5 million individuals. Once this quantity is \u2026xed, any public health measure in our model only shifts the number of sick individuals over the duration of the epidemic. RSC reduces the sickness rate 12 from (2) in the short-run but only delays the infection of the rest of N ever 2 (end) from (4). We admit that this is a strong implication of our model but we only \"translate\" assumptions made in more general not model-based discussions. 9 Given that this is a strong assumption and given our Gompertz curve estimation of the current situation in Germany illustrated in \u2026gure 3, we are now in the lucky situation that we can do without a strong assumption for N ever 2 (end) for the current RSC. For the current regime (but not for the end of the entire COVID19 epidemic), \u2026gure 3 tells us that we are converging in May or June to a value of roughly 184; 000 sick individuals. To make clear that this value is 8 As discussed below, we assume that a lift on 20 April would imply observable e\u00a4ects only around one week later. 9 In ongoing work we study the historical evidence about r from other epidemics and pandemics. No systematic evidence seems to be available at this point. We are grateful to dozens of epidemiologists, virologists, economists and decision-makers for discussions of this point.",

We therefore assume a lower value for the long-run infection rate of = 0:04: 12 As is clear from this discussion, a complete lifting of current social distancing rules should lead to an increase in the number of sick individuals again.

If di\u00a4erent regions (or even smaller communities) run di\u00a4erent policies and data is well-recorded for smaller areas as well, decision makers could quickly learn about which measures are most e\u00a4ective in terms of reducing infection rates as well as reducing economic and social costs. As an example, some regions could allow for schools to open again as of grade 9, others only as of grade 5. Other regions could allow restaurants (preserving a distance of 2 meters between tables) to open, while others do not. A trial period of four weeks with partially relaxed rules in some parts of Germany should be enough to identify the e\u00a4ects. One should then be prepared to adjust the measures (both upwards or downwards depending on the outcomes) in around four weeks after relaxing the measures.",
