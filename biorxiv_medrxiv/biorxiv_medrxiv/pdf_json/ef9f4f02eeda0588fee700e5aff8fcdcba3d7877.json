            "text": "Detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections to date has relied on RT-PCR testing. However, a failure to identify early cases imported to a country, bottlenecks in RT-PCR testing, and the existence of infections which are asymptomatic, sub-clinical, or with an alternative presenta-15 tion than the standard cough and fever have resulted in an under-counting of the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show how publicly available CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatient surveillance data can be repurposed to estimate the detection rate of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. We find a surge of non-influenza ILI above the seasonal average and show that this surge is correlated with COVID case counts across states. By quantifying the 20 number of excess ILI patients in March relative to previous years and comparing excess ILI to confirmed COVID case counts, we estimate the syndromic case detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the US to be approximately 1 our of 100. This corresponds to at least 28 million presumed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients across the US during the three week period from March 8 to March 28. Combining excess ILI counts with the date of onset of community transmission in 25 the US, we also show that the early epidemic in the US was unlikely to be doubling slower than every 3.5 days. Together these results suggest a conceptual model for the COVID epidemic in the US in which rapid spread across the US are combined with a large population of infected patients with presumably mild-to-moderate clinical symptoms. We emphasize the importance of testing these findings with seroprevalence data, and discuss the broader potential to use 30 syndromic time series for early detection and understanding of emerging infectious diseases.",

This surge of excess ILI correlates with known patterns of SARS-CoV-2 spread across states within the US, suggesting the surge is unlikely to be due to other endemic respiratory pathogens, yet is orders of magnitude larger than the number of confirmed COVID cases reported. Together this suggests that the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 within the US is much larger than currently appreciated and that the syndromic case detection rate is approximately 1%, corresponding to at least 28 million new ILI cases due to SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis provides empirical corroboration of previous hypotheses 55 of substantial undocumented cases yet places the estimated undocumented case rate an order of magnitude higher than prior reports [6] . The SARS-CoV-2 prevalence estimates obtained from the ILI surge are consistent an epidemic doubling time of less than 3.5 days. A 3.5 day doubling time is substantially faster than many prior reports [7, 8] yet is consistent with the 3-day doubling time of observed deaths due to COVID within the US. Our findings support a conceptual model 60 for COVID spread in the US in which more rapid spread than previously reported is coupled with a larger undiagnosed population to give rise to currently observed trends. Finally, we find that the ILI surge peaks the week starting March 15, and we discuss the potential explanations for this phenomenon.",

For example, in the second week 70 of March, 2020, Oregon saw 50% higher non-influenza ILI than it had ever seen since the inception of the ILINet surveillance system within the US. We find that with 95% probability approximately 4% of all outpatient visits in Oregon during this time were for ILI that could not be explained by either influenza or the normal seasonal variation of respiratory pathogens. We find that as the seasonal surge of endemic non-influenza respiratory pathogens declines, this excess ILI correlates 75 more strongly with state-level patterns of newly confirmed COVID cases suggesting that this surge is a reflection of ILI due to SARS-CoV-2 (Pearson \u03c1 > 0.35 and p < 0.01 for the last three weeks; Figure S1A ).",

Adjusting the ILI surge to account for decreased care-seeking does not produce congruence between the epidemic curve and the ILI surge, suggesting additional factors can be affecting the ILI surge, such as successful interventions, even faster decreases in care-seeking than observed in New York, or epidemic growth rates faster than 3 days.",

For a four-day lag between the onset of infectiousness and presentation with ILI, the doubling time of US deaths produces, on average, too few COVID cases to explain the excess ILI 130 on March 14. However, 29.8% of the stochastic simulations with a growth rate similar to that of US deaths produced enough COVID cases to explain the ILI surge and thus suggest either secondary introductions, super-spreading, or rapid transmission events in early transmission chains to exceed the ILI surge [11] . On the other hand, the doubling time of deaths in Italy could capture the US excess ILI with a 38.8% clinical rate. If researchers produce estimates of growth rates for the 135 US epidemic, the ILI surge can be used to estimate bounds and ranges of possible clinical rates ( Figure 3C ).

However, the changing ratio between the ILI surge and the epidemic curves parameterized by the growth rate of US deaths suggests additional mechanisms may be behind the ILI slowdown. First, a slowdown in ILI outpatient arrivals could be due to decrease in care-seeking where patients with mild ILI are less likely to present to the hospital as evident in emergency departments across New York City. Adjusting our ILI prevalence 160 estimates based on the effect observed in New York City aligns ILI estimates more closely with predicted dynamics, yet the discrepancy remains.

A second epidemic of a non-seasonal pathogen that presents with ILI could confound our estimates of ILI due to SARS-CoV-2. Alternatively, it is also possible that our use of ILI data has underestimated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 within the US. While early clinical reports focused on cough and fever as the dominant features of COVID [5] , other reports have documented digestive symptoms as the complaint affecting up to half of patients 170 with laboratory-confirmed COVID [12] , and alternative presentations, including asymptomatic or unnoticeable infections, could result in ILI surges underestimating SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. Additionally, our models have several limitations. First we assume that ILI prevalence within states can be scaled to case counts at the state level. This is based on the assumption that the average number of cases seen by sentinel providers in a given week is representative of the 175 average number of patients seen by all providers within that state in a given week. Errors in this assumptions would cause proportional errors in our estimated case counts and syndromic case detection rate. Second, our epidemic models are crude, US-wide SEIR models varying by growth rate alone and as such do not capture regional variation or intervention-induced changes in transmission. Our models were used to estimate growth rates from ILI for testing with COVID 180 data and to estimate the mutual dependency of growth rate, the lag between the onset of infection and presentation to a doctor, and clinical rates; these models were not intended to be fine-grained forecasts for municipality hospital burden and other common goals for COVID models. Finer models with regional demographic, and case-severity compartments are needed to translate our range of estimated prevalence, growth rate, and clinical rates into actionable models for public 185 health managers.",

Since not all novel pandemic diseases are expected to present with influenza-like symptoms, surveillance of other common presenting illnesses in the outpatient setting could provide a vital tool for rapidly understanding and responding to novel infectious diseases. 200 ",

Figure 3 : (a) The excess ILI estimated falls within the range of what one could expect from a US epidemic growing at the exponential growth rate defined by the growth of new deaths. Adjusting the ILI surge based on decreased care seeking in New York does not reconcile the difference bewteen the ILI surge and the epidemic curve from US growth rates, suggesting additional forces are at play. The cause of the apparent deceleration in the ILI surge is hypothesized to be due to some combination of successful interventions, faster decreases in care-seeking behavior changing than measured in New York, and/or other possibilities including faster growth and higher subclinical rates. (b) If the growth rate in the US is faster than US deaths suggest, such as a growth rate observed in Italy prior to the Italian lockdown (2.645 day doubling time), it could provide alternative explanations of the curvature of the excess ILI through a larger subclinical rate and epidemic curves near their peak at the time of the peak of the ILI surge. Serology or other measures of prevalence are needed to reconcile these alternative hypotheses. (c) More generally, the ILI surge forces a dependence between growth rate (doubling time), the clinical rate, and the lag between the onset of infectiousness and presentation to the doctor with ILI, where faster growth implies a slower clinical rate.",
