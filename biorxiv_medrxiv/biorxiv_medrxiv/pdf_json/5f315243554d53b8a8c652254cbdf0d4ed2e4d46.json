A deviation from exponential growth to Sigmoid function is analyzed in the data profile of China and South Korea. Projecting that pattern to time dependent data of total number and new cases in India, we have drawn three possible Sigmoid functions, which saturate to cases 10 4 , 10 5 , 10 6 . Ongoing data has doubtful signal of those possibilities and future hope is probably in extension of lock-down and additional imposition of interventions.",

Within a three months time period, the spreading from China to entire world become so violent that WHO declared it as a pandemic disease on 11th March, 2020 [1] . In present draft, we are just going to describe the existing n-cov data of India with respect to other countries where we have zoomed in the exponential growth and its corresponding time axis zone. Then, its deviation from exponential growth is discussed and we have sketched different possible deviated curves, which may be or may not be expected from present lock-down schenario of our country (India). Here we have attempted to analyze the raw data of India with comparison to other countries and tried to understand the growth pattern. Taking the data of ncov positive cases for India, Italy, USA, South Korea (SK), China from the wikipedia links [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] , we have plotted in the left panel of Fig. (1) , where x axis is denoting as days and y axis is denoting the number of cases. The day, from when first cases is detected, is considered as day one. The first case detected in India, Italy, USA, SK, are 30th January, 31st January, 20th January, 20th January in 2020 respectively and for China date of first detection is not very clear but wuhan CDC admitted about a cluster of cases on 31st December, 2019. Though detection dates of first case is different for different countries but they are considered as same initial point in the graph. The y axis is taken in logarithm scale to cover rapidly growing numbers of +ve cases with days. If we assume an exponential growth of +ve cases",

In principle \u03bb should be constant if the curve follows exact exponential growth but in reality it may not follow. Therefore, we get non monotonic curve of \u03bb as a function of days instead of a horizontal curve. Another important point, as a simplified model, we have considered N 0 = 1 for each data points to see the approximate deviation in growth of cases. If we critically analyze the left panel of Fig. (1) , then we can identify a threshold date of different countries, after which a rapid growth is started. Here we see the day 32, 21, 37, 29, 17 may be roughly considered as the threshold day for India, Italy, USA, SK, and China respectively. At that point of time, their respective number of cases were 3, 3, 14, 33, 46. However if we are interested to identify the exponential growth then we have to focus on particular time axis zone, where a linear growth in our logarithmic figure (left Table 1 Table (1) . Extrapolating the last exponential growth of India and Italy is really a danger alert, but we should be fear on that extrapolation possibility until or unless the interventions, taken from those countries, will defeat this exponential growth.

Till now Covid-19 containment is not possible because vaccine is not available to stop the viral spreading. So we have to emphasize on mitigation (measures taken to slow it's spreading) measures/ interventions like lock-down; screening, testing and isolation of mass population; hand hygiene; using mask etc. Indian Govt declared lock down for 21 days from 23rd March to 14th April which is denoted by pink box in Fig. (3) . In the upper right panel of Fig. (3) we can see that data is till not achieved any sigmoid functions so it may be considered as part of exponential function or low t limit of sigmoid function. To achieve S 1 function with N max = 10 4 is quite challenging task to our country. Within the lock-down box, if we can see a rapid suppression then it is possible, otherwise we have to hope on S 2 and S 3 with N max = 10 5 and 10 6 , whose rapid deviation from exponential curve will be seen after lock-down period. It is only possible after extending the lock-down with more additional interventions. Hence coming data are very important to us and more critical analysis is required on those data. 5 All rights reserved.

Realistic data of different countries carry their own complexity, but still all of them has common trend that initially they follow very mild growth and then suddenly a rapid growth. After that rapid growth, they have a tendency to follow exponential pattern, which is well maintained in the data of India and Italy but the data of USA, China and South Korea follow very dynamical growth. Present article is intended to zoom in the straight forward alarm that exponential growth can cover entire population of India (Italy) within July (May) if it will be continued. In this regards, a positive hope can be found from the data profile of China and South Korea, whose transformation pattern from exponential growth function to a stable Sigmoid function is sketched and analyzed. As a positive hope from present interventions, mainly lock-down, considered by India Govt., we have sketched three possible Sigmoid functions, which can be saturated in either 10 4 or, 10 5 or, 10 6 . Within the lock-down period, we have not found any deviation trend from exponential to Sigmoid function till now. A rapid, intermediate and mild reduction can create a possibility of saturation within 10 4 , 10 5 and 10 6 but all of them never be achieved probably without extending lock-down. Apart from them, we might have to think about additional interventions for getting deviated from exponential to Sigmoid-type growth.",

For India and Italy, we notice this linear growth in log scale from t 0 =day 35 and 24. Right panel of Fig. (1) support this exponential growth by showing approximately constant values of \u03bb in the range day 35-57 (5th -27th March) and day 24-56 (24th Feb -27th March) for India and Italy respectively. On day 35 for India-data and day 24 for Italy-data the number of cases are 31 and 150, which are considered as N 0 of exponential growth function, described in Eq. (1). For India, Italy, we can find the exponential relation with \u03bb = 0.11, 0.22 by starting time axis from 5/March/20 and 24/Feb/20 respectively. If we noticed the right panel of Fig. (1), then we can see that after 5/March/20 and 24/Feb/20 i.e. after day 35 and 24 the \u03bb remain constant (0.11 and 0.22) for India and Italy. Although, we should remember that approximate constant \u03bb = 0.11, 0.22 within day 35-58, 24-56 for India, Italy are obtained when we crudely consider N 0 = 1. Actually we have to do exponential fitting within day 35-58, 22-56 with initial values N 0 = 31, 150 as shown in left panel of Fig. (2). For India, N 0 = 31, \u03bb = 0.14 can able to fit data within day 35-58. Hence, on 27th March or day 57, we will get N = N 0 e \u03bb(t\u2212t0) = 31 \u00d7 e 0.14\u00d7(57\u221235) \u2248 674, which is close to exact data 694. On the other hand, Italy-data within day 24-56 can be fitted by two sets -N 0 = 150, \u03bb = 0.31 in day 24-34 and N 0 = 3500, \u03bb = 0.15 in day 34-56. So, on 5th March or day 34, N = 150 \u00d7 e 0.31\u00d7(34\u221224) \u2248 3, 329, which is close to exact data 3, 089 and next, on 27th March or day 56, N = 3300 \u00d7 e 0.15\u00d7(56\u221234) \u2248 89, 471, which is close to exact data 86, 498.
