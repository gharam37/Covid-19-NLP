A study using Vero E6 cells found that treatment of the cells with chloroquine either before or after infection with SARS-CoV could prevent infection or treat the infected cells suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic effect (8) . The study found chloroquine disturbed the biochemical maturation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for SARS-CoV, and increased the pH of intracellular virus-laden vesicles inhibiting the viral normal multiplication processes. The receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is also highly predicted of being ACE2 (1) . In vitro studies for SARS-CoV-2 also found chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, a less-toxic derivative of chloroquine to be able to effectively inhibit viral growth (9) . They found the viral biological processes in the endosomes were affected by the anti-malarial agents. While the reported 50% effective concentration of the drugs are higher than the normal serum concentration reported in people taking these drugs, the concentrations in lungs and other vital organs are higher (10) . The most common side-effect of these are retinopathy and other side-effects precipitating due to higher concentrations of the compounds in blood.",

List of clinical trials registered in China were utilized in this study accessing with a ready-made excel spreadsheet from the Chinese clinical trial registry (12) , on 30 th March, 2020 provided in the website. The list of clinical trials registered in the US government clinical trial registry (13) were retrieved by searching \"coronavirus\" key word on 30 th March, 2020. All the trials were filtered out based on the presence of word \"chloroquine\" in the title irrespective of the chemical forms of the molecule (hydroxychloroquine) or trials being carried alone or in combination with other antivira therapies. Excel spreadsheet file was prepared based on various headings including intervention groups, randomization status, sample sizes, etc. Univariate statistics were used to report the methodologies of the trials. As of 30 th March 2020, 547 trials were registered in the Chinese clinical trial registry starting from 23 rd January, 2020. 25 (4.6%, 25/547) clinical trials used the word chloroquine in their titles. Five of them were reported to have been canceled, one was a prophylactic study and one another could not be retrieved. Eighteen (3.3%, 18/547) clinical trials from the Chinese registry were used for the downstream analysis. As of 30 th March 2020, 184 entries were obtained by searching for coronavirus related clinical trials in the US clinical trial registry of which only 153 were registered after 1 January 2020. Out of 153 registrations, 20 (13.1%, 20/153) were related to use of chloroquine. Four of these were registered from China, 3 from Brazil, 2 each from France, Mexico, US and Canada, and 1 each from Thailand, South Korea, United Kingdom, Norway and Turkey. Two of the studies from US, and 1 each from the United Kingdom, Mexico and Turkey were prophylactic study for healthy people at risk of infection. Thus 15 studies from US trial registry were used for analysis. Total 33 (18+15) clinical trials have been registered since 3rd February 2020. Six prophylactic studies were analyzed separately. ",

A non-randomized open-label clinical trial in France that enrolled hospitalized COVID-19 patients to the hydroxychloroquine (20 patients) and control arms (16 patients) concluded a positive effect of hydroxychloroquine or hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin based on viral negativity at day 6 (15) . Patients who didn't consent for hydroxychloroquine, had exclusion criteria (allergy to hydroxychloroquine, retinopathy, G6PD deficiency, QT prolongation and breast feeding/pregnacy) and were admitted to hospitals not using hydroxychloroquine, were grouped in the controlled arm. Six patients in the case arm also received azithromycin to prevent bacterial superinfection. Though the study had small sample size, was not randomized and didn't carry an intention-to-treat analysis, it concluded positive effects for hydroxychloroquine arm in spite of lesser proportion of \"asymptomatic\" patients (10% in hydroxychloroquine arm vs. 25% in control arm) and higher average age (51.2 years in hydroxychloroquine arm vs 37.3 years in control arm) in the intervention arm. Moreover, a secondary analysis (16) covering up for the weak statistical analyses by original authors found the azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine combination are was better compared to the control arm. Another study carried an open label randomized clinical trial in 30 Chinese COVID-19 patients treated with either hydroxychloroquine (15 patients) or conventional methods (15 patients) (17) . The study concluded no apparent benefit of hydroxychloroquine treatment compared to conventional treatment (86.7% treatment arm vs 93.3% control arm had negative viral conversion on day 7, p>0.05). But the authors reported using interferon alfa in all of the patients and 80% patients in each arm were treated with other antiviral therapies. Moreover, the authors cautioned the high recovery rate in control arm due to enrollment of mild cases could impact the comparison of efficacy of treatment arm. The third published study (as a preprint at the time of writing this manuscript) from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, (ChiCTR2000029559) claimed to find an positive effect of hydroxychloroquine in a double-blind randomized control design. 80.6% (25/31) patients in the treatment arm (400 mg hydroxychloroquine/day for 5 days) had improved pneumonia compared to 54.8% (17/31) in the control arms, along with other better outcome measures in the treatment arm (18) . Patients in both of the arms were reported to have been treated with other antivirals and antibiotics. A recent review found the inclusion of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine based therapy in the national guidelines of China, Korea, Netherlands, Italy, Canada and Belgium (19) . More recently, the US Food and Drug Administration has allowed an emergency use authorization for these drugs against COVID-19 when used by a valid health care provider (20) .",

The Spanish flu about one hundred years ago claimed about up to 50 million lives (21) as modern scientific knowledge were contemporarily lacking and limited. As predicted, in the absence of these measures, if 60% of global population were infected as forecasted by experts, and approximately 20% required treatment of chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulphate (22) , the cost could range tens of thousands USD per million population (Table 3) . (Table 4) . Thus more studies are warranted to confirm the efficacy and safety for use of these medications. In spite of that, continued efforts to try different dosages in ethically valid clinical trials is required for the assessment of effective and safe dosage administration. This can importantly contribute to guide the medical professionals for prescribing the accurate interventions and also contribute to pharmaceutical companies for deciding appropriate manufacturing pathways. While hydroxchloroquine has low dosage requirements and lesser side effects, the comparative price for complete prescribed treatment is more than five times of chloroquine phosphate (24) . While malaria is endemic in poor parts of the world, the prevalence is still too less than the panic and feared caused by prevalence of COVID-19 prompting pharmaceuticals for scaling up for the production of chloroquine. As chloroquine has significant adverse events, effective short-course dosing is very important. Moreover, both of these drugs are prescribed for weeks to months for various indications (8,11) and the interventions for short disease course (2 weeks for mild and 3-4 weeks for severe and critical cases) (22) of COVID-19 may not significantly hamper treatment. Other antiviral drugs in pipeline may not be very useful as their productions and supplies to the developing countries may require lengthy timeframe whereas mass production of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is already in place in malaria endemic developing countries.",
