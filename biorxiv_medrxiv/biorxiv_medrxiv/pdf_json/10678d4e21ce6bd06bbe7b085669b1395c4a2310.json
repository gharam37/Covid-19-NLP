The state of the epidemic at the end of the time unit is then related to that at the start through recurrence relationships. By propagating these relationships over the required number of time units, a projection can be made over time. The model is readily implemented on a spreadsheet and is therefore potentially widely accessible. It can serve as a useful tool for scenario planning and forecasting not just for an entire population, but also for a specific community within a population.",

Many of these are based on the SIR approach, but implemented in highly proprietary frameworks which are not readily accessible to third parties. Other approaches have also been used. For instance, Sanche et al. (2020) proposed that, if the basic reproduction number R0 is 6.7, then even \"if as low as 20% of infected persons are asymptomatic and can transmit the virus, then even 95% quarantine efficacy will not be able to contain the virus\". However, Sanche et al.'s (2020) findings were based on the basic theory on the force of infection, rather than a full simulation and focused on the asymptomatic cases. Hence, it is a partial model. Furthermore, current understanding appear to suggest that infectivity is probably much higher amongst the symptomatic cases, especially within the first three days of symptoms onset, compared to the asymptomatic case (WHO 2020). Kermack and McKendrick's (1927) original SIR model was expressed in closed-form mathematical relationships. Individual researchers are now much more empowered in terms of computing facilities than their predecessors in Kermack and",

            "text": "Less is known about the detection efficiency k. Niehus et al.'s (2020) postulation only relates to the relative (rather than absolute) detection capacity and they noted that Singapore's detection capacity is likely to be less than 100% (or 1.0) and some other countries may be much lower. One way to backestimate k is through the geometric rate of increase. If we assume a median value of r ~1.5, based on the discussion above, then k can be estimated by back-fitting the \u03b1-value, Table 1 . As Table 1 shows, Singapore's back-fitted detection efficiency k is significantly higher than that of China (in the early stage) and the US. This is consistent with Niehus et al.'s (2020) postulated that \"\u2026the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22% -64%) of Singapore's capacity\". The current backfitted results indicate a somewhat higher percentage (53%) instead of 38%. Nonetheless, the trend is generally correct and it explains the slower rise in infected cases in Singapore. Moreover, the detection rate of 35.5% for China is also reasonably consistent with Wang et al.'s (2020) finding that \"at least 59% of infected cases were unascertained in Wuhan\". The latter would imply a detection efficiency of 41% or less. Fig. 6 shows the cumulative number of cases from dormitory clusters, non-dormitory clusters and unlinked cases from 30 March 2020 till 9 April 2020. As can be seen, both the non-dormitory clusters and unlinked cases plot to almost the same gradient, implying almost equal \u03b1-value, which can be fitted using k = 0.54. This suggests a possible decrease in the detection efficiency from the initial high value of 0.67. The alternative explanation is an increase in r-value, but this seems rather unlikely since the social setting, virological characteristics and infectious period have not changed. However, there may be some over-estimation of the unlinked cases as some of these might have been subsequently linked to existing clusters or cases. The dormitory clusters show a much higher \u03b1-value. Since the kvalue is unlikely to be different for this group, compared to the non-dormitory clusters and unlinked cases, the only alternative explanation is a higher value of r (=2.2).",

This indicates the projection results are consistent with conventional wisdom as well as data of COVID 19 cases. For instance, inFig. 3,initial Chinese data show a doubling once every ~1.5 days. Substituting S\u0394N = 2 and \u0394N = 1.5 gives \u03b1 = 0.462. The US data show a doubling once every ~2.5days, indicating that \u03b1 = 0.277.

That is, within the first 3 days from onset of symptoms. Preliminary data suggests that people may be more contagious around the time of symptom onset as compared to later on in the disease\u2026\u2026.The incubation period for COVID-19, which is the time between exposure to the virus (becoming infected) and symptom onset, is on average 5-6 days, however can be up to 14 days. During this period, also known as the \"presymptomatic\" period, some infected persons can be contagious. Therefore, transmission from a presymptomatic case can occur before symptom onset. In a small number of case reports and studies, pre-symptomatic transmission has been documented through contact tracing efforts and enhanced investigation of clusters of confirmed cases. This is supported by data suggesting that some people can test positive for COVID-19 from 1-3 days before they develop symptoms\u2026.Thus, it is possible that people infected with COVID-19 could transmit the virus before significant symptoms develop. It is important to recognize that pre-symptomatic transmission still requires the virus to be spread via infectious droplets or through touching contaminated surfaces\u2026\u2026An asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed case is a person infected with COVID-19 who does not develop symptoms\u2026.Asymptomatic transmission refers to transmission of the virus from a person, who does not develop symptoms. There are few reports of laboratory-confirmed cases who are truly asymptomatic, and to date, there has been no documented asymptomatic transmission.
