As a hopeful extrapolation, the existing data might be considered low time-axis values of Sigmoid-type function, whose growth might be saturated to values of 10 4 or 10 5 . To fulfill this expectation, a turning from increasing to decreasing trend in new case data should be noticed around April-May, which definitely demand extension of present lock-down with additional interventions.",

It remain quite gentle up to February and limited within Kerala but from beginning of March, it spread to other states and union territories of India. During the month of March the number of covid19 cases get an exponential growth tendency. On the identification of exponential growth trend and its possible deviation via Sigmoid function [3] for India data has been attempted in our earlier work [4] .

We noticed in MH-panel of Fig. (1) , that last slope parameter is \u03bb = 0.16, which was previously \u03bb = 0.43. This larger to lower exponential transformation is definitely a good signal for MH but further extension of last exponential growth is so dangerous that it can cover full population of MH within the end of June, 2020. In the upper left panel of Fig. (2) , the pink dotted line represent that exponential growth, where number of population (NoP) in MH is marked by red arrow. However, proper interventions like lock-down, maintaining self precautions can transform the exponential to Sigmoid-type profile. Considering two guess values N max = 10 4 , 10 5 , where total cases might be saturated due to undertaking interventions, we can get two Sigmoid functions S 1 and S 2 respectively, shown by blue dash and black solid lines. Time derivative of exponential function and Sigmoid functions will give corresponding new case predictions, which is shown in lower left panel of Fig. (2) with same line styles as considered in upper panel for total case plots. New case data of MH is also included. They are quite fluctuating but matched roughly with low t range of exponential and Sigmoid functions. For predicted hopeful functions S 1 and S 2 , the turning of new cases from increasing to decreasing trend has to be seen around end of April and mid of May. Number of Beds (NoB) in Govt. hospitals in different states are documented in the Ref. [9] . For MH, this number is shown by green dash line in left upper and lower panels of Fig. (2) .",

Except KL remaining of them have been detected first covid19 positive cases from the beginning of March. Using this one month existing data of total and new cases for different states, we have attempted to visualize their future trends. Identifying the last trend of exponential growth of different states, we have listed their slope parameters (\u03bb) from their respective time dependent total case plot. Though we have arranged our descriptions from MH to WB, based on total no of cases in an ascending order but they don't have same ascending order in their slope parameters, which is very important quantity for future spreading. In that context, TN, AP, MP, WB, having higher slope parameters, might face rapid growth of positive cases, while states having low slope parameter, like GJ, HR, PB might face slow growth. To zoom in the disaster side of this exponential growth we have extrapolated the total cases based on the last slope parameters and we estimated approximate months when entire population of the states might be infected. Due to the high slope parameter, TN and AP might reach this picture within May while WB, DL, TG, KL, MH, RJ, MP might reach on June, then UP, GJ on August; HR on September; PB on November. This order probably reflect the ranking of states, based on interventions, maintained by state residents.",

We consider the two guess values 10 4 and 10 5 , where total cases might be saturated due to undertaking interventions. Then we have plotted two Sigmoid-type profile in time axis. With respect to existing data for available beds in Govt. hospitals, JK, HR, PB are in little high risk zone in comparison to others as the rough values of their no. of beds remain lower than saturation number of Sigmoid functions. Interestingly, their high risk might be reduced by their ongoing undertaking interventions, for which their last trend of exponential growth have very small slope parameters. On the other hand WB, TN, AP due to their large values of Govt. hospital beds, seems to be in low risk zone but in the same time we should not ignore their high risk possibility because of their large slope parameter, noticed in their data. As we know that Sigmoid-type profile in total cases can create a peak structure in new case profile, which means that after a certain time, increasing trend of new cases can be converted to decreasing trend. To get saturation in total cases of 10 4 and 10 5 , maximum states have to face the turning from increasing to decreasing trend in new cases around April or May. However, this time for HR and PB might be relaxed to June or August due to their lower slope parameters.",

In that case, a turning possibility in new cases at the end of the April or May might be expected.
