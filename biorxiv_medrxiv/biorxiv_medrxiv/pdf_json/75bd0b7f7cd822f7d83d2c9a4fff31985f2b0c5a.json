Since prediction of buried group pKas is computationally intensive, solvent accessibility of ionisable groups is displayed, from which the user can iteratively select pKa calculation centers. Results are color-coded, with emphasis on buried groups. Utility is demonstrated with coronaviruses, which exhibit variable dependence on the acidic pH of the endocytotic pathway. After benchmarking with variants of murine hepatitis virus, a pair of conserved histidine residues are identified that are predicted to be electrostatically frustrated at acidic pH in a common structural core of pre-and post-fusion coronavirus spike proteins.",

However, conformational change often depends on the electrostatic frustration (destabilization) that develops when a buried group cannot ionize at a pH where it would in a more solvent accessible conformation (Narayan and Naganathan, 2018) . We reasoned that a web tool focusing on buried ionizable groups would be useful for studying pH-dependent conformational change, and have adapted our existing mixed finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann (FDPB) and DH model. Here, the server is demonstrated with coronaviruses, some of which use the endocytotic pathway for membrane fusion, whereas others fuse at the plasma membrane. We focus on the pre-to post-fusion conformational changes in the S2 part of the spike protein, that mediates membrane fusion (Heald-Sargent and Gallagher, 2012).",

Upon upload of a structure, the user is presented with a color-coded display (NGL viewer, Rose et al., 2018) of solvent accessible surface area (ASA) values for ionizable groups. A user iteratively specifies centers, around which pKa calculations are made for spheres of radius 25 \u00c5 (about the size of lysozyme). Edge effects do not have a big effect on predicted pKas towards the sphere centre. Results for Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg, His accumulate as more centers are added, and are color-coded to show whether a group is stabilizing or destabilizing, assessed from the difference between calculated and intrinsic pKa (capped at -5 and 5). Users may either use ionisable group ASA/burial or literature knowledge of interesting sites, to select pKa calculation centers. It is envisaged that the server will allow a user to quickly survey a set of structures for potential pH-dependence hotspots, rather than provide a great depth of analysis for each structure.",

A pre-fusion structure for MHV A59 is also available (3jcl, Walls et al., 2016) . In a variant of mouse hepatitis virus type 4 (MHV4), spike protein Q1015H, Q1042H (MHV A59 numbering) and one further mutation (L to R) render the virus pH-dependent, via the endocytotic pathway (Gallagher et al., 1991) . Modelling the mutations to histidine in the MHV A59 background, we find they are predicted to be buried in the pre-fusion form (destabilizing, not shown) and exposed in the post-fusion structure (not destabilizing, Fig. 1a ). Color schemes for ASA and pKa-related stabilization are given (Fig. 1b) . Our results are consistent with the relief of electrostatic frustration at endosomal pH biasing conformation away from the pre-fusion structure. The story is a little more complicated, since the MHV4 variant also loses fusion activity at neutral pH (Gallagher et al., 1991) , which could be due to additional stabilization of the pre-fusion form with pH-independent histidine interactions.

If H1098 and/or H1114 were solvent exposed and protonated, then relief from frustration in a conformational intermediate could play a role in facilitating transfer between post-and pre-fusion structures in coronaviruses that use the endocytotic pathway, including SARS-CoV-2 (Ou et al., 2020) . In this proposal, H1098/H1114 assistance in crossing the pre-to post-fusion conformational barrier would be available to those viruses that are unable to fuse at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, both H1098A and H1114A mutations in MHV A59 prevented virus growth (Li et al., 2018) , perhaps indicative of (pH-independent) packing stabilizations in their buried environments, so that evolutionary retention for fusion could be afforded by a more direct structural imperative. This would be in line with the coupling of factors that determine infection pathways, including spike protein stability, receptor binding, proteolytic cleavage, as well as endosomal pH (Heald-Sargent and Gallagher, 2012; Millet and Whittaker, 2015) . If the proposed loosening around the conserved post-and pre-fusion core is borne out, then although it may not be universally necessary (in pH-dependent entry), it could be the basis for a novel, albeit transient, coronavirus drug target.",
