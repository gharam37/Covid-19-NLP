No evidence was showed for sexual transmission or intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia. However, according to the recent bioinformatic evidence [9, 10] , the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a target for 2019-nCoV infection, is predominantly enriched in human testes, raising the urgent question of viral sexual transmission and paternal transmission route among males. Answer to this question is essential for formulating the principles of treatment and guidelines of sexual behavior when restored for men with 2019-nCoV infection. Therefore, to explore the possibility of sexual transmission of this contagious virus from male, we examined the viral RNA in semen and testicular biopsy specimen respectively from 12 patients in recovery and one patients died in the acute phase of 2019-nCov infection.

Also, recent studies have found that ACE2 is highly expressed in spermatogonia, Leydig and Sertoli cells in the human testis by single-cell transcriptome and bioinformatics analysis, and speculated that human testes are a potential target of 2019-nCov infection [9, 10] . However, consistent with our study, the previous systematical study reported that the cells in testis cannot be infected by SARS-CoV despite the expression of high levels of ACE2 [26] . On the other hand, although few studies previously reported orchitis as a complication of SARS [27] , which mostly due to the continuous high fever and virus-induced autoimmune response among severe patients. Hence, the presence of orchitis among SARS-infected patients could not be concluded as the virus directly targeted the testes. Further mechanism investigation of the potential virus attacks on the testes is warranted.",

Expending our understanding of the transmission routes of the viral infection is crucial in controlling the outbreak in the community. Similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, the COVID-19 infection causes a series of respiratory illness at visit, which indicates the virus most likely infects respiratory epithelial cells and spreads mainly via respiratory tract and contact transmission. In addition, the incidence of less common gastrointestinal manifestations like diarrhea, nausea and vomiting",

Most of them were categorized into mild/common subgroups (11 patients); one was categorized into asymptomatic subgroup. Seven patients presented with a fever during hospitalization, only one patient had a high fever with 39\u00b0C(Patient 11), other patients' body temperatures fluctuated within a range of 36.5-38.5\u00b0C. Other symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection were also observed: four patients had a cough, one patient had shortness of breath, and one reported a sore throat. Additionally, four patients had fatigue, one patient had a headache and one had a chest distress. Of the 12 patients, all of them underwent chest computed tomography (CT) on admission. The most common patterns on chest CT were patchy shadowing (5/12, 41.7%) and stripe shadows (3/12, 25.0%). Two (16.7%) patients showed ground-glass opacity in lungs. CT scans of the rest 2 (16.7%) patients showed normal images. All these patients were treated with antiviral therapy, 7 (58.3%) patients received antibiotic therapy. Three (25.0%) patients received intravenous corticosteroid therapy. Three (25%) patients received interferon therapy. One (8.3%) patient received immunoglobulin therapy. As of March 14, 2020, a total of 10 cases (83.3%) discharged from the hospital while the rest 2 had developed into recovery stage (Patient 4 has cleared the virus, while Patient 1 has the symptoms lessened and the recent chest CT showed a substantial resolution) and were kept in hospital for further observation. For the dead patient (Patient 13), he had a fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, chest distress and dyspnea during hospitalization. The CT scans showed a patchy shadowing image. Except for the usual drugs, he was admitted to ICU in February 14, 2020 and received mechanical ventilation therapy. Unfortunately, the patient died at March 10, 2020. Nucleic acid and antibody test among all specimens during hospitalization were recorded in Figure 1. Among the 12 patients in recovery, all of the 9 patients were tested for IgM negative and IgG positive. Eight of them have cleared the virus when the IgG turned positive, while only one patient (Patient 1) kept nucleic acid positive on pharyngeal swab specimens. Four patients (Patient 9, 10, 11 and 12) kept nucleic acid negative but with IgG positive during hospitalization. The dead patient (Patient All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
