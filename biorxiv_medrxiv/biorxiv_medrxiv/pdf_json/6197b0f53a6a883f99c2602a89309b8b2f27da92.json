In this paper, the deep studying based totally methodology is usually recommended for the detection of COVID-19 infected patients using X-ray images. The help vector gadget classifies the corona affected X-ray images from others through usage of the deep features. The technique is useful for the clinical practitioners for early detection of COVID-19 infected patients. The suggested system of multi-level thresholding plus SVM presented high accuracy in classification of the infected lung with Covid-19. All images were of the same size and stored in JPEG format with 512 * 512 pixels. The average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the lung classification using the proposed model results were 95.76%, 99.7%, and 97.48%, respectively.",

As indicated by the World Health Organization (WHO), Coronaviruses belong to a large family that varies from cold to serious disease [1, 8] . These diseases can affect humans and animals. The strain that began to spread in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei region, was identified from two completely different Coronaviruses namely, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS).

The amount of data produced from the dawn of humankind through 2003 is generated today within a few minutes.

These means of COVID-19 medical diagnosis include clinical characteristics and radiologist's diagnosis. Clinical characteristics involves human temperature monitoring and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [9] . Based on the human body temperature, patients' body temperatures range within ranges of 36\u00b75-38\u00b78\u00b0C [11] . Accordingly, available thermal sensors or thermal images can be collected as instantaneous data to investigate the potential COVID-19 [8] . Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a laboratory technique that is used for testing COVID-19 using a blood sample of the case. Using real time RT-PCR test confirms the actual number of confirmed cases globally [13, 14] . Moreover, point-of-care testing, Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and detection of antibodies can be applied to detecting infected cases [6, 16] .",

However, this approach needs a CDC guide's sample collection, qualified microbiology expertise, time from 4hrs up to 6hrs. Therefore, medical imaging is very important candidate in screening for the COVID-19 cases [17] . Radiologist's diagnosis involves computed tomography (CT) scans, chest X-ray (CXR) radiographs [10] . COVID-19 symptoms can be effectively detected using CT or X-ray images. Based on the chest CT scans During recovery, radiologists can detect the (COVID-19) pneumonia and the stage of patient recovery or deterioration. Automated artificial intelligence models can accurately provide early detection for the diagnosis of the cases of COVID-19 by detecting the early lung damage signs in the images. An inception artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been applied for binary classification for infected with COVID-19 or health persons using 1,119 CT images [18] . The modified the Inception transfer-learning model produced accuracy of 89.5% with 0.88 and 0.87 for specificity and sensitivity, respectively using internal validation dataset. On the other hand, model produced accuracy of 79.3% with 0.83 and 0.67for specificity and sensitivity, respectively using external validation dataset. Therefore, the findings demonstrate the reliability of deep learning to find COVID-19 radiological features based on terms of time and accuracy.",

Isolation and social distance are temporary unpractical solution against fighting COVID-19. Unfortunately, a coronavirus vaccine is expected to take at least 18 months if it works at all. Moreover, COVID -19 pandemics can mutate into a more aggressive form [8] . Therefore, this paper presents a novel COVID-19 detecting methodology based on multilevel thresholding and SVM for X-ray images. The technique is useful for the clinical practitioner for early detection of COVID-19 infected patient. The model presents high accuracy where the average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the lung classification were 95.76%, 99.7%, and 97.48%, respectively. Machine learning algorithms can present high performance in terms of accuracy and computational complexity [26] . Therefore, the future research may be based on using a modified model of optimized SVM or hybrid ML models. Moreover, larger data set can be providing higher model generalization.",
