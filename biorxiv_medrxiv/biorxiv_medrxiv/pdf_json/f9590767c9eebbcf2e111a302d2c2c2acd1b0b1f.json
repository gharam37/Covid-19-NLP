A strategy is needed such that both the health system is not overloaded letting people die in an uncontrolled way and also such that the majority of people can get back their social contacts as soon as possible. We investigate the potential effects of a combination of measures such as continuation of hygienic constraints after leaving lockdown, isolation of infectious persons, repeated and adaptive short-term contact reductions and also large-scale use of antibody tests in order to know who can be assumed to be immune and participate at public life without constraints. We apply two commonly used modeling approaches: extended SEIR models formulated both as System Dynamics and Agent-Based Simulation, in order to get insight into the disease dynamics of a complete country like Germany and also into more detailed behavior of smaller regions. We confirm the findings of other models that without intervention the consequences of the pandemic can be catastrophic and we extend such findings with effective strategies to overcome the challenge. Based on the modeling assumptions it can be expected that repeated short-term contact reductions will be necessary in the next years to avoid overload of the health system and that on the other side herd immunity can be achieved and antibody tests are an effective way to mitigate the contact reductions for many.",

From a medical point of view, seroconversion, i.e., positivity of IgM/IgG antibodies can be detected as early as 7-14 days after symptomatic COVID-19 infection [3] . However, since many patients can still shed oral infectious virus up to 22 days after onset of symptoms or after first positive COVID-19 PCR test result [3] , sole positivity of combined IgM/IgG is not a good indicator for non-infectious individuals and herd immunity. In this respect, isolated detection of virus-specific IgG should be preferred, because it has a delayed kinetic in comparison to IgM. Furthermore, with respect to disease modeling and contagiousness a safety buffer of 14 days added on the date of IgG positivity may be reasonable in order to define a reliable time-point when a person should be considered recovered and non-infectious. Another important variable of antibody tests is their specificity and sensitivity. For the reliable calculation of herd immunity a high specificity of an antibody test is critical and should be >99%. Also, an extremely high sensitivity of the antibody test might be desirable and nice to have. However, it is not of critical importance, as it can be assumed that most people with a functioning herd immunity also have sufficiently high antibody levels.",

            "text": "In order to find strategies to defeat the pandemic, epidemiological models are used to support decision making. In general, there are two main modeling approaches: an aggregate view based on a system of differential equations, also known as System Dynamics (SD) and an individual-based simulation, also known as Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) [4] . SD models can describe dynamics on an abstract level, people in certain states are represented by their number and for the solution just an ordinary system of differential equations needs to be solved. Standard solvers are available, the size of the system is normally quite small (up to a few ten equations) and a fast, immediate response is possible. In ABS, each individual is modeled explicitly allowing for stochastic and more detailed behavior, underlying is however discrete-event simulation causing higher computational costs (note that also repetitions of the simulations are needed in order to get statistically reliable results). Depending on the goals a suitable modeling approach can be selected. It is also possible to combine both, as an example of hybrid simulation, which has already been applied successfully in healthcare simulations [5] . It should be noted that an SD model corresponds to an ABS where all agents are represented by a Markov chain with the same states as the SD model and the number of agents is taken to infinity [4] . Therefore, all timing in SD is implicitly exponentially distributed. By splitting the SD variables it is also possible to represent phase type distributions such as the Erlang distribution which is less variant [6] . This allows for more realism in SD models. Most models extend well-known SEIR models [7, 8] with the states susceptible, exposed (infected but not yet infectious), infectious, and recovered. In SD models each equation describes the change of the number of people in theses states and in ABS each agent has these internal states.",

These models describe the dynamics of the disease and the effects of certain interventions. For this purpose efforts have been undertaken to get important model parameters such as basic reproduction number, incubation period, case fatality risk, others cannot be accessed and must be estimated, e.g., percentage of contact rate reductions when interventions are implemented or the percentage of isolated cases. It is however clear that at this stage of the pandemic there are many uncertainties about these parameters, including the manifestation index, fatality rates as well as age-and risk-stratified numbers. In this paper we use those models as a reference in order to adequately model the disease dynamics, adapt them to current data and then add further aspects for investigating exit strategies based on a set of measures.",

            "text": "The contribution of this paper is to investigate for a country like Germany combinations of measures in order to get an effective exit strategy and to meet the important goals mentioned above. We will thus investigate the following scenarios: disease dynamics if no lockdown would have been imposed, an exit of the lockdown without successive measures, hygienic constraints imposed after lockdown, and repetitive and adaptive but short-term social contact restrictions. Isolation of infectious people, seasonality of contagiousness, and immunity of a large fraction of the population is also considered. Antibody tests are used in order to let return people with assumed immunity to public life without contact reductions. Since such tests are a scarce resource it will not be possible to test all people systematically. Therefore it will be necessary to develop strategies such that a positive effect can be achieved. One approach is to give people from risk groups or from system relevant sectors preference, such as health personnel. A second approach is to follow infection chains and identify people who might have been infected but were asymptomatic (digital contact tracing could help here). If that is possible, these people will be also tested with preference leading to a higher fraction of people able to reenter public life. We will first examine these strategies with an extended SD model in order to get main hints. We will then show an ABS model for a prototypical region with different classes of people. The ABS model will be used in followup work to check whether properties of testing are sufficient or must be improved. In the SD model all effects are aggregated in rates for the complete population, whereas in the ABS individual contacts between people in families, at work, in hospitals, and in leisure are modeled. Thus the ABS allows to draw conclusions also for the availability of personnel in hospitals and in companies. This also allows for planning over the time during and after lockdown. Both models have been realized with the simulation framework AnyLogic 2 .",

Using China as an example, this influence is examined in [14] with an extended SIR model and in [15] with an extended SEIR model. The agent-based simulation model [16] examines the influence of interventions on the spread of the virus in Singapore.

The basic reproduction number R 0 is estimated to lie between 2.4 and 3.3, WHO estimates for China a range between 2 and 2.5 (without interventions). We assume a value of 3 to reflect the recorded cases in Germany. As in [10] we also allow for seasonal changes according to a sine function. For the incubation period (from infection to sickness) on the average 5 to 6 days can be assumed (range 1 -14) . For the latency period (from infection to being infectious) no results are given, we thus assume 3 days. The infection period can be assumed to start 2.5 days before onset of symptoms, the duration is unclear. Since the severity and duration of cases differ we calculate the infection period weighted by the number of cases (both symptomatic and asymptomatic), resulting in an average of 12.5 days including the prodromal period. Symptomatic period in mild or moderate cases is assumed to be 9 days according to [10] , we take the same time for asymptomatic cases. For the time from onset of symptoms to hospitalization an average of 4 is reported (with an interquartile range IQR of 2 -7) and from hospitalization to ICU on the average 1 day (IQR 0 -3). For the hospitalization time of severe cases and for the time in ICU we assume 14 and 10 days respectively as in [10] .

Persons in recovered are assumed to be immune and cannot be infected again. The state infectious has substates: first there is the state prodromal in which no or only mild symptoms are shown, afterwards there is a split between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. The symptomatic ones are further split into mild, severe, and critical, the last two of them are again subdivided into sequential states at home, hospitalized, and ICU. We also divide the recovered state into the substates was_asymptomatic and was_symptomatic, a separation which we need for the antibody tests. At each time instance the state chart is in exactly one state, for every (sub-)state without substates either a sojourn time distribution (e.g., latency period in exposed) or an event (e.g., infection by another person in susceptible) for leaving the state must be defined. In case of more than one outgoing arrow of a state, switching probabilities are required. For instance, persons leaving the substates of state infectious have different probabilities to get either back to susceptible (if the person is not immune afterwards, by default this probability is set to zero) or to recovered or dead. All necessary information for such sojourn times and switching probabilities can be obtained from the data mentioned in the previous paragraph.

The total number of companies is an input parameter that allows to generate large and small companies.

For example, hospital staff and system-relevant workers can be tested with a higher priority. Input configuration allows to preset a sensitivity and a specificity value for the test. For a more precise analysis, it is even possible to consider different error probabilities for agents that are affected and have not been recovered yet. Fig. 3 shows a screenshot of the model with 20.000 agents, the agents are shown as icons in their environments, colors represent their states. The model can deal with several ten thousand agents easily and is ready to study effects in a region, but differentiated for the agent groups. It is for instance possible to derive figures of health personnel with ABs. It will also easily be possible to include other important aspects into the ABS model: age-dependent severity and CFRs, controlled change of social status (from reduced to normal) depending on vulnerability (e.g., elderly and other risk groups), viral load at infections (can influence severity), etc. Resource-based analysis can show, if enough beds, hospital staff, or system-relevant workers are available when the pandemic gets more severe. It would also be interesting to model regional clusters with ABS and connect them via continuous flows or to provide an SD environment with the general disease dynamics for the ABS model of a region, similar as in [5] .",

Fig. 5 shows the dynamics under this assumption. As can be seen, the ICU utilization is highly exceeded (ca. 400K at its peak). Thus, this scenario would lead to a fairly higher number of deaths than shown in the figure because of significant overload of ICU capacities since we do not model maximum capacities but only reflect the required numbers. We now investigate the effect of these initial interventions between March 22 and April 19, without successive interventions, as illustrated in Fig. 6 . We can see that the peak is only shifted to the right but not significantly reduced. This is a strong indication that the interventions cannot be released without substitution. Fig. 7 shows a scenario where the population is required to keep hygienic constraints (e.g., by using mouthpieces). It can be seen that the curve is clearly flattened, but the ICU utilization is still significantly too high (ca. 300K). The contact index shows the restrictions for the population by about 10% due to these hygienic measures but also that they can be reduced over time due to increasing immunization.",

This can easily be changed to other values or other indicators such as the number of deaths per day. This behavior can be directly transferred to reality by monitoring the utilization of the available ICU capacity and apply interventions if this number exceeds or falls below a certain threshold. Due to the delay when interventions affect the number of infections, we need to apply a threshold of 18.5K to ensure that the ICU capacity is not exceeded.

We assume the same combination of interventions as in the last scenario (adaptive contact restrictions after the lockdown, hygienic measures).

The effect with a capacity of 100K is illustrated in Fig. 9 . As can be seen, up to 5.4M people can be excluded additionally from interventions with these tests (compared to 25.4M without tests). With a lower number of tests, e.g., 50K per day, we would still be able to exclude 4.4M people. If we apply these tests with preference to system-relevant groups, we can significantly improve public life (as a reference, ca. 1M nurses and related jobs are registered in Germany 10 ). If we assume a more pessimistic value for the test sensitivity (75%), the effects are marginally reduced. With 50K tests per day, we would still be able to exclude 4M additional people.

This in turn would lead to more infections and in turn to more asymptomatic recovered and thus increase the likelihood of finding people with antibodies, making the tests more effective and excluding more people from interventions. However, we have not added figures for these scenarios because the ICU capacities would be exceeded and the number of deaths would increase significantly, as discussed in the previous scenarios. Fig. 10 and 11 demonstrate how the virus spreading would be affected if a seasonality factor is in place, meaning that the virus spreads less in summer and more in winter months, or if a significant portion of the population is immune to the virus. The seasonality is modeled as sine curve, as also explained in the Appendix. The figures show the dynamics with no antibody testing in place, the number of immune people and thus the contact index could be improved with the previously described measure by the number of unknown immune people tracked by the bottom right curve. We omitted the graphics for space reasons but the number of additionally identified immune people behaves nearly identically as with the effect shown in Fig. 8 and 9 . As we can see, the dynamics of the virus are similar, the disease will still spread fast after April 19 and would exceed ICU capacities. The main difference is the number of interventions that will be required, which reduces from 9 to 6 (for seasonality) or 5 (for initially immune people). If an initial immunity of one third of the population is assumed, the last intervention is already in November 2021.
