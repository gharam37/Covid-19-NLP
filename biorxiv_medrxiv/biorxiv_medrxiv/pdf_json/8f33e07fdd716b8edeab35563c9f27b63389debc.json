To facilitate the evaluation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, we generated a publicly accessible database of epitopes predicted to bind any class I HLA protein across the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. While a subset of epitopes from earlier betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV (SARS), have been validated experimentally, validation systems are often biased toward specific HLA haplotypes (notably HLA-A*02:01) that only account for a fraction of the haplotypes of individuals affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To enable evaluation of epitopes across individuals with a variety of HLA haplotypes, we computed the predicted binding affinities between 9-mer peptides derived from the annotated SARS-CoV-2 peptidome across 9,360 MHC class I HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles. There were 6,748 unique combinations of peptides and HLA alleles (pMHCs) with a predicted binding affinity of less than 500nM, including 1,103 unique peptides and 1,022 HLA alleles, spanning 11 annotated superfamilies. These peptides were derived from all 11 proteins spanning the SARS-CoV-2 peptidome, including peptides that have previously been validated experimentally.

It is possible that patients who have the most severe forms of the disease, including ARDS, may have an increased functionality of CD8 T cells recognizing specific antigens presented by one of their HLAs, which could be specifically studied using the predicted epitopes described herein. In addition, preventive vaccines may require monitoring not only the induction of an antibody response, which is usually delayed, but also an earlier CD8 T cell response to specific antigens within the context of the patient's HLA subtypes. Given the global reach of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this database of predicted HLA class I binding peptides may serve as a guide to identify and monitor phenotypic, functional and kinetic responses of putative SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T cells across patients with a broad range of HLA haplotypes internationally.",
