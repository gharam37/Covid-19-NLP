This is the first double-blinded, randomized clinical trial addressing different dosages of CQ for the treatment of severe patients with COVID-19 in the absence of a control group using placebo. Due to the impossibility of not using the drug recommended at the national level, we used historical data from the literature to infer comparisons for lethality endpoints.

Among patients randomized to the lower dosage group (5 days of treatment, total dose 2.7 g), given the limited number of patients so far enrolled, it is still not possible to estimate a clear benefit of CQ in patients with severe ARDS. Preliminary data on viral clearance in respiratory secretions in our confirmed cases are also indicative of little effect of the drug at high dosage. More studies initiating CQ prior to the onset of the severe phase of the disease are urgently needed.",

Our study raises enough red flags to stop the use of such dosage (12g of CQ in total, for 10 days, due to the presentation of CQ tablets, 150mg, from Farmanguinhos) worldwide in order to avoid more unnecessary deaths. We were not able to independently assess the toxic role of azithromycin because all patients were already using this antibiotic as per hospital protocol.

A decade later, in 2012, a second highly pathogenic coronavirus, the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerged in countries in the Middle East 5 . The virus was first isolated in June 2012 5 . By the end of 2016, more than 1850 cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV had been documented, with a case fatality rate of 35% 6 . The first cases of the new coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) were reported in December 2019, when a group of patients was admitted to hospitals in Wuhan, the capital of the Hubei province in Central China, with an initial diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown etiology 7 .

Few treatment studies have been carried out because most strains of human coronavirus cause selflimiting disease, and routine supportive care is usually effective. For past severe strains of coronavirus, outbreaks were scattered, thus not allowing timely clinical trials. Since the 2002 SARS outbreak, new therapeutic agents targeting viral entry pathways, proteins, proteases, polymerases and methyltransferases have been tested in randomized clinical trials, with little success. Recent publications have drawn attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine sulphate and phosphate salts (chloroquine diphosphate-CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients 16-21 . Both drugs historically have been used for the treatment of acute malaria, as well as in some chronic rheumatic conditions. HCQ, a derivative of CQ first synthesized in 1946, proved to be less (~40%) toxic when used for longer periods of time than the three-day course recommended for malaria. HCQ is therefore one of the drugs recommended for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis 22 . Although both drugs have a bitter taste, they are generally very well tolerated, and after millions of doses used, their accumulated safety database is massive.",
