A description of the time dependence of the disease expansion and a method to evaluate trends of the expansion are proposed. Several features are observed in the data, namely a high predictability of the expansion of disease in Italy and a convergence of the \"pushback\" parameter towards a limiting value in all the countries where restrictive measures have been adopted. Basic predictions for the evolution of the disease expansion are made for selected countries with a stable evolution in the parametric space of the model. The findings presented here should contribute to the understanding of the behavior of the disease expansion and the role of the restrictive measures on the evolution of the expansion.",

In this paper we propose a straightforward analytic description of the time dependence of the disease expansion under the restrictive measures and a method allowing to identify trends in the expansion and make predictions. The analytic parametric modeling can be used as an alternative to complex models for the disease expansion such as those reviewed e.g. in Ref. [2] .",

The quality of the fits then decides which of the approximation serves as the best description of the data.

This can be done by fitting the data in time windows or by fitting the data between the time of the beginning and a given time t. The former method is more susceptible to fluctuations of the data which may occur within the time windows while the latter method may be biased by the change of the parameters in time. We tested both of these methods as well as various sizes of the time window with the conclusion that fitting from the beginning leads to less fluctuating values of parameters which exhibit the same trends and tend to converge to the same values as the values of parameters analyzed by fits in time windows. From now on, we therefore evaluate the evolution of parameters b 1 , b 2 , and N 0 by fitting from the beginning up to a time t indicated on the x-axis of plots. The evolution of parameters b 1 , b 2 , and N 0 is shown in upper left and lower panels of Figure 1 . One can see that parameters are highly oscillating at the beginning but then for times greater than 20 days since the first registered The parameter b 1 can be interpreted as a parameter quantifying the uncontrolled spread of the disease.

The analysis presented here obviously cannot answer these questions. At the same time, it allows us to assess the efficiency of applying the existing measures. For example, if we observe that the parameter b 2 achieves a limiting value of Italy even in countries where more restrictive measures have been applied, such as mandatory usage of masks in Czechia, then this indicates that the use of these measures does not bring further reduction of the spread of the disease 1 .",

Fits ignore data from first five days and data with number of cases smaller than 100. Parameters of the fit: N 0 (upper right), b 1 (lower left), and b 2 (lower right) evaluated as a function of time since the first detection in a given country (i.e. fit stops at the time indicated on x-axis).cases, one can see a hint of a convergence. Parameter b 1 first oscillates and then decreases and at later time it tends to converge for Italy and France towards a value in the interval of 0.3 \u2212 0.35. Parameter b 2 typically starts at zero which indicates the purely exponential spread of the disease at the beginning when no measures are taken. At later times, b 2 tends to certain negative values. The study of correlations among parameters shows that the correlations are very high and the correlation coefficient may achieve values greater than 0.95 for certain times.",
