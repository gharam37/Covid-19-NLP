Influenza as a respiratory tract infection disease as COVID-19 might also be controlled. To assess the effects, we used the total passenger numbers sent in mainland China from 2018 to 2020 and the daily number of railway passenger (DNRP) flow in 2020 during Spring Festival travel rush to reflect the population movement and further to analyze newly and cumulative confirmed COVID-19 and influenza.

According to the . et al. reported that restrictions on Wuhan city closure and international population movement had an impact on the spread of COVID-19 between China and other countries 9 . In fact, a series of prevention and control measures, such as controlling domestic population flow, have significantly inhibited the prevalence of COVID-19 in mainland China, along with the restrictions on the closure of Wuhan and the international population flow. After first-level response starting point (23 January), COVID-19 new cases in China had a slowly rise, then from 3 February, COVID-19 new cases outside Wuhan had been dropping. From 17 February, new cases of mainland China also began to keep falling. On 7 March, new cases were less than 100 in mainland China, and only 5 in Wuhan. The actual cumulative number of COVID -19 cases (excluding Wuhan) after 23 January was smaller than the epidemic curve of Wuhan without closure predicted by Chinazzi M. et al, and the difference was gradually significant with time 10 . Based on the modeling and analysis of 15 top research institutions in the world, Wuhan travel ban, as the largest isolation event in human history, combined with the first-level prevention and control measures, had reduced the number of Chinese patients with COVID-19 by more than 700,000 according the report of Tian et al 10 . Zhang YP's study11 also showed that these measures may be conducive to control the epidemic. Therefore, we believe that prevention and control measures for the epidemic, including population movement restrictions, have played a significant role in the control of COVID-19.",

            "text": "just like COVID-19, is also a respiratory infection disease. Data released by the influenza surveillance network laboratory in mainland China showed that A week before and after the first-level response, the influenza positive rate dropped from 40.4% to 35.8%, and at the last week of February, the influenza positive rate fell to 2.1%. And compared with 2018 and 2019, the influenza season was shortened in 2020. Although after reaching the peak in 2020, there has been a downward trend, the influenza epidemic trend in the United States, France and Italy were similar to previous years (Extended DataFig. 1). As we know, the COVID-19 outbreak can be characterized as a \"pandemic\" as the virus spreads increasingly worldwide. China first-level response had strongly curbed the prevalence of COVID-19 in two months.It suggests the shorten influenza season in China might be related with the first-level response.It is estimated that influenza could cause 3-5 million cases with severe respiratory infection-related illness and 0.29-0.65 million deaths worldwide annual year (SupplementaryTable 2). Overall the mortality associated with influenza in China for adults aged 60 years or older were 38.5 per 100,000 person-seasonal, and for individuals younger under 60 years was 1.5 per 100,000 person-seasonal through 2010 to 2015 12 . According to the research of John Paget, overall rate of influenza-associated excess respiratory deaths for adults aged 65 years or older was 53.7 per 100,000 person-seasonal, while the mortality for individuals younger was 2.1 per 100,000 person-seasonal through 2002 to 201213 . The annual health economic burden associated with influenza should not be ignored[13][14][15] . The direct medical cost of patient cases of influenza is 156-595 RMB/person, and the indirect cost is 198-366 RMB/person. The economic burden of in-patient cases was about 10 times that of out-patient cases in China16 . The estimated losses in 2015 will be about US $500 billion (US dollars) per year, and the economic losses caused by influenza will vary (0.3%-1.6%) due to differences in national economic conditions, accounting for about 0.6% of global income13,14 . Therefore, the first-level responses not only prevent the spread of influenza, but also reduce the health economic burden caused by influenza that regularly occurs every year.The first-level response also included the other measures, such as wearing face masks, washing hands and other good respiratory hygiene habits, avoid crowd gathering, symptoms or contact history of home isolation observation. As we know, hand hygiene is commended in most national pandemic plans17  , and has been proven to prevent many infectious diseases. The face masks were common sight during the influenza epidemic period, but the role in preventing influenza virus transmission remains questionable18 . Recently, Leung NHL et al's research indicates that surgical face masks could prevent transmission of COVID-19 and influenza virus from symptomatic individuals 19 . Whether these measures play an important role in controlling COVID-19 and influenza need further research. In summary, the first-level response had been observed effectively in controlling both COVID-19 and influenza epidemic. At present, COVID-19 has become the global pandemic situation 20 . Our study suggests if other countries adopt Chinese-style COVID-19 control policy, they would not only reduce the health and economic by COVID-19, but also reduce health and economic burden caused by other respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza. Therefore, when other countries issue measures on COVID-19, they should consider what they might also benefit from decreasing the influenza burden and other respiratory infectious disease by adopting more aggressive epidemic prevention and control strategies, just like China-style. Online Methods Collection of population flow data To assess the first-level response for the prevention and control measures on the epidemic, we used the total passenger numbers sent in mainland China from 2018 to 2010 and the DNRP flow in 2020 during Spring Festival travel rush to reflect the population movement. The total number of passengers sent by railway, highway, waterway and civil aviation during the Spring Festival 2018 to 2020, and the daily number of passengers sent by railway during the Spring Festival 2020 obtained through the website of the Ministry of transport of China 21 . Surveillance of COVID -19 data in China except Hubei province In order to prevent and control COVID-19 in China, the NHC organized and updated the national diagnosis and treatment plan for COVID-19 timely.
