An exponential increase in demand has resulted in a shortage of numerous reagents in particular those associated with the lysis buffer required to extract the viral RNA. Herein, we describe a rapid collective effort by hospital laboratory scientists, academic researchers and the biopharma industry to generate a validated lysis buffer. We have formulated a 4M Guanidinium thiocyanate (GITC)/ Triton X-100 Lysis buffer which provides comparable results with the recommended reagents. This buffer will ease the burden on hospital labs in their heroic efforts to diagnose a large population of patients.",

Ultimately, they formulated a lysis buffer, which uses much less guanidinium thiocyanate than standard formulations appear to use (4 M compared to 6 M). Simultaneously, scientists at Teagasc, Fermoy were working on a different experimental formulation for lysis buffer (Boom et al., 1990) . Four laboratory preparations in total were tested for efficacy by medical scientists based in the Clinical Microbiology Department at Cork University Hospital (CUH), who conducted validation experiments using positive and negative samples. After validation, pharma-based scientists, generously prepared a large volume of the much needed 4 M GITC lysis buffer for distribution by CUH. ",
