It focuses on systems based medical education to improve the performance of health systems by adapting core professional competencies to specific contexts, while drawing on global knowledge. With the rapid development of medical science, the traditional teaching methods featuring slow knowledge updating and low teaching efficiency, to some extent, are unable to fully meet the diverse learning needs of medical students. Since blended learning was proposed in 2003, it has become one of the mainstream educational approaches in the medical educational reform [7] . Blended learning is a style of education in which students learn via electronic and online media as well as traditional face-to-face teaching, which places an emphasis on empowering students with the skills and knowledge required to make the most of the online material and independent study time, guiding students toward the most meaningful experience possible [8] . E-learning is based on network support. 5G is the abbreviation of the fifth-generation mobile communication technology. 5G network features enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) coping with the significant increase of data volumes, overall data capacity, and user density, massive machine type communications (mMTC) requiring low power consumption for a huge number of connected devices, ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) providing safety-critical and mission critical applications.

Team-based learning (TBL) is a structured form of small-group learning that emphasizes student preparation out of class and application of knowledge in class. In accordance with boosting medical educational reform by new technologies, we had tried to apply a new blended teaching model based on 5G network that combined TBL and online interaction to 50 fourth-year medical students who were receiving the \"5+3\" pattern courses regarding internal medicine in July, 2019 before the outbreak of COVID-19. They were organized strategically into 5 teams of 10 students that work together throughout the online class in this model. The pandemic was later determined to be PHEIC seriously endangering international public health, which posed great challenges to medical education. Medical universities in China closed campuses and shifted to other forms of distance learning such as massive open online courses (MOOCs), recorded teaching video in Rain Classroom, chatting via QQ in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Home-based learning allows students to extend their education from school to home, from offline to online, from passive learning to active learning. It seems to be an alternative learning approach under PHEIC that conform to the trend of the third-generation educational reform.

The result of the questionnaire show that students respond well to online education and have high enthusiasm, especially female medical students who have higher expectations for online courses. The 5G network can present high-definition image quality, improve voice clarity, and make real-time interaction more appealing. However, in terms of observation indicators concerning the evaluation of competence-oriented capacity, most medical students are more inclined to use the blended teaching model based on 5G network that combined TBL and online interaction. That indicates online learning based on 5G network can better improve students' enthusiasm and sense of participation. We can try to diversify the form of online education to enhance the students' learning experience. In particular, the model of flipped classroom can be adopted. Students in this model are encouraged to study independently through high-quality MOOCs and literature before class, and TBL can be carried out on social platforms such as online WeChat group or QQ group to cultivate students' teamwork spirit. After that, teachers summarize the class by integrating knowledge of medical humanity, public health and social economics to improve students' professionalism and analyzing the problems or questions raised by the students in the form of online live broadcast supported by 5G network to achieve a good learning experience.",

Amid current pandemic, the administrative department of higher medical education and school administrators should take actions based on a long-term perspective, systematic thinking and top-level design. Teachers are the main body of the action of \"keep medical schools running without suspending classes\". On the one hand,teachers have to change their ideas to form a \"student-centered\" teaching concept. On the other hand, teachers ought to improve their information literacy, familiarize themselves with online education, and master the method of online teaching. In addition to teaching basic professional knowledge, ideological and political concept, benevolence to patients, contribution to society, as well as the preventive medicine should be integrated into online courses. Moreover, it is necessary to raise medical students awareness of PHEIC during the pandemic, especially teach them about precautionary and preventive measures such as clinical diagnosis and treatment, isolation of patients and self-protection so that they can be competent in the future to handle public health emergencies and give medical guidance to the masses.",
