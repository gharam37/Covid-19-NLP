            "text": "Over the past several decades, multiple coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged as highly infectious, lethal viruses in humans, most notably in the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. To date, there are no known therapeutic or preventative agents to target CoVs. Though age and comorbidities severely increase case fatality rates, the host factors that influence resistance or susceptibility to infection with highly pathogenic human CoVs are unknown. Innate immune responses to CoVs are initiated by recognition of double-stranded (ds) RNA and induction of interferon, which turns on a gene expression program that inhibits viral replication. SARS-CoV-2 conserves an ADP-ribosylhydrolase domain previously shown to counteract innate immunity to both mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a model CoV, and SARS-CoV. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection of cell lines, infected ferrets, and a deceased patient's lung consistently and strikingly dysregulates the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) gene set with respect to NAD + synthesis and utilization. SARS-CoV-2 induces a set of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family members; these PARPs include enzymes required for the innate immune response to MHV. Further, we show that MHV infection induces an attack on host cell nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP + ). The data indicate that overexpression of a virally induced PARP, PARP10, is sufficient to depress host cell NAD metabolism and that NAD + boosting strategies differ in their efficacy to restore PARP10 function.",

The causative agent, severe acquired respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, is transmitted largely by lipid droplets that infect cells of the lung epithelium (Wu, Wu, Liu, & Yang, 2020) . Like other positive strand RNA genome CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 replication proceeds through formation of double-stranded (ds) RNA , which elicits an interferon (IFN) response (Kindler, Thiel, & Weber, 2016; Totura & Baric, 2012) . A component of innate immunity that is expressed broadly and does not depend on professional cells of the acquired immune system, IFN-driven gene expression elicits responses that have largely evolved to arrest protein synthesis and other aspects of host metabolism on which the virus depends (Schoggins & Rice, 2011) . Specifically, CoV genomes do not encode enzymes needed for fuel oxidation, ATP generation, nucleotide, amino acid, lipid or protein synthesis, and therefore depend on exploitation of host functions to synthesize and assemble more viruses Zhu et al., 2020) . Accordingly, viral replication and host cell homeostasis both depend on the four nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) coenzymes, NAD + , NADH, NADP + and NADPH, which are the central catalysts of metabolism (Belenky, Bogan, & Brenner, 2007) . These coenzymes accept and donate electrons in essential, ubiquitous processes of fuel oxidation, biosynthesis, and the generation and detoxification of reactive oxygen species.",

We showed that MHV infection strongly induces expression of PARP7, PARP9, PARP10, PARP11, PARP12, PARP13, and PARP14 (Grunewald et al., 2019) . To determine whether these gene expression changes are incidental to MHV infection, facilitate MHV infection, or are part of an innate immune response against MHV, we treated cells with siRNAs to knock down expression of these gene and then analyzed the impact on MHV replication. Our data showed that PARP7 plays a role in facilitating replication. In contrast, PARP14 is required for full induction of IFN-b expression (Grunewald et al., 2019; Grunewald, Shaban, Mackin, Fehr, & Perlman, 2020) , suggesting PARP14 is directly involved in establishing the innate immune response in CoV infected cells.",

Thus, CARH reverses the modification that is installed by the IFN-induced activities of MARylating PARP family members (Fehr et al., 2016) . CARH activity is required for virulence in vivo using mouse models of both MHV and SARS-CoV (Eriksson, Cervantes-Barragan, Ludewig, & Thiel, 2008; Fehr et al., 2016) . Moreover, an active site mutation that ablates the ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity of CARH resulted in a virus that replicates poorly in primary bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) (Grunewald et al., 2019) . We further identified PARP12 and PARP14 as CoVinduced ISGs that are required for the depressed replication of CARH mutant viruses, indicating that their activity is opposed by CARH-mediated reversal of ADPribosylation (Grunewald et al., 2019) .",

We also show that MHV infection results in a significant depression of key cellular NAD metabolites and that PARP overexpression is sufficient to depress NAD metabolism in a manner that resembles MHV infection. Whereas multiple approaches exist to restore NAD, we show that NAMPT activation but not PARP1,2 inhibition supports increased PARP10 enzymatic activity.

As shown in Figure 2 , infection led to a significant > 3-fold depression of cellular NAD + and NADP + with respect to control cells at 12 hours after a mock infection. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.047480 doi: bioRxiv preprint It is well known that PARP1 activation by DNA damage greatly increases its catalytic activity, leading to depression of cellular NAD + and ATP (Cohen, 2020; Gupte, Liu, & Kraus, 2017) . It is less clear whether transcriptional induction of the MARylating enzymes such as PARP10-that are induced substantially by viruses-might disturb cellular NAD + . To address, this, we overexpressed PARP10 in HEK 293T cells and measured changes in NAD metabolites using LC-MS/MS. We found that overexpression of GFP-PARP10 significantly depressed NAD + compared to overexpression of GFP alone (Figure 3) . We next determined if the PARP10mediated loss in NAD + could be restored by boosting NAD + levels, either by increasing synthesis or decreasing consumption. To increase NAD + synthesis we treated cells with SBI-797812 (Gardell et al., 2019) , a small molecule allosteric activator of NAMPT, which promotes NAM salvage. To decrease NAD + consumption, we treated cells with veliparib (Donawho et al., 2007) , a selective inhibitor of PARP1 Figure 3 . PARP10 overexpression is sufficient to reduce cellular NAD + levels and this can be overcome pharmacologically. HEK 293T cells were grown with the indicated expression plasmids for GFP or PARP10 and treated with small molecules to inhibit NAMPT (200 nM FK866), activate NAMPT (10 \u00b5M SBI-797812) or inhibit PARP1 and PARP2 (300 nM Veliparib). Normalized data show that cellular NAD + is substantively depressed by PARP10 expression and that stimulating biosynthetic activity by NAMPT activation or inhibiting NAD + consuming activity with PARP1,2 inhibition can overcome the PARP10-mediated depression of NAD + levels. n = 2 for each sample. Error bars represent SEM, p-values are from t test. See also Supplementary Information 8.

We found that both NAMPT activation and PARP1/PARP2 inhibition restored cellular NAD + under these conditions.",
