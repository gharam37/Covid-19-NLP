The Bacille Calmette Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine has previously been shown to have non-specific protective effects on infections, as well as longterm efficacy against tuberculosis. Using publicly available data we built a simple log-linear regression model to assess the association of BCG use and COVID-19-attributable mortality per 1 million population after adjusting for confounders including country economic status (GDP per capita), and proportion of elderly among the population. The timing of country entry into the pandemic epidemiological trajectory was aligned by plotting time since the 100 th reported case. Countries with economies classified as lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income and highincome countries (LMIC, UMIC, HIC) had median crude COVID-19 log-mortality of 0.4 (Interquartile Range (IQR) 0.1, 0.4), 0.7 (IQR 0.2, 2.2) and 5.5 (IQR 1.6, 13.9), respectively. COVID-19-attributable mortality among BCG-using countries was 5.8 times lower [95% CI 1.8-19.0] than in non BCG-using countries. Notwithstanding limitations due to testing constraints in LMICs, case ascertainment bias and a plausible rise of cases as countries progress along the epidemiological trajectory, these analyses provide intriguing observations that urgently warrant mobilization of resources for prospective randomized interventional studies and institution of systematic disease surveillance, particularly in LMICs.",

Early reports from Hubei province in China reported a case fatality rate (CFR) of 15% 1 , which with widening surveillance, rapidly decreased to below 3% 2,3 . As new epidemics began in other countries, early testing strategies focused only on severe cases or contacts of known cases and those with known international travel, leading to positively biased CFR estimates. A high CFR of 7.2% reported in Italy was attributed to a greater proportion of the elderly in the population and a stringent testing strategy restricted to severe disease cases 4 . With concurrent outbreaks occurring globally, marked discrepancies in CFR became increasingly apparent. In east Asian countries (Vietnam, Thailand, and Philippines), early rises in case incidence have not been followed by similarly sharp CFR increases. CFR estimation is sensitive to testing strategies, initiation of distancing measures, access to healthcare and population age structure. We surmised that since susceptibility to COVID-19 infection extends to the entire population, crude national COVID-19-specific mortality within the country-specific population would be an informative outcome indicator to study differences in mortality patterns amongst countries, in addition to a priori defined potential exposure variables including BCG vaccine use in national immunization schedules.",

It is given in infancy for prevention of severe forms of tuberculosis. Epidemiological and randomized trial evidence suggest a protective effect of BCG on infant mortality via nonspecific heterologous protection against other infections 5 possibly through innate immune epigenetic mechanisms 6, 7 . BCG lowers experimental viremia in adult human volunteers through upregulation of interleukins such as IL-1\u03b2 8 . In a randomized placebo-controlled trial in Indonesia, BCG given monthly consecutively for 3 months significantly reduced incidence of acute upper respiratory infections among individuals aged >65years 9 . In a trial among Native Americans, BCG vaccination given during childhood showed efficacy in preventing tuberculosis up to 60 years after vaccination, indicating the durability of its protection 10 . Demonstration that exposure to BCG vaccination can ameliorate severe COVID-19 disease and lower mortality could rationalize a therapeutic or preventive strategy that can have immediately deployable global impact. Therefore, using existing publicly available data we examined at the ecological level whether country-level COVID-19 mortality was associated with BCG use in national immunization schedules.",

Population and economic data from 2018 (gross domestic product (GDP), and high, middle or low-income status) were derived from the World Bank Population Data and Open Data repository 13 . In order to mitigate the bias centered around the differential epidemic time curves experienced by the different countries, we calculated days from the 100 th COVID-19-positive case to align the countries on a more comparable time curve.

The Shapiro-Wilk normality test confirmed that the log-transformed COVID-19-specific mortality was normally distributed. As China, a BCG-using country with a large population and a relatively concentrated death count in a single province can conceivably demonstrate an artifically lowered mortality and skew these results towards BCG use, we did a sensitivity analysis by running our model with the same covariate adjustments but without China. All data were analysed using the R environment for statistical computing (R Core Team 2018) 15 .",

Among observed COVID-19-attributable risk factors for disease severity and death, age over 65 years has been identified as a significant factor 4,18 , while it is inferred that LMICs which typically have a younger population structure would potentially experience fewer overall deaths. Another potential confounder was the time lag in deaths following detection of cases. We selected countries with at least 100 reported cases and adjusted for time since this sentinel event. After adjusting for country economic status, proportion of older population and aligning the epidemic trajectories of the highest hit countries, the intriguing observation of a significant association between BCG use and lower COVID-19-attributable mortality remained discernable.",

Ongoing containment measures are critical for infection transmission mitigation. These measures should be balanced against predicted increases in non-COVID-19 mortality arising directly from economic shutdowns and distancing measures. Severe trade restrictions and lowered productivity can increase poverty and food insecurity globally 30 . Major and prolonged disruptions in crucial health service delivery such as immunization programs or access to emergency obstetric and newborn care can result in a direct increase in preventable deaths, as occurred during and after ebolavirus epidemics 31 . Balancing transmission mitigation against sustaining basic health and nutrition access is a difficult but urgent task.",

Health system preparedness of each country and the institution of control measures such as social distancing and lockdowns can also determine the cases and mortality numbers.

By far the most important source of unmeasured confounding in our analysis relates to differential testing and reporting. Limited laboratory surveillance availability and access to facility-based care is common in countries using BCG. Substantial case underascertainment or under-reporting of deaths can magnify any association between mortality and BCG use. In exponential functions, small iterations in time result in substantial changes in outcome. Our findings need to be interpreted with caution; given vulnerable health systems and high levels of comorbidities in LMICs, if an exponential rise of cases followed by deaths were to occur in ensuing weeks, this would alter the epidemiological predictions in this report.",
