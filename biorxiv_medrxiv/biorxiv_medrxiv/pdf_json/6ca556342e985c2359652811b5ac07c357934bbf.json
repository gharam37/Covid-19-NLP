            "text": "The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in China has spread around the world, infecting millions and causing governments to implement strict policies to counteract the spread of the disease. One of the most effective strategies in reducing the severity of the pandemic is social distancing, where members of the population systematically reduce their interactions with others to limit the transmission rate of the virus. However, the implementation of social distancing can be difficult and costly, making it imperative that both policy makers and the citizenry understand the potential benefits if done correctly and the risks if not. In this work, a mathematical model is developed to study the effects of social distancing on the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Canada. The model is based upon a standard epidemiological SEIRD model that has been stratified to directly incorporate the proportion of individuals who are following social distancing protocols. The model parameters characterizing the disease are estimated from current epidemiological data on COVID-19 using machine learning techniques. The results of the model show that social distancing policies in Canada have already saved thousands of lives and that the prolonged adherence to social distancing guidelines could save thousands more. Importantly, our model indicates that social distancing can significantly delay the onset of infection peaks, allowing more time for the production of a vaccine or additional medical resources. Furthermore, our results stress the importance of easing social distancing restrictions gradually, rather than all at once, in order to prevent a second wave of infections. Model results are compared to the current capacity of the Canadian healthcare system by examining the current and future number of ventilators available for use, emphasizing the need for the increased production of additional medical resources.",

By January 20, 2020, the number of infections in China had sharply risen to 278, including six deaths, and several cases had also been confirmed in Japan, South Korea and Thailand [1] .

The virus is now affecting people in 210 countries and territories around the globe. To attenuate the spread of the virus and mitigate the impact on the medical system, several different social distancing strategies have been implemented in countries around the world. These strategies range from quarantining infected individuals and those returning from international travel, to orders to avoid public parks and facilities, to prohibiting gatherings of more than two people (with exceptions for family members). In South Korea, for instance, a recent report has indicated that social distancing protocols were responsible for reducing the effective R 0 value in various cities (below 1 in some cases) by estimating social distancing effects via traffic or metro data [5] . In addition, in some countries, all day cares, educational facilities, and non-essential businesses have been ordered temporarily closed by government officials, and citizens have been ordered to stay home, except to go shopping for essential supplies, such as groceries and prescriptions.",

These fits provided insight into the biologically and socially-relevant parameter ranges for the model. Next, we sampled these parameter ranges to simulate the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread in provinces within Canada using the Distancing-SEIRD model developed in this work.

However, once someone enters the exposed compartment, they will irreversibly progress through the infected compartment before ending as either recovered or deceased. The second model we consider is a proposed model of social distancing combined with SEIRD dynamics (details in the Supplementary Information, Section A) as illustrated in Figure 2 . This model is an extension of the SEIRD model described above which we refer to as the Distancing-SEIRD model. To incorporate social distancing, we further split the susceptible, exposed, and infected compartments into two types: distancers and mixers. Distancers represent people who are following social distancing protocols. As a result, susceptible distancers have less contact with infectious individuals and are less likely to become sick themselves. Furthermore, infectious distancers are less likely to pass the virus on to someone else as a result of their lower contact rate. Conversely, mixers are more likely to contract and spread the infection as a result of their increased motility.",

This would happen as the result of health care practitioners being unable to provide care for all serious patients due to the sheer volume of cases. As a result, even with effective triage procedures, we would anticipate more fatalities from COVID-19 in an overburdened healthcare system than in one with extra resources, even when the total case count is constant over a period.

First, we depict the short-term and longer-term fits to the country-wide data for Canada and China, as well as the fits to COVID-19 epidemiological data from Quebec and Ontario. We use the parameter fits to inform the Distancing-SEIRD model to ultimately make long-term predictions about the impact of social distancing strategies on the dynamics of the pandemic in Quebec and Ontario. The fits to the epidemiological data for China and Canada, obtained with the standard SEIRD model, are depicted in Figure 3 . The full fitting process is described in the Supplementary Information Section B.2. The process involves estimating key parameters from the raw epidemiological data and using machine learning techniques to optimize the remaining parameters. Figure 3 illustrates that the SEIRD model captured the overall trends in the number of infected individuals, the total number of deaths, and the number of recovered individuals. Importantly, with a suitable and realistic choice of parameters, the model captured the peak and the tail of the longer-term temporal data from China. Note that while the data fits for the infected curve for Canada (Figure 3 b) show quantitative disagreement, the qualitative dynamics of the curve are captured. Importantly, the deceased and recovered curves fit the data quite well. As discussed in Section 2, in the early dynamics of the epidemic at the national or provincial level the epidemic does not evolve as a single outbreak, but rather as the sum of multiple outbreaks in multiple cities with temporal delay. As a result, a model like Eq. (A.1) ought not to perfectly fit these early dynamics. In fact, if we did not set some of the parameters with epidemiological insights (as described in the Supplementary Information Section B.2) we could achieve stricter quantitative fits of the early dynamics of the epidemic at the cost of long term prediction. Parameter values for the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario are provided in Table 1 .",

Mathematically, this involved first stratifying the susceptible, exposed, and infected compartments of the SEIRD model, Eq. (A.1), based on social distancing behaviour.

For consistency and simplicity, in the Distancing-SEIRD model, the adherence to social distancing among the population was assumed to have begun on the date of provincial declaration of a state of emergency -March 17, 2020 for Ontario and March 27, 2020 for Quebec.

Unfortunately, Quebec has experienced higher numbers of COVID-19 cases, indicating that the progression of the pandemic is further along than in Ontario. Consistently, the Distancing-SEIRD model predicted that social distancing measures will lead to a less drastic reduction in deaths compared to Ontario. Despite this reduction, the importance of social distancing measures is still evident in Quebec: the simulations indicated that strict social distancing measures could lead to nearly 30,000 less deaths over a six-month span, compared to no social distancing. Studies attempting to estimate the level of adherence to social distancing policies have reported that approximately 60% of people are practicing social distancing in Ontario and 70% in Quebec [6] . Our Distancing-SEIRD model indicates that if social distancing continues at these levels for a six month period (until mid-September) the combined amount of lives saved in Ontario and Quebec alone is approximately 90,000.",

The results indicate that after two years, the total death count is approximately equal for all social distancing behaviours.

Obviously, various factors influence such a decision as many people face significant economic, social, and personal hurdles as social distancing is prolonged. The risk of ending social distancing too early is that the pandemic may reach a second peak, again overwhelming the healthcare system and leading to unnecessary deaths. A relevant problem therefore, is to determine the earliest time such that social distancing can be responsibly ended. One way to assess control of the virus is to limit the maximum number of concurrent infections to within the capacity of what the healthcare system can handle. A key limited medical resources in treatment of COVID-19 is mechanical ventilators and unfortunately, Canada, as well as most countries, are unlikely to have enough ventilators in order to meet the demand that the pandemic peak will necessitate. Currently, Ontario and Quebec have an estimated 1810 and 2970 ventilators, respectively [9] . In China, an estimated 20% of COVID-19 patients were hospitalized with 6.1% experiencing severe respiratory failure [10] . This can be used in the SEIRD model for the approximate proportion of COVID-19 patients who require the use of a mechanical ventilator, yielding an estimate of the anticipated ventilator demand at the peak of the pandemic by scaling the predicted infection curve.",

In Ontario, a 20% social distancing adherence reduces the size and slightly delays the onset of the initial wave of ventilator demand. For 40% social distancing, the initial wave is further reduced and delayed, but the effect of choosing the proper stop time is clear. Ending social distancing after three months creates a second wave approximately one month later, whereas extending social distancing for six months delays the second wave until the winter, allowing time for the production of additional ventilators in time to meet the demand. For high proportions of social distancing, the main effect becomes delaying the curve, rather than flattening it. Indeed, for 80% social distancing, the ventilator demand curve is nearly identical to the case with no social distancing except for a time-shift until after social distancing has ended.

In both Quebec and Ontario, the peak number of simultaneous infections decreases as the proportion of social distancers increases. In Quebec, after approximately one month of social distancing, the peak infections reaches a constant value and further social distancing simply delays the onset of the second peak, rather than reducing its size (as can be seen in Figure 5 . This is largely because Quebec is further into the pandemic than Ontario, so the size of its first peak cannot be reduced to smaller than its subsequent peaks. In Ontario, the social distancing stop time has a significant impact on the maximum peak infection number. Specifically, for low proportions of social distancing (20% and 40%), the behaviour of the maximum peak behaves much like Quebec; however, for high proportions of social distancing (60% and 80%), the behaviour is qualitatively much different. For 60%, the maximum peak decreases as the length of social distancing increases until it levels-off at approximately six months. For 80%, the maximum peak slowly decreases until levelling-off after approximately 15 months. This is because at 80% social distancing, the main effect is delaying the peak, rather than shrinking it.

Fortunately, the increased need for ventilators has been recognized by government officials and the Canadian government has announced the production of 30,000 new ventilators to combat the pandemic. Assuming these ventilators are divided among the provinces proportionally based on population, we can assess whether this number is sufficient to handle the anticipated demand.

The main objective in social distancing is to flatten the infection curve, preventing the healthcare system from becoming over-burdened, and minimizing the need for triage. The flatter the pandemic infection curve, the lesser the need for triage, and therefore the more lives that will be saved. Furthermore, social distancing acts not only to reduce the peak infections, but also to delay it -buying time for the increased production of medical resources, testing of pharmaceutical therapies, and the development of a vaccine. Our results also stress the importance of gradually relieving social distancing rather than all at once. A significant decrease in social distancing at once can result in a second wave of infections which can overwhelm the healthcare system.",

It is determined by the probability of disease transmission as well as the chance of contact, thus it indirectly incorporates the basic reproduction number, R 0 , of the virus and the proportion of individuals who are social distancing. The mean latent period, which is the average length of time between exposure to the virus and the point at which an individual becomes contagious, is given by \u03b3 \u22121 . The rate at which infectious individuals are removed from the disease (either via recovery or death) is given by (\u03b1 + \u03b4), thus the value of (\u03b1 + \u03b4) \u22121 is the mean length of time an infected individual is contagious before they either recover or die from the disease. The five compartments are subjected to the constraint S + E + I + R + D = N , where N is the total population. We point out that the state equations are considered to represent direct counts of the population size in this work, rather than proportions of the population.

Specifically, \u03b2 DD , controls the rate of transmission from infected distancers to susceptible distancers, \u03b2 DM from infected distancers to susceptible mixers, \u03b2 M D from infected mixers to susceptible distancers, and \u03b2 M M from infected mixers to susceptible mixers. Intuitively, individuals who practice social distancing are less likely to come into contact with others and transmit the virus. Thus we assume that \u03b2 DD < \u03b2 DM = \u03b2 M D < \u03b2 M M . These assumptions imply that individuals who practice social distancing are least likely to pass the disease to one another and that individuals who do not practice social distancing are most likely to pass the disease to one another. Furthermore, by assigning \u03b2 DM = \u03b2 M D , we are making the simplifying assumption that a susceptible distancer is equally likely to come into contact with an infectious mixer as a susceptible mixer is to come into contact with an infectious distancer. Moreover, we assume that this cross-compartment transmission rate falls between the two inter-compartment transmission rates. Similarly, while the pairs of parameters \u03b3 M and \u03b3 D , \u03b1 M and \u03b1 D , and \u03b4 M and \u03b4 D are theoretically different, we assume that each pair is the same across compartments. That is, we assume that \u03b3 M = \u03b3 D , \u03b1 M = \u03b1 D , and \u03b4 M = \u03b4 D and drop the subscripts. Effectively, we are assuming that the behaviour of social distancing has minimal effect on the values of these parameters. That is to say, we assume that the latent period \u03b3 \u22121 and the mean infectious length (\u03b1 + \u03b4) \u22121 are functions entirely of the disease and are not influenced by behaviour.",

Consequently a simplistic approach is implemented to model social distancing and disease transmission, and this simplistic approach is not completely accurate. The models used in this work do not included age, population density and distribution, environmental conditions, or asymptomatic individuals. Furthermore, both models consider only a single strain of the virus. Recent epidemiological data indicates that the ancestral strain of the virus comprises approximately 30% of cases, while a mutated form accounts for the remaining 70% of infections. Moreover, for simplicity, we have made the assumption that the proportion of individuals who are social distancing is a constant. In a future work, we will construct a more comprehensive model that addresses these limitations to improve the prediction accuracy of the model.",

We chose our range for \u03b3 \u22121 to be between 1.25 days and 10 days, in order to ensure that we capture the most likely parameter values.

The quality improvements of the fit after this final local optimization step are minor, indicating that differential evolution of the maximum likelihood estimator already achieves accurate parameter discovery. We numerically solve the differential equation system with the integrate.odeint function from SciPy that acts as a wrapper for lsoda [19, 20] .",

C.1 along with the heuristic assumption that \u03b2 DD = \u03b2 M M /100 and \u03b2 DM = \u03b2 M M /20. The assumption on \u03b2 DD is equivalent to assuming that distancing individuals are only 1% as likely to transmit the virus to one another as mixing individuals are. Likewise the assumption on \u03b2 DM is that the distancing and mixing individuals are only 5% as likely to transmit the virus to one another as mixing individuals are. These effects are simplifying assumptions and other ratios could have been chosen. An important piece to note is that \u03b2 DD = 0. We do not consider social distancing to be the same as complete isolation. This is meant to capture the fact that social distancers will still interact with the general public either by visiting the grocery store or the doctor or in some other reasonable exposure. With these ratios between the compartmental transmission rates, we can determine the final value of \u03b2 M M (and thus \u03b2 DD and \u03b2 DM as well) for a given \u03b8 by solving Eq. C.1.",

Now we discuss how this single, effective \u03b2 value relates to the three parameters \u03b2 DD , \u03b2 DM , and \u03b2 M M from the Distancing-SEIRD Model (Eq. (A.2)). In order to compare the exposed and infected compartments between the two models, define\u00ca = E D + E M and\u00ce = I D + I M . Hence,d dt\u00ca = \u03b2 DD N S D I D + \u03b2 DM N (S D I M + S M I D ) + \u03b2 DD N S M I M \u2212 \u03b3\u00ca d dt\u00ce = \u03b3\u00ca \u2212 \u03b4\u00ceThe Distancing-SEIRD Model has a disease-free equilibrium corresponding to S D = \u03b8 N , S M = (1 \u2212 \u03b8) N and I D = I M = E D = E M = R = 0. Consider linearizing Eq. (A.2) about this disease-free equilibrium. In the neighbourhood of this disease-free equilibrium note that S D and S M are effectively constant (up to a super-linear correction), hence, taking S D = \u03b8 N and S M = (1 \u2212 \u03b8) N d dt\u00ca = \u03b2 DD N \u03b8 N I D + \u03b2 DM N (\u03b8 N I M + (1 \u2212 \u03b8) N I D ) + \u03b2 DD N (1 \u2212 \u03b8) N I M \u2212 \u03b3\u00ca = \u03b2 DD \u03b8 I D + \u03b2 DM (\u03b8 I M + (1 \u2212 \u03b8) I D ) + \u03b2 DD (1 \u2212 \u03b8) I M \u2212 \u03b3\u00ca d dt\u00ce = \u03b3\u00ca \u2212 \u03b4\u00ce also note that in the neighbourhood of this equilibrium, I D = \u03b8\u00ce and I M = (1 \u2212 \u03b8)\u00ce (up to a super-linear correction), henced dt\u00ca = \u2212\u03b3\u00ca + \u03b2 DD \u03b8 2 + 2 \u03b2 DM \u03b8 (1 \u2212 \u03b8) + \u03b2 M M (1 \u2212 \u03b8) 2 \u00ce d dt\u00ce = \u03b3\u00ca \u2212 \u03b4\u00ce.Now comparing this with the linearization of the SEIRD Model in Section B.2, we find that the two systems are asymptotically equivalent under the change of variables \u03b2 = \u03b2 DD \u03b8 2 + 2 \u03b2 DM \u03b8 (1 \u2212 \u03b8) + \u03b2 M M (1 \u2212 \u03b8) 2 N .
