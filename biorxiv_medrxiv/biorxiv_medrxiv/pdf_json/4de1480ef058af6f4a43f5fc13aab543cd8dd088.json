As of March 31, 2020, the global pandemic lead to more 57 than 800,000 total confirmed cases and 40,000 deaths. Estimation of the rate of early epidemic 58 spread in Wuhan, China, lead to different conclusions. Initially, it was suggested that the 59 epidemic grew at 0\u00b71-0\u00b714/day, leading to an epidemic doubling time of 5-7 days 2-5 . However, 60 using domestic travel data and two distinct approaches, we estimated that the epidemic in Wuhan 61 grew much faster than initially estimated, and the growth rate is likely to be between 0\u00b721-62 0\u00b73/day, translating to a doubling time between 2\u00b73 to 3\u00b73 days, and an R0 approximately at 5\u00b77 63 with a large confidence interval 6 . A fast epidemic spread is consistent with multiple other lines of 64 evidence, such as the rapid increase of the epidemic curve by symptom onset published by China 65 CDC 7 and the growth in the number of death cases in Hubei, China during late January 2020 6 . 66",

Third, it is 73 important for accurate estimation of the basic reproductive number, R0, which in turn is used for 74 many control measures, including evaluation of the vaccine/herd immunity threshold needed to 75 stop transmission 6,8 . However, a major challenge to the inference of the growth of COVID-19 is 76 that as a result of a fast-growing outbreak and a sizable infected population with no or mild-to-77 moderate symptoms 9,10 , case confirmation data is influenced by many factors in addition to the 78 true epidemic growth, including substantial underreporting 11 , i.e. low detection rate, changes in 79 surveillance intensity and delays in case confirmation.

Based on this idea, we designed a simple 87 methodology to disentangle the epidemic growth from confounding factors, such as 88 underreporting, delays in case confirmation and changes in surveillance intensity. We fit models 89 to both case incidence data and death count data collected from eight European countries and the 90 US in March 2020. We show that in most countries, the detection rate of infected individuals is 91 in general low, and COVID-19 spreads very fast in these countries. For such a fast-epidemic 92 growth, our results suggest that very strong and active control measures need to be implemented 93 as early as possible regardless of the public health goal (e.g. mitigation versus containment), and 94 that moderate control measures will not achieve measurable public health benefit. 95 96",

First, to minimize the impact of stochasticity and uncertainty in early data 108 collection, we used case confirmation incidence data starting from the date when the cumulative 109 number of cases was greater than 100, and used daily new death count data starting from the date 110 when the cumulative death count is greater than 20 in each country. Second, to estimate the early 111 outbreak growth in each country before control measures were implemented and at the same time 112 maximize the power of inference, we allowed a maximum of 15 days of data points for the two 113 types of data, leading to a maximum of 30 data points for each country. Note that the end date of 114 incidence data used for inference is at or close to the date when strong control measures were 115 implemented in each country (Table S1 ). We tested the sensitivity of model predictions when 116 only 10, 13 days of data points are included for inference. The results are robust to this variation 117 (Table S1 ), suggesting that the choice of 15 days is reasonable and that the data shows consistent 118 exponential growth during this period. 119 120",

Previously, R0 for COVID-19 were estimated to be 268 between 2-3 2-5 and were widely reported in official documents 18 and public media. These 269 estimates are mostly based on an epidemic growth rate between 0\u00b71 and 0\u00b714/day 2-5 , which we 270 now know to be inconsistent with many new lines of evidence and data as discussed in this paper 271 and a previous work 6 . The growth rates that we estimated in this paper are simply not consistent 272 with a low R0. Previously we showed that with a mean serial interval, defined as the duration of 273 time between onset of symptoms in an index case and a secondary case, of 6-9 days 3,19 and an 274 epidemic growth rate between 0\u00b719-0\u00b729/day, the value of R0 must be higher than 3 6 . Using the 275 same framework as in Ref. 6, we find that when the growth rate is 0\u00b719/day, the median R0 is 276 .

Estimation of the exponential growth rate, doubling time of epidemics and 415 detection rate of infected individuals in 8 European countries and the US. Red and black 416 symbols show the daily counts of new case confirmation and new death, respectively. Dots 417 denote data used for parameter inference; whereas open circles denote data that are not used for 418 parameter inference. We simulated the exponential model using sampled parameter 419 combinations that are able to explain the data shown in dots (see the Uncertainty Quantification 420 section in the Supplementary Material). The colored bands denote the area between the lower 421 and upper bounds of simulated/predicted true daily infection incidence (blue), daily case 422 confirmation (red) and daily death (grey) assuming no intervention efforts nor changes in 423 surveillance intensity. Deviation of open circles from the corresponding bands thus indicates 424 either changes in surveillance intensity or impacts of control measures. 425 426 427 Figure 2.

Strong control measures are needed to achieve measurable benefits, no matter the 433 goal is mitigation ('flatten the curve') or containment. (A) Predicted time to epidemic peak 434 for different growth rates. To delay epidemic peak beyond 18 months, a growth rate less than 435 0\u00b7027/day is needed. This threshold is denoted by dashed lines. Red area shows the ranges of 436 growth rates estimated for the eight European countries, the US and Wuhan, China. (B) Final 437 fraction of infected individuals after 18 months. A growth rate less than 0\u00b7023/day (doubling 438 time more than 30 days) is needed to achieve the goal that less than 10% of individuals are 439 infected (dashed lines). However, the benefit, i.e. fraction of uninfected individuals, increases 440 exponentially when the growth rate is further reduced beyond the threshold. (C) Similar levels of 441 efforts, measured as fractions of transmission reduction, are needed to achieve containment, i.e. 442 reverting epidemic growth (dots), or mitigation, i.e. the final fraction of infected individuals is 1% 443 (x) or 10% (open circle). We assumed epidemic growth rates of 0\u00b719 (red) or 0\u00b729/day (blue).",
