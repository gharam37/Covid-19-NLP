To identify the key parameters or processes that have the greatest 28 effects on the pandemic and reveal the different progressions of epidemics in different 29 countries, we quantified enhanced control measures and the dynamics of the production 30 and provision of medical resources. We then nested these within a COVID-19 epidemic 31 transmission model, which is parameterized by multi-source data. We Using information such as the number of beds per thousand people in each country 83 and differences in increasing volumes of medical resources (closely related to medical 84 staff numbers) that can be provided by each country during public health emergencies 85 (9-14), we modeled the number of beds provided by each country during the 86 development of a COVID-19 epidemic with the logistic growth function using country-87 specific varying growth rates and carrying capacities (section SM1 of Supplementary 88 material (SM)). In order to represent the limitation of hospital beds we divided 89 confirmed cases into two groups in terms of severity of symptoms: non-hospitalized 90 The multiple data sources including the numbers of newly reported cases and the 97 cumulative numbers of reported deaths for all six countries were used to estimate the 98 unknown parameters and to fit the data (Figs.1 and S2, Table S2 ). The parameter values 99 associated with the intensity of disease transmission in each country are compared and 100 discussed in SM3. Like China, the epidemic in South Korea is almost stable, and their 101 respective effective reproduction numbers have, by mid-April 2020, both been less than 102 1 for six weeks ( Fig.1 (B, C) . The COVID-19 epidemic in Japan has been fluctuating 103 on a small scale with a lot of random fluctuations. However, since 25 March, the 104 epidemic has rebounded, the numbers of newly reported cases and deaths have 105 continued to increase (Figs.1(D) and S2(C)). The Italian and Spanish epidemics seem 106 to be about to peak and they are approaching their turning points, but their cumulative 107 death rates will continue to rise, and there is no sign of stabilization in the short term 108 (Figs.1(E, F) and S2(D, E)).

This is especially so for an increasing detection rate, which, 208 while increasing the number of confirmed cases in the short term, leads to declines in 209 the number of new infections. This is due to strict contact tracing followed by 210 quarantine and isolation, and consequently reductions in the number of confirmed cases 211 and deaths in the long term. Moreover, increasing the detection rate may result in runs 212 on medical resources, depending on their initial capacities. As illustrated in Fig.3 (C, E 213 and G) merely increasing detection rates in Italy or Spain did not induce runs on medical 214 resources but these did occur in Iran (red curves). Hence the synergistic effect of 215 improving medical capacity and production with enhancing detection is essential to 216 mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic as well as avoiding runs on medical resources. 217",

Nevertheless, improving the detection rate can effectively and rapidly 37 reduce the mortality rate, even after runs on medical resources. Combinations of 38 multiple prevention and control strategies and timely improvement of abilities to 39 supplement medical resources are key to effective control of the COVID-19 epidemic. 40 A 50% reduction in comprehensive control measures would have led to the cumulative 41 numbers of confirmed cases and deaths exceeding 590000 and 60000, respectively, by 42 27 March 2020 in mainland China. The proposed model can assist health authorities to 43 predict when they will be most in need of hospital beds and equipment such as 44 ventilators, personal protection equipment, drugs and staff. in limiting the spread of the virus and the growth of the epidemic (1-8). 60 This has been shown by the successes of China, South Korea and other countries in 61 curbing the spread of the virus and achieving important prevention and control results 62 (7, 8). For example, unprecedented restrictive measures, including travel restrictions, 63 contact tracing, quarantine and lock-down of entire towns/cities adopted by the Chinese 64 authorities has resulted in a significant reduction in the COVID-19 epidemic in 65 mainland China (7, 8). However, with the increase of COVID-19 cases in the world, 66 especially the sharp increase in the cumulative number of reported deaths, the shortage 67 of medical resources has become the most serious threat facing countries experiencing 68 serious epidemics. 69 Enhancing the detection rate can lead to early quarantine or isolation of latent and/or 70 infected individuals and then the numbers of confirmed cases (2, 5, 8) increase 71 significantly. A common problem faced by many countries is to what extent can 72 improvements to medical resources be synchronized with an increase of patient 73 numbers, in order to avoid runs on medical resources. How to quantify the levels of 74 improvements in prevention and control measures and of medical resources in order to 75 reveal differences in the epidemic's progression in different countries remain unclear, 76 but are addressed in this study. In order to investigate this issue, we propose a general 77 COVID-19 epidemic transmission dynamics model that includes limitations of medical 78 resources and enhancing prevention and control strategies in six selected countries 79 (China, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Spain and Iran) (7, 8). The formulated transmission 80 model is parameterized by multi-source data such as the numbers of newly reported 81 cases and the cumulative numbers of deaths for each country. 82",

Italy 132 and Spain have relatively low quarantine rates (red curves in Fig.2) while the other four 133 countries all have high contact tracing followed by quarantine. Japan's quarantine rate 134 remains at a high level so far. The relatively high detection rates, followed by strict 135 quarantine, are associated with quick control of the epidemic (as illustrated for China, 136 South Korea and Iran in Fig.2 (A, B, F)) while the epidemics in Italy and Spain with 137 low detection rates became worse (Fig.2 (D, E)). 138 Define ( ) = max{ ( ) \u2212 2 ( ) \u2212 1 ( ), 0} as the daily potential number of 139 beds available for the individuals currently quarantined at home.
