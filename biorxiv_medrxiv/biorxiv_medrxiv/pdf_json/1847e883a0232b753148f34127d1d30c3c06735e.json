Early investigations determined that this new disease was caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Due to the rapid transmission and spread of the disease, the WHO declared this outbreak a global pandemic on 31 st January 2020 (2) . Because of the wide spectrum of presentations, from asymptomatic and subclinical infections to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, many of which resemble other common respiratory infections, laboratory testing is essential for establishing the diagnosis of COVID-19. Once infected individuals are identified through laboratory testing, they can be isolated and managed appropriately, along with identification and quarantine of their contacts. The increased demand for laboratory testing has led to global shortages of all the required supplies, from personal protective equipment such as N95 masks, to swabs, and even the reagents required for viral RNA extraction.",

When these kits become scarce, many laboratories will have to turn to alternative methods, but often lack the expertise or the resource to test and validate those alternative methods. The underlying principle of modern, paramagnetic bead-based isolation of nucleic acids is their precipitation from solution by a molecular crowding reagent such as polethylenglycol (PEG) under high salt conditions. It was first described for DNA 45 years ago (1) and later adapted to the isolation of viral RNA from tissues (2) . Modern iterations of this procedure such as Ampure XP add carboxyl-coated paramagnetic beads to the PEG solution, thus greatly accelerating the precipitation as well as alleviating the need for time-consuming centrifugations, enabling automation of this process on liquid handling robots (3). This method is highly efficient in recovering even minute amounts of nucleic acids from larger volumes, such as shown in the precipitation of single-cell genomes (4, 5) .",

Until more experiments are done to fully understand the intricacies of this effect, we opted for a compromise between increased capture efficiency and consistency and a weak suppressive effect on the reverse transcription efficiency. When applying these conditions to 204 clinical samples, we only observed a 2.5% inhibition of the RT-qPCR, indicating that our method is suitable for large-scale use in testing laboratories.",

This method has a comparable sensitivity and specificity with commercially available reference assays, especially when considering that the reference method uses 220 \u00b5l of sample, whereas this method only uses 150 \u00b5l. This method can be performed manually, with a throughput of maximum 48 samples in 90 minutes. In order to increase throughput and reproducibility and reduce human error, it can be implemented on many laboratory liquid-handling robots. In our hands, we were able to process 96 samples in 60 minutes. We made 2 methods for a Hamilton STAR liquidhandling system available on GitHub, processing either 24 or 96 samples per run. Future versions will make use of on-deck parallelization and offer a throughput of at least 192 samples in 60 min.",

The beads were captured by incubating the plate for 8-10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the bead pellet washed twice with 300 \u00b5l of freshly prepared 80% ethanol. During the first wash, the pellet was resuspended and incubated on the magnet for 6 minutes. No mixing was performed during the second ethanol wash. The pellet was air-dried and the absence of ethanol visually confirmed. The RNA was eluted by adding 23 \u00b5l of RSB (Illumina) and transferring 20 \u00b5l of eluate to a fresh plate.",
