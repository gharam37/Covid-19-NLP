While levels of genomic variability between SARS-CoV-2 isolates are limited, to our knowledge, it is not clear whether the observed patterns of variability in viral super-clades reflect ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, or merely genetic drift and founder effects. Here, we analyze more than 1100 complete, high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and provide evidence for the absence of distinct evolutionary patterns/signatures in the genomes of the currently known major clades of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses suggest that the presence of distinct viral episomes at different geographic locations are consistent with founder effects, coupled with the rapid spread of this novel virus. We observe that while cross species adaptation of the virus is associated with hypervariability of specific protein coding regions (including the RDB domain of the spike protein), the more variable genomic regions between extant SARS-CoV-2 episomes correspond with the 3' and 5' UTRs, suggesting that at present viral protein coding genes should not be subjected to different adaptive evolutionary pressures in different viral strains. Although this study can not be conclusive, we believe that the evidence presented here is strongly consistent with the notion that the biased geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 isolates should not be associated with adaptive evolution of this novel pathogen.",

Although comparative analyses suggest that genomic variability between different isolates of SARS-CoV-2 is generally low (Lu et al, 2020 , Zhang e t al, 2020 , Tang et al, 2020 , the fact that distinct viral episomes show a highly biased geographic distribution is potentially alarming, as, at present, it is not completely clear whether frequent variants reflect the adaptive processes, which result in the emergence of novel, and potentially more virulent strains. Moreover at present it is unclear whether the genomic variability of major clades of SARS-CoV-2 and their biased geographic distribution, could explain -at least in part-apparent differing rates of lethality observed worldwide (Baud et al 2020) .",

Indeed, the major clades of SARS-CoV-2 are identified only by a limited number of clade-specific genetic variants and show very modest variability. Notably, variable sites are enriched in the 5' and 3' non coding regions of the genome, unlike genomic sites which are hyper-variable between closely related strains with distinct host specificites.",

Strikingly, the same pattern is not recovered when the SARS-CoV-2 genome is compared with genomic sequences of closely related viral specimens isolated from non-human hosts, suggesting a specific error/substitution pattern of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase. This observation is confirmed even when only polymorphic sites common between 2 or more genomes are considered. Intriguingly, analyses of the substitution patterns of the coronavirus associated with the 2003-2004 SARS outbreak (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004, Song et al 2005) do show a similar, but less marked tendency of increased C->T substitutions.

Consistent with these reduced levels of variability, we observe that the 3 Super-clades identified in this study are defined by only a limited number of genetic polymorphic sites. For example, as evident from Figure 1, Super-clade II is characterized by the presence of only 2 polymorphic sites, which are common and specific to all the isolates of this group (8702 C->T and 28144 C->T). Super-clade III is defined by the presence of only 4 clade-specific variants (241 C->T, 3037 C->T, 14408 C->T and 23403 D->G).

Similar analyses performed by comparing the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome with the genomes of SARS-CoV-2-like coronavirus with a different host specificity, show the presence of a distinct pattern of variation in SARS-CoV-2-like genomes that is likely the result of adaptive evolutionary pressures (Figure 3 D-E). Indeed, hyper-variable genomic regions (Adjusted Fisher test p-value \u22641e-10 and \u22641e-5 respectively for comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 like CoVs isolated from bats and pangolins) between these genomes clearly correspond with protein coding loci, and in particular with the RDB protein domain of the S1 subunit of the spike protein -the domain which mediates the recognition of the host ACE2 receptor (see the peak at around position 23000 in Figure 3 D-E). A similar pattern is recovered also when genomes of bat and pangolin SARS-CoV-2 like CoVs are compared (Figure 3 F).",

Output files were processed by the means of a custom Perl script, and incorporated in a phenetic matrix, with variable positions on the rows and viral isolates in the columns. For all the isolates considered in the study, values of 1 were used to indicate presence of a variant, values of 0 its absence. dN/dS rates were computed on aligned CDS sequences using the Ka/Ks calculator tool (Zang et al, 2006) allowing for the selection of the most appropriate substitution model, based on the Akaike information criterion. The GY (Goldman and Yang,1994) model resulted to be the preferred model in all the settings herein tested. Only proteins longer than 100 amino acid residues and with more than 50 polymorphic sites in the CDS, were considered in this analysis. For SARS-CoV-2 this was limited to nsp12, nsp3, nsp4 and the spike protein. Variability with respect to the reference NC_045512.2 SARS-CoV-2 assembly was computed on sliding windows of 100 bp, overlapped by 50 bp, by counting the proportion of variable genomic sites contained in each window (number of variable sites in the window, divided by the total number of variable sites), by using a custom Perl script. A Fisher-exact test, contrasting the local variability in a window with the average variability in the genome, was used to identify hypervariable regions.
