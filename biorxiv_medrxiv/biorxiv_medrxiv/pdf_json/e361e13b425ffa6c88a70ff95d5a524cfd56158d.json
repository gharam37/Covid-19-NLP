The ICU bed capacity in Turkey is expected to exceed 4.4-fold and non-ICU bed capacity exceed 3.21fold.

Compliance with NPIs makes a 94,303 difference in the expected number of deaths. In both scenarios, the predicted peak value of occupied ICU and non-ICU beds remains below the Turkey's capacity. While this study conducted, curfew for >65 and <20 age groups was in force in Turkey. If the curfew is declared for the 21-64 age population (4 th scenario), the R0 value drops below 1 (0.98), the expected deaths are 14,230 and the peak values of daily ICU and non-ICU bed demand are below the country's capacity.",

In the estimation of the actual number of cases, the case fatality rate (CFR) and IFR concepts are often confused. The CFR refers to the ratio of the number of deaths in a given time segment to diagnosed cases. However, this rate includes only those who are admitted to the hospital and who have been identified, not the proportion of real infected people in the community. If perfect conditions were observed and all patients could be followed, how many infected people would die is expressed by IFR. (15) . For this reason, it is more appropriate the use of IFR in the estimation of the final death numbers and the use of the CFR in the estimation of the death numbers in a time section. (16) . In a study conducted in 1334 cases in China, agespecific IFR rates were calculated. (15) . In the ICL report, these values were calibrated for the UK and US population. In this study, the rates in ICL report has also applied for the Turkey population.",

In this model, the time between compartments is the basis of all estimates. In SEIR-based studies, generally, asymptomatic and symptomatic cases were not differentiated according to the incubation time, infectivity time, and R0 variables. In this study, these two groups are included in the model separately. The proportion of asymptomatic cases can be up to 78% in the studies performed according to the symptoms of the day the PCR sample was taken. (33, 34) . However, WHO stated that 75% of cases that were asymptomatic developed symptoms later and asymptomatic proportion is very low and is not a major determinant of the pandemic. (35) . In the study conducted on the Diamond Princess ship, 17.9% of all cases were stated to be asymptomatic. (20) .

With the measures that Turkey has taken so far, the highest expected need for ICU beds is taken under the existing capacity and ICU bed capacity is not exceeded in case of realization of both scenarios.

In cases where vaccination is not possible and the non-immune population cannot be reduced, the only effective means of combating the pandemic is to keep the number of contact contacts under control. In our study, we estimate that the R0 values decreased to 1.38 as a result of existing measures in Turkey. This decreases the rate of spread and attack rate of the pandemic. However, in the case of no intervention the attack rate will be 88.1%, while in the case of a general curfew, this value will decrease to 0.7% and mortality rates decline from 0.54% to 0.02%. Complete control of the pandemic is possible by keeping R0 below 1. For this, additional measures are needed. As the economic and social burden of the interventions to be made to reduce the R0 value below 1 are very high, the solution with the highest costbenefit ratio is the development of a new vaccine molecule. These numbers will change if a new treatment or vaccine is developed throughout the year.",
