Furthermore, CXR can also be acquired with portable instrumentation in isolated rooms in emergency departments or at the patient's bedside in every other department, which would considerably ease the required sanitization process. CXR images have a high spatial resolution, but they are planar images, not allowing three-dimensional slicing as. Anyway, even for CXR the most common reported abnormal finding are GGOs, with portions of the lungs appearing as a \"hazy\" shades of grey instead of being black with fine white lung markings for blood vessels [9] . As GGOs are usually the first radiological sign of COVID-19 pneumonia, it could be hypothesized to be able to improve the early diagnosis of COVID-19 by means of a smarter reading of author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

Individuals with very mild disease may eventually have positive RT-PCR results but would have been missed by early CXR.

Second, the external validation set was only temporally separate but not geographically separate from the training one and also relatively small.

In 2018, a worldwide competition on the Kaggle portal (www.kaggle.com) was launched by the Radiological Society of North America on the complex task of automatically screening pneumonia (viral and bacterial) [10] versus non-pneumonia patients on CXRs. Many research groups participated and trained their AI algorithms on thousands of CXRs images with clinical diagnoses of viral or bacterial pneumonia and non-pneumonia made available from several US hospitals. Leader groups obtained excellent results training their different AI systems on CXRs [11].
