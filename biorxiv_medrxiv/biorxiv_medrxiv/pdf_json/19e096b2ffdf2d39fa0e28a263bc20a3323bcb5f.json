We dynamically measured those reported indicators in 132 cases of COVID-19 patients including the moderate-cured (moderated and cured), severe-cured (severe and cured) and critically ill (died). Our data showed that CRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM%, lactic acid and viral load could predict prognosis and guide classification of COVID-19 patients in different degrees. CRP, IL-6 and LYM% were more effective than other three factors in predicting prognosis. For disease classification, CRP and LYM% were sensitive in identifying the types between critically ill and severe (or moderate). Notably, among the investigated factors, LYM% was the only one that could distinguish between the severe and moderate types.",

This pandemic has been spreading worldwide rapidly since March 2020. It was reported that more than 500,000 individuals had been diagnosed and this disease caused over 20,000 deaths at late of March 2020. The rapidly increased cases lead to overload of public healthcare sources and a run on medical facilities [3] . The severity of patients with COVID-19 can be divided into 4 levels, i.e. mild, moderate, severe and critical according to the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis Program (5th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China [4] . Current experience reveals that most of infected people (approx. over 80%) are not severe and can get self-healing, only a small part of cases should be carefully treated and hospitalized [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, the mortality among the severe, especially the critical patients, is quite high, thus it is critical to screen out reliable predictors for severity of patients to get better outcomes and to save medical sources.",

A total of 132 patients hospitalized between January 14, 2020 and March 14, 2020 were investigated, of which 96 cured cases were moderate type (moderate-cured), 21 cured cases were severe type (severe-cured) and 15 dead cases were critically ill type (critically ill-died). The gender and age information of those patients were presented in Table S1 and S2. All patients were confirmed by viral detections of SARS-CoV-2 via oropharyngeal swabs using quantitative RT-PCR for ORF1ab [18] , which ruled out infection by other respiratory viruses such as influenza virus A, influenza virus B, coxsackie virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus and enterovirus.",

The serum levels of CRP, PCT, IL-6, percentage of lymphocytes (LYM%), lactic acid and Ct values of viral tests were measured dynamically. The levels of CRP in peripheral blood increased quickly after the symptom onset and further increased to the end around 4 weeks later in the dead cases, while the levels of CRP in survivors fluctuated very little (Fig. 1A) . Similar trend was obtained for the PCT level, although it just began to increase 25 days after disease onset (Fig. 1B) . The blood IL-6 levels in dead cases increased rapidly in the early phase and rose to an extraordinary level before death (Fig. 1C) . In contrast, after the symptom onset, the LYM% in dead cases deceased quickly and sustained in a low level (Fig. 1D ). For the levels of blood lactic acid, there was a narrow time window in which we could distinguish the died and cured groups (Fig. 1E) .

We found that CRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM%, lactic acid and viral load could predict prognosis and guide classification of COVID-19 patients in different degrees. CRP, IL-6 and LYM% were more effective than other three factors in predicting prognosis. CRP and LYM% were sensitive in identifying the types between critically ill and severe (or moderate). Notably, among the investigated factors, LYM% was the only one that could distinguish between the severe and moderate types.",
