Exponential growth is not only threatening lives, but also impacting businesses and disrupting travel around the world. Aim: The aim of this work is to develop an efficient diagnosis of COVID-19 disease by differentiating it from viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia and healthy cases using deep learning techniques. Method: In this work, we have used pre-trained knowledge to improve the diagnostic performance using transfer learning techniques and compared the performance different CNN architectures. Results: Evaluation results using K-fold (10) showed that we have achieved state of the art performance with overall accuracy of 98.75% on the perspective of CT and X-ray cases as a whole. Conclusion: Quantitative evaluation showed high accuracy for automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. Pre-trained deep learning models develop in this study could be used early screening of coronavirus, however it calls for extensive need to CT or X-rays dataset to develop a reliable application.",

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. When a virus spread circulating animal populations affect human population, this is termed as spillover event. It is speculated that the 2019 novel Coronaviurs was originated in bats and was transmitted in humans, possibly with pangloin as an intermediatory hosts. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 (not previously recognized in humans). Unfortunately, COVID-19 is now spreading from humans to humans.",

Common clinical characteristics of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death [25, 3, 13, 9] . However, these symptoms may related to isolated cases e.g. infected CT scan of chest indicated pneumonia while pathogenic test came back positive for the virus. If a person is identified under investigation, samples of lower respiratory will be collected for pathogenic test like sputum, tracheal aspirate, and bronchoalveolar lavage etc. The laboratory technology used sequencing of nucleic acid and real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of COVID-19 [5, 4] . The detection rates of nucleic acid is low estimates (between 30% -50%), due to the factors like availability, quality, quantity, reproducibility and stability of testing and detection kits [5, 4, 28] . Therefore, tests need to be repeated many times after confirmation in many cases.",

The scenario B and C classify Covid19 from bacterial pneumonia and viral pneumonia with 98.75% classification rate using ResNet101. In multiclassification scenarios, it is noted that viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia is classify as healthy subject. It is due to reason that COVID-19 is cause by SARS-COV-2 virus and pneumonia is also cause by virus or bacteria thus we need a strong overlap in the feature space between these two classes. The main reason is as the immunity system of human being has got adaptation towards pre-existing viruses. So, the human being when get infected by old viral pneumonia then the they did not have so many in the the chest x-rays or CT scans. Number of viral pneumonia is mis-classified as a bacterial pneumonia. Another reason is the pediatric x-ray images and virus attacked the child for the first time after the birth. Sometimes, the proposed system mis-classified some images of bacterial pneumonia as COVID-19 and vice versa. In case of COVID-19, when a person get pneumonia then it shows alot changes in the x-rays or CT like bacteria pneumonia or worst because human being has not yet developed the immunity against this novel corona virus. The COVID-19 images are classified accurately by number of architectures of CNN. The accuracy will be increase with increased data, more deep mesoscopic model, and long finetuning transfer learning process.",

[27] presented in Table 6 . Wang et al. [26] deployed transfer learning techniques using Inception model. They conducted experiment on 453 CT scans of pathogen confirmed COVID-19 cases and attained 89.5% accuracy. Another deep learning based system was proposed by Xu et. al. [27] . They differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from Influenza-A viral pneumonia. They used ResNet with Locationattention classification on 618 CT samples and attained 86.7 % accuracy. Our proposed system significantly differentiate the COVID-19 from bacterial pneumonia with 98.75% and COVID-19 from viral pneumonia with 98.51% accuracy respectively. We have deployed nine pre-trained CNN networks to investigate the transfer learning techniques and conclude that fine tuning the pretrained CNN networks can be successfully deployed to a limited class dataset even without augmentation. .

Our system differentiate the COVID-19 from viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia. Our system holds great potential to improve the efficiency of diagnosis, isolation and treatment of COVID-19 patients, relieve the pressure of radiologists, and give control of epidemic. The proposed system 100% classify COVID-19 form healthy, COVID-19 from bacterial pneumonia, and COVID-19 from viral pneumonia using ResNet in binary classification.
