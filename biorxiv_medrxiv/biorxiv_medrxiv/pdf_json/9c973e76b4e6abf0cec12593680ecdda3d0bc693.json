These represent public health-policy measures that are intended to diminish transmission rates and, to this end, aim at reducing person-to-person contacts via so-called social distancing 15 . Examples include school closures 16 , bans on (mass) gatherings 17 , travel restrictions 18, 19 , and even complete lockdowns (e.g., as in the case of France, Spain, and Italy). The impact of NPIs has been primarily studied through theoretical simulations [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Inferences from observational data are primarily of a descriptive nature 14 , focus on single country (i.e., China 27,28 ), or model death rates due to COVID-19 before and after the implementation of NPIs 29 . In contrast, the impact of NPIs in reducing the new COVID-19 cases is unknown. Documented COVID-19 cases, however, are essential for decision-makers in health-policy when monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of NPIs (e.g., controlling the outbreak in a way that surge capacities are not exceeded).",

In contrast, the relative effect of closing venues is ranked among the top. This is an interesting addition to prior literature, in which this NPI has received rather little attention and thus deserves further investigation. Work bans are among the strictest measures and are attributed the second highest effect estimate. In contrast, our model suggests that lockdowns have only a small added value; however, lockdowns also entail a ban on public events and gatherings.

We identified several studies with observational data correlating health-policy measures and SARS-CoV-2 infection rates. These studies focus primarily on the novel coronavirus outbreak in China.

Therefore, it is not clear to what extent NPIs are effective in the later stages of the epidemic. Several countries, which are still in the early stages of the epidemic, are faced with the prospect of implementing health-policies including transmission control measures. Other countries, especially in the developed part of the world, are on a path towards progressively relaxing existing measures. Future research could explore how transmission rates develop when NPIs are sustained for longer periods of time or when NPIs are lifted. Here the effect could point in different directions. On the one hand, people might have integrated social distancing into their daily routines and thus stick to them even after policy measures are lifted. On the other hand, people have postponed several activities with social interactions (e.g., visits to general physicians or shopping activities), which would take place after lifting.",

Our selection of countries defines a sample that follows a similar and comparable overall strategy in controlling the COVID-19 outbreak and shares a common cultural background. In particular, we exclude Asian countries despite the availability of excellent data, as these countries have often responded quite differently based on their experience with previous pandemics such as the 2013 SARS-CoV-1 outbreak. Nevertheless, the sample entails considerable variation across countries, as some countries have been affected severely, while others responded early as part of their mitigation strategy. Overall, the sample covers a population of \u223c0.8 billion people. SARS-CoV-2 infection figures for each country have been obtained from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, which was developed to \"track reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in real time\" 30 and directly aggregates cases recorded by local authorities in order to overcome time delays from alternative reporting bodies.
