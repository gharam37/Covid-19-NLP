Such findings are further corroborated by recent studies, which highlighted that high levels of C-reactive protein, IL-6 and D-Dimer upon admission were predictors of mortality (3, 4) . In their recent Comment, Mehta and colleagues exhorted physicians to screen patients with severe COVID-19 for hyperinflammation and suggested that immunosuppressive and/or immunomodulatory drugs should be investigated in this setting (5) .
