Adapting the classical SEIR-type epidemic modelling framework, the direct person-to-person contact transmission is taken as the direct route of transmission of nCOVID-19 pandemic. In this research, the authors have developed a model of the nation-wide trends of the outburst of the nCOVID-19 infection using an SEIR Model.

The death rate of this novel infection falls between 1-3% (Novel, C. P. E. R.

Then the situation of India will be worst and can not be controlled by any means. It will destroy the whole socio-economic balance of India. Current Mortality rate till 08.03.2020 is nearly about 3%. If this mortality rate persists then a dangerous situation will happen in India. As the development pace of COVID-19 contaminations ascended on 21st March 2020, the Prime Minister of India Shri. Narendra Modi announced a supposed one-day lockdown on 22nd March 2020 in name 'Janata Curfew' which brought down the development pace of cases from 3.69 to 1. (MOHFW, India) . This brought about the statement of a multi-day long further lockdown in the nation to fourteenth April 2020. On the fifth day of the lockdown again an ascent in development pace of contaminated people was watched. This brought up the issue of whether the lockdown is powerful or not. Being a nation of 100 million individuals the viability of conferring lockdown is a significant obstacle to the Government. A minor level of individuals despite everything act slack and careless about the lockdown have become super-spreaders of their locale. Indeed, even 0.1% of oblivious individuals of the nation are an immense populace that can spread the pandemic vivaciously. Another explanation behind an up ascend in new cases during the lockdown time frame might be because of wasteful screening rehearses. Shortage of volunteers, inaccessibility of screening units, inappropriate wilful detailing of patients may likewise be a portion of the fundamental driver of wasteful screening and slanted insights. Be that as it may, the lockdown has significantly hindered the contamination rate contrasted with different nations. It is a way to control this pandemic situation by maintain social distances. But as decided by Indian Government if, after 14 th of April 2020, the total lock down will be relaxed in India, it will increase the factors like contact rate, transmissibility and reproduction number.",

While this isn't a totally unquestionable projection, the model parameters look very reliable, anyway they may mirror an over estimation of the anticipated number of contaminations to redress for the unreported or undetected contaminations.
