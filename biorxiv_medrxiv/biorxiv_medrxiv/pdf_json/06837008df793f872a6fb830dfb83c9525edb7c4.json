These hotlines have struggled with the volume of callers, leading to wait times of hours or, even, an inability to contact health authorities. Symptoma is a symptom-to-disease digital health assistant that can differentiate more than 20,000 diseases with an accuracy of more than 90%. We tested the accuracy of Symptoma to identify COVID-19 using a set of diverse clinical cases combined with case reports of COVID-19. We showed that Symptoma can accurately distinguish COVID-19 in 96.32% of clinical cases. When considering only COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors, Symptoma identified 100% of those infected when presented with only three signs. Lastly, we showed that Symptoma's accuracy far exceeds that of simple \"yes-no\" questionnaires widely available online. In summary, Symptoma provides unparalleled accuracy in systematically identifying cases of COVID-19 while also considering over 20,000 other diseases. Furthermore, Symptoma allows free text input, furthered with disease-specific follow up questions, in 36 languages. Combined, these results and accessibility give Symptoma the potential to be a key tool in the global fight against COVID-19. The Symptoma predictor is freely available online at https://www.",

To track and hopefully curb this pandemic, large-scale laboratory testing for COVID-19 is becoming widespread. However, capacities are far from being able to test whole populations. Therefore many countries have established phone hotlines to pre-screen persons who are unsure about their COVID-19 infection status. Only after talking to an operator and being identified as a potential case, often due to being symptomatic, will laboratory testing occur. However, these hotlines are severely overrun worldwide, leading to hour-long waiting periods and, even, disconnected lines. This ultimately leads to many COVID-19 cases going undiagnosed.",

Digital services are already utilised for assessment and triage in various countries to reduce stress on the emergency responders, e.g., the \"digtal 111\" service provided by the NHS in England 1, 2 . These methods can be grouped into two categories. Firstly, a large number of simple yes/no online questionnaires are available. These questionnaires lead straight to the point but are limited in their informative value. They do not provide a deep understanding of a patient's health situation, they do not allow for the consideration of additional symptoms, they do not allow the generation of additional data for analysis, and, critically, they are often language-and/or country-specific.",

Several have already been developed over recent years (benchmarked in Nateqi et al.) 3 . However, most of these symptom checkers are highly restricted in the number of diseases taken into account as building up the underlying databases is fundamentally cost-intensive and slow. Furthermore, language ambiguities, such as synonyms, are hard to overcome, e.g., dyspnea is the medical term for shortness of breath, though is rarely used outside of medical profession. This inevitably leads to small disease databases where users can only choose from a limited list of pre-defined symptoms, lowering their viability when a new disease emerges.",

            "text": "Above, we compared the symptom-to-disease search engine Symptoma to alternative methods on both COVID-19 and BMJderived decoy cases. We showed that Symptoma is superior to these alternative approaches in multiple aspects. First, Symptoma can correctly identify cases of COVID-19, not only against a few diseases but against more than 20,000 other potential causes. This far exceeds the 6,000 differential diagnoses provided by the second-largest symptom checker \"Isabel Healthcare\" 5 . Secondly, we showed that Symptoma needs only a few symptoms to highlight cases of COVID-19. Crucially, these can be inputted as free text that is semantically understood. For example, if one enters \"Tiramisu\", \"Food Poisoning\" is returned as one of the top results. In contrast, other COVID-19 questionnaires and symptom checkers require that patients only select from a predefined list of symptoms or are constrained to fixed questions. Furthermore, Symptoma is localised into 36 languages, allowing a standardised approach on disease predictions globally. Lastly, we found that Symptoma performs better than simple questionnaire-based approached in identifying COVID-19 cases, even though these alternative approaches only considered three alternative diagnoses (COVID-19, influenza, common cold, and hay fever). Moreover, as Symptoma is constantly mining the newest literature, it keeps up-to-date with the latest knowledge and alters its predictions accordingly, e.g. the recent reports of anosmia in COVID-19 patients 6, 7 . Similarly, by tracking cases of COVID-19 entered into Symptoma, due to the free-text function, new symptoms related to COVID-19 may be highlighted. On these grounds, we believe that Symptoma is a highly valuable tool in the global COVID-19 crisis.",
