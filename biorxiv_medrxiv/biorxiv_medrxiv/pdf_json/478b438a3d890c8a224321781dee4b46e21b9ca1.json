The aim of present study was to develop a SARS-CoV-2 detection protocol which can be performed within minimal resources and timeframe. For this purpose, we implemented the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) methodology for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In order to improve the detection capability, the RT-LAMP assay was developed to simultaneously amplify two viral genes: ORF1a and N. A total of 45 SARS-CoV-2 associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 25 non-COVID-19 cases were enrolled. Viral RNA was extracted from the nasopharyngeal swab samples and analyzed simultaneously using PCR and RT-LAMP protocols.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a global public health emergency since its outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [2] . The current recommended testing method for patients exhibiting clinical features of COVID-19 is the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 via real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). The rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 can be performed on nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs, sputum or alveolar lavage fluid depending upon the sample processing local/international guidelines and available facilities [3, 4] . However, COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted several caveats of the PCR-based testing when it comes down to the point of mass-testing coupled with urgent reporting. For instance, PCR testing requires wellequipped centralized laboratories capable of handling respiratory pathogens, dedicated instruments such as PCR machines and skilled staff to ensure the smooth processing which isn't always possible particularly in less developed or resource limited communities. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 has pushed even the developed nations to levels where they are struggling to ensure rapid and effective testing for every suspected case, one can imagine how catastrophic the situation can be in countries with limited healthcare facilities and resources. In addition, falsenegative PCR results from several COVID-19 patients is also becoming a matter of concern raising questions about the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays [5] [6] [7] . Therefore, a great deal of effort is shifting towards deployment of accurate yet rapid, cost-effective and point-of-care testing methodologies.",

The same approach was applied here, and RT-LAMP was designed to simultaneously detect ORF1a and N genes. Recently, several studies have reported LAMP assays for COVID-19. Overall, all these studies highlight the strength of LAMP especially in situations where a rapid and reliable testing is required. Moreover, few commercially developed isothermal systems are already in pipeline for the approval by the relevant authorities however, majority of the reported SARS-CoV-2 LAMP assays were evaluated on synthetic constructs and lack validation on actual samples. Theoretically, such assays shouldn't suffer from any drastic differences, however, the true sensitivity: specificity profile of an assay demands validation on clinical cohort. Therefore, one strength of our assay is validation on COVID-19 positive patients' samples. As given in Table 1 , dual-gene LAMP assay was able to detect 43 out of 45 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV2 positive samples based upon consensus findings of ORF1a and N genes whereas, none of the non-COVID-19 samples were found to be positive indicating 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The two PCR-positive samples designated as sample A (ID#1112-4) and B (ID# 390-3) showed conflicting results. As shown in Figure 1 , sample A showed positive amplification in N assay whereas no amplification was noted with ORF1a assay. On the other hand, sample B showed positive amplification with ORF1a whereas negative according to the N assay. As we considered same output from both assays to assign samples as positive or negative, we concluded these samples as negative. The Cq value of sample B was 36.90 that is indicate of low viral load whereas, sample A had Cq value 31.30. As there was no additional viral RNA available for testing of sample A and B, the negative result of sample A for ORF1a is currently unclear. On the other hand, positive detection of low viral load sample B is indicative that LAMP ORF1a assay is more sensitive than N assay. Evaluation with additional samples is currently underway.",
