This is an expression of the potential for transmission without any containment measure. However, once interventions are introduced or the susceptibility in the population decreases, the transmission potential at a given time t is measured as the net reproduction number Rt. In this paper, we estimated both R0 and Rt for Italian regions in different epidemiological situations (high, intermediate and low age-adjusted attack rates), selected among those with highest data robustness. We used a previously described Bayesian approach (19) (20) (21) , informed by estimates of the serial interval from contact tracing data in Lombardia (9) . We defined the serial interval as the distribution of the time from symptoms onset in a primary infector and the symptoms onset in secondary cases and estimated it on average to be 6\u00b76 days.

We are unable at this stage to speculate whether the reasons behind this difference are related with hospitalisation policies and practices or whether there are other factors at play. However, this observation confirms recent studies in Lombardia that highlight the potentially catastrophic effects of an uncontrolled COVID-19 epidemic on the healthcare system (8, 9) . Consistently with reported clinical severity, ICU admissions were notified starting from the 20-29 years age segment, suggesting the potential for critical disease also among young adults. The proportion of COVID-19 related ICU admissions, increases until the 60-69 years age segment to decrease in older ages apparently more rapidly than the reported stabilization of more severe disease in the same age groups. This pattern, however, might simply reflect lack of completeness of the surveillance data available at this stage.

Male sex and older age are independent risk factors for COVID-19 related deaths. The CFR of 8.8% documented overall in Italy, is higher than that observed in other countries. As recently described, this could be in part explained by the demographic structure of the Italian population (25) . However, other aspects such as testing policies and the surveillance system characteristics, including the choice in Italy to count only laboratory confirmed cases and to define associated deaths in a very inclusive manner, may also play a role in making initial case fatality data poorly comparable across countries. It is however noteworthy to stress that the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy is characterized by a large number of cases with a short follow-up time since diagnosis. This implies that the overall CFR is currently largely underestimated. This was confirmed when performing an analysis by period of diagnosis. We found that those diagnosed before March 8th, 2020 had an overall CFR of around 20%. Future studies with longer follow-up will better clarify this aspect including studies evaluating overall population excess mortality, which will also be more comparable across countries.",

Considering the predominance of female professionals in working age in the Italian health sector, this is the distribution that would be expected in professionally exposed groups.

While some commentaries have been issued regarding the evolving situation in Italy (25) and initial studies are available on the epidemic in the first affected region Lombardia (8, 9) or based on different modelling approaches, there has been yet no communication to the scientific community of the Italian epidemiological situation at national level based on surveillance data. In this paper, we summarize key epidemiological findings from data on the first 62,843 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Italy, including 5,541 associated deaths, and initial findings on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility across different regions. The added value of this study is of providing an in depth review of the first month of the Italian outbreak through descriptive and analytic epidemiology and an estimation of the R0 and Rt taking into account the diversity of transmission across the country. We believe that the evidence collected in Italy, with a demographic structure and health system organization that differs from those of other countries that had reported sustained disease transmission, can be of support to countries currently experiencing initial or escalating COVID-19 transmission.",

In general terms, when R0 is larger than 1 the infection may spread in the population and the larger R0 the larger effort required to control the epidemic. Once the number of susceptible individuals declines, the transmission potential of the disease at a given time t is measured in terms of the net reproduction number R(t). The net reproduction number is useful to track the effectiveness of performed control measures and other factors affecting the spread of the epidemic (e.g., the behavioral response of the population) over time. As soon as R(t) falls below 1, the epidemic starts to decline.",
