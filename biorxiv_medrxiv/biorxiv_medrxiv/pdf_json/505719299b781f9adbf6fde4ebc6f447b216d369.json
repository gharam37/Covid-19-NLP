            "text": "The emergence and rapid worldwide spread of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has prompted concerted efforts to find successful treatments. The causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), uses its spike (S) protein to gain entry into host cells. Therefore, the S protein presents a viable target to develop a directed therapy. Here, we deployed an integrated artificial intelligence with molecular dynamics simulation approach to provide new details of the S protein structure. Based on a comprehensive structural analysis of S proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and previous human coronaviruses, we found that the protomer state of S proteins is structurally flexible. Without the presence of a stabilizing beta sheet from another protomer chain, two regions in the S2 domain and the hinge connecting the S1 and S2 subunits lose their secondary structures. Interestingly, the region in the S2 domain was previously identified as an immunodominant site in the SARS-CoV-1 S protein. We anticipate that the molecular details elucidated here will assist in effective therapeutic development for COVID-19.",

The S protein is particularly important since it resides on the viral envelope and is responsible for host cell entry by engaging angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors [2] , [9] , [10] . Recent experimental structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein receptor binding domain (RBD) in complex with ACE2 provide detailed interface information [4] , [6] ; targeting this interface represents an active area of research for therapeutic development [11] .

Fig. 1 A-D shows the initial protomer structures of the four S proteins, each highlighted by the three domains. To determine the dynamic change of the domain organization in the protomer structures, we measured the distribution of the interdomain distances from 5,000 structures of each system taken from 25 independent 200 ns MD simulations (Fig. 1 E-G) . Given the limited timescale, we made no attempt to reproduce the thermodynamics but focused on computing the structural features of the systems [17] . The overall distributions of the three interdomain distances are broad, ranging from 40\u00c5 to 110\u00c5 between S2 and NTD/RBD domains and 30\u00c5 to 100\u00c5 between NTD and RBD domains. These wide distributions indicate enhanced structural flexibility in the domain arrangement of the four protomer systems compared to the cryo-EM structures.",

We compared the structures between the protomer and trimer to investigate whether the large structural arrangement of the domains in the protomer is affected by the trimeric state. We found that domain organization is stabilized by trimerization. Unlike the protomer, the three domains are closely arranged in the trimer (Figs. 3 A-B and S4). In addition to their interdomain distances, the differences in structural flexibility between the protomer and trimer is captured in solventaccessible surface area (SASA) values (Fig. 3 C) . The SASA values of the protomer and one chain of the trimer are 532 \u00b1 10 nm 2 and 450 \u00b1 8 nm 2 , respectively. The difference in these values largely comes from their S2 domains, which have the values of 228 \u00b1 7 nm 2 and 170 \u00b1 5 nm 2 , respectively. Again, we applied a CVAE to encode the 10,000 protomer and trimer structures into 3-D latent spaces. We found two individual clusters, one corresponding to the protomer and the other to the trimer, suggesting that the structural features of the two oligomeric states embedded in the latent spaces are different (Fig. 3 D-G) .",

Most differences between the distance matrices result from interdomain arrangement. However, there are some disparities within the S2 domain (Fig. 4 B) . One region of difference corresponds to residue numbers 784 to 810 in the PDB. In the 3-D structure, this region forms a beta sheet in the trimer while the structure is lost in the protomer (Fig. 4 C) . Further investigation into this region reveals that the beta sheet in the trimer is stabilized by another beta sheet constituted by residues 700 to 710 of another chain (Fig. 4 D) . Without the presence of other chains, this stability is lost; not only do residues 784 to 810 in the S2 domain lose the beta sheet structure, but residues 700 to 710 in the hinge region connecting the two subunits become an extended loop (Fig. 4 E) . Oligomeric proteins are often stabilized by oligomerization and hold highly flexible regions in the protomer state [18] . The transition between the structured and unstructured form of these flexible regions is sometime reversible, but due to the size of the S protein protomer and the timescale applied in this study, we did not observe reversible behavior of the two loop regions in the protomer state. Interestingly, a fragment between residues 784 and 810 was identified previously as an immunodominant site in SARS-CoV-1 S protein [19] . Complementary antibodies acting on this site provided the dominant immune response for patients who recovered from the SARS-CoV 1 infection. Our results provide structural comprehension on the previous experimental observation and posit that targeting these residues might not only interfere with S protein trimerization and the subsequent viral activity but also aid antibody immune response. Our findings provide insights into therapeutic design targeting the S protein beyond the oft-targeted RBD domain.",

By first comparing the S protein protomer structure of SARS-CoV-2 to those from previous human coronaviruses, we identified distinct clusters for each virus in the 3-D latent space, where representative structures from these clusters highlight their differences in domain flexibility. Next, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 S protein protomer and trimer structures, which also displayed a clear separation of clusters in the latent space. While the main distinctions between these two states arise from the general gain in structural stability as the protomer self-assembles into the trimer state, we pinpointed structural transitions in specific flexible regions of the protomer that warrant consideration as potential therapeutic targets. These regions are promising as natural targets of immune recognition, but more importantly, they are involved in S protein oligomerization, suggesting they are susceptible to therapeutic action for protein destabilization. Overall, our study provides a more complete molecular view of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein that may assist in accelerating both vaccine and drug design efforts.",

We represented each MD structure by a distance matrix using the C \u21b5 atoms of the protein and generated two input datasets for the CVAEs. Input 1 included the matrices of the protomer structures of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-HKU1. Input 2 included the matrices of the protomer structure and the chain A of the trimer structure of SARS-CoV-2. For Input 1, as the proteins are different in length, we first performed a multiple sequence alignment of the protomer structures of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-HKU1 by Clustal Omega [29] . Based on the alignment, we inserted gaps into the corresponding aligned residue location in the distance matrix and set the distance between gaps to be 0\u00c5. The size of each distance matrix after the alignment was 1,342 \u21e5 1,342. To reduce the matrix size, we applied a convolution layer with padding of 2 and a 14 \u21e5 14 filter with strides of size 7 in both the x and y directions. The size of each resulting matrix became 191 \u21e5 191. Finally, after alignment and size reduction we merged a total of 20,000 distance matrices of the four S proteins. An example of a distance matrix following the alignment and size reduction is represented in Fig. S1 . For Input 2, as the proteins are of the same length, no alignment was required. The size of each matrix was 959 \u21e5 959. We again applied a convolution layer with padding of 1 and a 10 \u21e5 10 filter with strides of size 5 in both the x and y directions to reduce the matrix size. The size of each resulting matrix was also 191 \u21e5 191, and we merged a total of 10,000 distance matrices of the protomer and trimer of SARS-CoV-2 S protein.",

The encoder network of each CVAE consisted of three convolutional layers and a fully connected layer. We used a 3 \u21e5 3 convolution kernel and a stride of 1, 2, and 1 at the three convolutional layers, respectively. We trained each CVAE until the training and validation loss converged. Fig. S2 shows the loss curves along the 150 epochs. The difference between decoded and original images is minimal, suggesting the models were trained successfully (Fig. S3) . We then selected representative structures from the clusters in the latent space and visualized them using VMD [30] .",
