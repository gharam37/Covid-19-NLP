According to formulas (1), when d = 44, t = 60,000, then p = 0.7333(1/10,000), and q = 13637. The incidence of entrying population is 0.7333 (1 / 10,000). On average, there is 13637 entrying persons which bring one COVID-19 patient. In order to find out this patient, 13637 entrying persons must be performed COVID-19 fluorescent RT-PCR testing, 13637 NAT are required. At the cost of RMB 160 per testing, the cost of 13637 NAT 3 are 2.18 million. In order to achieve the same detection result with the minimum number of NAT, we recommend using the methods of batch screening by stages and groups (Schematic flow chart of batch screening by stages and groups At the first stage, all the entrying persons through customs are numbered and grouped, each group has x persons. In a same group, the double nasopharyngeal swabs of each person's are extracted and called sample A, sample B. All of the sample A in a group are mixed together as one sample for a NAT. When the test result is negative, it shows that all of the peple in the group are not infected and the test for the group is complete. On the contrary, when the test result is positive, it indicates that at least one of the samples in the group is positive, and the postive group will enter the second stage of test.At the second stage, all of the sample B in the positive group are performed for NAT one by one, to find out the corresponding patient which sample caused the positive result. In this way, y times NAT required. when a patient are found out , q-y times of the NAT will be saved. We calculate x to get value of y and the more times of NAT could be saved.",

When the test result is negative, it indicates that the test results of all 117 people are negative, and the test of the group is complete. When the test result of the group is positive, it indicates that at least one of the 117 people has a positive test result. All the sample B in the positive group are subjected to the second stage test. In the second stage, all samples B in the positive group will be tested one by one using the NAT, and 117 tests performed. As a result, 234 NAT required. When a patient are found out from 13637, the average every entrying person pays only RMB 2.8 instead of RMB 160 for the NAT. Compared with 13,637 times of NAT, 13,403times tests are saved, equivalent to saving 2.14 million in costs. The percentage saved is 98.3% of the number of NAT (or costs).
