In our investigation, particular surgical isolation and wrapping material fulfilled these criteria. With 3 layers of this material, a filter efficiency of 94% for 0.3 \u00b5m particles, 99% for 0.5 \u00b5m particles, and 100% for 3.0 \u00b5m particles was obtained. After sterilization the filter efficiency allowed re-use as a FFP-1 respirator mask. This knowledge can contribute to global health, in any country and/or hospital that may not have access to otherwise commercial solutions.",

The choice for this material was selected based on its filtering properties and on its availability in most hospitals, and the near-worldwide sales market. The properties were also tested following sterilization to allow re-use of the material. Finally, the potential speed of fabrication of a complete respirator mask was evaluated with the goal of rapid fabrication from basic materials in less than 5 minutes.",

We used 1, 2 or 3 layers of the material and performed measurements on different samples of the tissue. For each particular sample, the test was repeated 4 times. Tests for splash resistance were performed with a water column pressure test. All tests were repeated following a steam sterilization procedure (5 min at 135 degrees Celsius and 2.0 atm. pressure). Some additional tests were carried out with the tissue reversed, or after wearing the respirator mask for 15 min.",

The triple material layers achieved a 93.84% average efficiency for this particle size, which is very close to the requirements of efficiency required for N95 and FFP2 respirator masks (95% [3] and 94% [4] , respectively). The test for splash resistance was included to demonstrate the water resistance of the material, which is not a requirement for respirator masks, but contributes to protection against coughing and sneezing.",
