Our primary goals were to (i) verify that users report their experiences with COVID-19-including their positive test results and symptoms experiencedon Twitter, and to (ii) compare the distribution self-reported of symptoms with those reported in studies conducted in clinical settings. Our secondary objectives were to (i) create a COVID-19 symptom corpus that captures the multitude of ways in which users express symptoms so that natural language processing (NLP) systems may be developed for automated symptom detection, and (ii) collect a cohort of COVID-19-positive Twitter users whose longitudinal self-reported information may be studied in the future. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that focuses on extracting COVID-19 symptoms from public social media. We will make the symptom corpus available with this paper to assist the research community, and it will be part of a larger, maintained data resource-a social media COVID-19 Data Bundle (https://sarkerlab.org/covid_sm_data_bundle/).",

To discover users who self-reported positive COVID-19 tests, we applied a third layer of filtering using regular expressions. We used the expressions 10 and applied the same layers of filers. This provided us with a more manageable set of manual review, although most were still false positives (e.g., ' \u2026 I dreamt that I tested positive for covid \u2026'). We manually reviewed the tweets to identify true selfreports, while discarding the clear false positives. We found some users falsely reporting positive tests, copying posts by celebrities or initially claiming positive tests only to clarify in later tweets that the tests actually came back negative, and we removed these users from our COVID-19-positive set. These multiple layers of filtering gave us a manageable set of potential COVID-19-positive users whose tweets we could analyze semi-automatically. The filtering decisions were made on iteratively-by collecting sample data for hours and days, and then updating the collection strategy based on analyses of the collected data.",

We did not include tweets earlier than that because we assumed that symptoms posted prior to that would not be related to COVID-19, particularly because our data collection started in late February and most of the positive test announcements we detected were from late March to early April. Since we were interested in identifying patient-reported symptoms only in this study, we tried to shortlist tweets that were likely to mention symptoms. To perform this, we first created a meta-lexicon by combining MedDRA, 11 Consumer Health Vocabulary (CHV), 12 and SIDER. 13 Lexicon-based approaches are known to have low recall particularly for social media data since social media expressions are often non-standard and contain misspellings. 14,15 Therefore, instead of searching the tweets for exact expressions from the tweets, we performed inexact matching using a string similarity metric. Specifically, for every symptom in the lexicon, we searched windows of sequences of characters in each tweet that had similarity values above a specific threshold. We used the levenshtein ratio as the similarity metric, computed as 1 \u2212 . .",

We observed a common trend among Twitter users of describing their day-to-day disease progression since the onset of symptoms. This trend perhaps became popular as celebrities started describing their symptoms on Twitter. We saw many reports from users who tested positive but initially showed no symptoms, and some who expressed anosmia and/or ageusia as the only symptoms, which were documented in the comparison studies. There are some studies that suggest that anosmia and ageusia may be the only symptom of COVID-19 among otherwise asymptomatic patients. [20] [21] [22] The most likely explanation behind the differences between symptoms reported on Twitter versus clinical studies is that the former were reported mostly by users who had milder infections, while people who visited hospitals often went there to receive treatment for more serious symptoms. Also, the median ages of the patients studied in clinical studies tended to be much higher than the median age of Twitter users (in the U.S., median Twitter user age is 40 23 ). In contrast to the clinical studies, in our cohort, some users expressed stress and anxiety suffered after testing positive. It was difficult in many cases to ascertain if the mental health issues were directly related to COVID-19 or whether the users had prior histories of such conditions.",
