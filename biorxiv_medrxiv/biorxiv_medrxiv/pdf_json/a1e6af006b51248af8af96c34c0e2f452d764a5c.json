The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend a standard assay that includes an RNA extraction step from a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab followed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect the purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The current global shortage of RNA extraction kits has caused a severe bottleneck to COVID-19 testing. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected from NP samples via a direct RT-qPCR assay that omits the RNA extraction step altogether, and tested this hypothesis on a series of blinded clinical samples. The direct RT-qPCR approach correctly identified 92% of NP samples (n = 155) demonstrated to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by traditional clinical diagnostic RT-qPCR that included an RNA extraction. Thus, direct RT-qPCR could be a front-line approach to identify the substantial majority of COVID-19 patients, reserving a repeat test with RNA extraction for those individuals with high suspicion of infection but an initial negative result. This strategy would drastically ease supply chokepoints of COVID-19 testing and should be applicable throughout the world.",

The current diagnostic testing methods recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States and the World Health Organization (WHO) are traditional RT-qPCR assays that require two steps: first, an RNA extraction from patient nasopharyngeal (NP) swab material, followed by RT-qPCR amplification of the extracted RNA to detect viral RNA 1-3 . The major bottleneck to widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing lies at the RNA extraction step. The simplest manual kit (the Qiagen Viral RNA Mini) is no longer available, and reagents and supplies for the larger automated instruments are extremely limited with uncertain supply chains. While substitution of other RNA extraction kits 4,5 is possible, they too are in limited supply. The current bottleneck is not simply the availability of RNA extraction kits, but also the cost of the extraction assay, the labor and time required to perform it, and the fact that it is rate limiting compared to the downstream RT-qPCR analysis. To address this issue, we tested the unconventional approach of skipping the RNA extraction step altogether and directly loading patient swab material into the RT-qPCR mix. Herein, we report that this approach (which we refer to hereafter as \"direct RT-qPCR\") correctly identified 92% of samples (n =155) previously shown to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by conventional RT-qPCR featuring an RNA extraction. Thus, our results suggest that this streamlined assay could greatly alleviate constraints to COVID-19 testing in many regions of the world.",

The SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy levels in these samples were previously determined at UW by standard clinical RT-qPCR that included RNA extraction. To address the potential impact of a prior heating step on detection sensitivity, NP swab samples were heated or not for 10 min at 95\u00b0C prior to use in the downstream RNA extraction and/or direct RT-qPCR. For each NP swab sample, a 3 \u00b5L volume of diluent was used for direct RT-qPCR. In parallel, a 30 \u00b5L aliquot of each sample was used for RNA extraction and an equivalent of 3 \u00b5L of the original swab diluent used for RT-qPCR, allowing for a one to one comparison with the .

To control for inhibitors of the RT or PCR enzymes and/or RNase activity in the swab diluent, an aliquot of each swab diluent was spiked with 4 x 10 4 copies of EXO control RNA for subsequent detection with an EXO primer-probe set; no inhibition was noted under any of the tested conditions. Supplementary Table 1 shows the full results of this experiment while Table 2 provides a summary. Fig. 2 shows the CT values from the original clinical RT-qPCR done on the equivalent of 20 \u00b5L of NP swab diluent versus those obtained by direct or standard RT-qPCR when measuring 3 \u00b5L (or equivalent) of swab diluent. There were several key observations from this experiment. First, preheating NP swab samples prior to direct RT-qPCR enhanced assay sensitivity (e.g. 138 of 150 samples were detected following a heat step, compared with only 126 of 150 positive in the absence of preheating). Second, extraction of RNA prior to RT-qPCR did not enhance detection of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples when an equivalent amount of diluent was screened by direct RT-qPCR (138 of 150 samples were detected by each approach). This suggests one of the primary advantages of kit-based RNA extraction comes from concentrating the sample material so more RNA can be loaded into the RT-qPCR reaction. Third, 11 of the 12 samples not detected by direct RT-qPCR were from donors that had extremely low loads of viral RNA as originally determined in the clinical test (CTs ranging from 33 to 38). Fourth, preheating samples reduced sensitivity when using the Roche MagnaPure 96 RNA extraction system, but had little effect on the direct RT-qPCR approach. Finally, the results from the EXO spiking experiment indicate that the NP swab diluent does not inhibit the direct RT-qPCR assay. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the direct RT-qPCR assay described here is capable of reliably detecting the substantial majority of COVID-19 patients.",

A major chokepoint is the RNA extraction step, due to both the time and labor for this step and the critical shortage of extraction kits and required reagents. As a means to circumvent these limitations on clinical testing availability, we have shown that a direct RT-qPCR approach that omits an RNA extraction step can effectively identify SARS-CoV-2 RNA from NP swabs. Further, direct RT-qPCR is able to detect host RNA from NP swabs, which enables us to rule out false negatives due to inadequate swabbing of patients resulting in a paucity of intact RNA in the specimen, or due to the presence of inhibitors. When applied to a large collection of clinical NP specimens representative of the range of COVID-19 patients in the state of Washington, the direct RT-qPCR assay correctly identified 92% of the donors screened. The only donors that our simplified approach missed were those with the very lowest load of viral RNA (and who were on the very cusp of detection even when RNA extraction was used). Of the 1,872 cases with a positive diagnosis at UW by our team at the time of this writing, only ~25% would fall into this low copy range, which indicates that this assay will detect the substantial majority of COVID-19 patients. Indeed, after we posted our initial results on bioRxiv 4 , two additional groups posted preliminary data on bioRxiv and medRxiv replicating these findings, using standard clinical diagnostic methods in Chile and Denmark 6, 7 . The simplified approach we present here may be especially well suited for general screening of the public and identification of \"silent carrier\" individuals. Where resources permit, we envision that a two-step testing algorithm in which a repeat test including RNA extraction could be applied for symptomatic patients, health care workers, and others with a high index of suspicion but an initial negative result. Such a two-step strategy would reduce the need for RNA extraction for a substantial portion of future COVID-19 tests.

Each patient sample, as well as no template control (water as well as M6 transport media) was run in duplicate, the synthetic RNA standard was run in triplicate. The initial experiment was run on an ABI QuantStudio 6 Flex (Fig. 1a) , while subsequent experiments were run on an ABI 7500 Fast (Figs. 1b-d) . Reagent preparations were performed in a PCR-free clean room equipped with PCR workstations (AirClean Systems). Clinical sample manipulations (RNA extractions or direct addition of NP swab diluent to RT-qPCR plates) were done in a Class IIA Biosafety Cabinet using BSL-2 precautions. RT-qPCR plates were placed directly in biosafety waste at the conclusion of each run.

For direct RT-PCR, 3 \u00b5L of this sample, or 5 \u00b5L of extracted RNA, was added directly into the RT-PCR reaction mixture. Each real-time RT-PCR reaction contained 400 nM of CDC N2 forward and reverse primers and 100 nM of N2 probe. To monitor potential RT-PCR inhibition, each RT-PCR reaction was spiked with 40,000 copies of EXO internal control RNA and EXO primers (100 nM of EXO forward and 200 nM of EXO reverse) and probes (62.5 nM). Real-time RT-PCR assays were performed using AgPath-ID One Step RT-PCR kit (Life Technologies) and an ABI 7500 Real Time PCR system was used to perform the RT-PCR reactions 8 . For samples that were subjected to RNA extraction, 40,000 copies of EXO RNA was spiked into the lysis buffer.

All assays used the 2019-nCoV_N2 primer/probe set. Direct RT-qPCR was performed on 3 \u00b5L of NP swab diluent after heating for 10 minutes at 95\u00b0C (green circles). In parallel, RNA was extracted from 30 \u00b5L of NP swab diluent that had been previously heated at 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes, and RNA representing 3 \u00b5L of the original diluent was used in RT-qPCR (purple circles) to allow a head to head comparison to direct RT-qPCR on the same quantity of NP swab diluent. The limit of detection (40 CT) is denoted with a dashed line. Samples with CT values above this cutoff were considered negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The fitted curves are LOESS-smoothed (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) CT values, with 95% confidence interval in gray, against the mean of CT values detected in the clinical RT-qPCR assay with primer sets N1 & N2. Samples are ordered by the latter mean. The full data set for this experiment and controls is provided in Supplementary Table 1. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.
