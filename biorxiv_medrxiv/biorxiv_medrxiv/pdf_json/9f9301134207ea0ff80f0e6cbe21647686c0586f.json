In response to such a volatile situation in the world, governments and the scientific communities have been actively studying the underlying principles and possible reasons for the disease spread and progression. For example, Bai et.al. [1] have first discovered that COVID-19 could have been possibly transmitted by asymptomatic carriers, while Wu et.al. [2] conducted a large-scale study based on 72, 314 confirmed cases listing important actionable lessons for other societies to apply. Furthermore, the Computer Science community has analyzed the disease spread from a statistical point of view.

Considering the uneven pace of the disease's geographical spread The actual number of the data records in the dataset is 286 as for some countries the COVID-19 statistics in the original data set was given for different regions within the same country: 54 regions in the United States of America, 33 regions in China, 10 regions in Canada,",
