Once a highly contagious disease takes place in a location the movement patterns aid in predicting the potential spatial spreading of the disease, hence mobile data becomes a crucial tool to epidemic models. In this work, based on millions of anonymized mobile visits data in Brazil, we investigate the most probable spreading patterns of the COVID-19 within states of Brazil. The study is intended to help public administrators in action plans and resources allocation, whilst studying how mobile geolocation data may be employed as a measure of population mobility during an epidemic. The first part of the study focus on the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro during the period of March 2020, when the disease first started to spread in these states. Metapopulation models for the disease spread were simulated in order to evaluate the risk of infection of each city within the states, by ranking them according to the time the disease will take to infect each city. We observed that, although the high risk regions are those closer to the capital cities, where the outbreak has started, there are also cities in the countryside with great risk.",

Since March 2020, when the disease was classified by WHO as a pandemic [12] , countries around the world have followed protocols implemented months before in Asia, enforcing a variety of interventions, from mild to radical ones, based on social distancing, isolation and quarantine, to slow the disease spread, as recommended by WHO [10] . It is a common sense that the pandemic should be fought in two frontiers: by saving lives while avoiding the collapse of health systems, and by protecting the population from the economic impacts of the pandemic, specially its most vulnerable parcel [12] . For either goal to be achieved, health officials and government authorities should have reliable information about the disease spreading and its economic and social impacts, hence, for instance, the modelling of such spreading is not only a scientific achievement, but also a source of crucial strategic information. Indeed, a way of reducing the damages caused by the pandemic is to model how the disease will spread, in order to properly assign the available resources to locations where they will be needed the most.",

Initial reports have shown the efficacy of these interventions, but we still lack reliable data, specially in Brazil, and, even when the data is available, we need to sort out misleading information [3] . Among the several challenges to address this pandemic, detecting the spatial spread of the disease within a region is one of the top priorities. An early warning can give time for government authorities to prepare the health system in a location to endure the increase on the number of people in need of medical care. One way to overcome this challenge is to monitor human mobility in order to detect patterns from which to predict future focus of infection, to either asses the efficacy of implemented policies to avoid transmission, or drive policies with the goal of avoiding the transmission to certain locations. This monitoring, specially using mobile phone data, has been noted to be an efficient way to follow public mobility. In recent work, [3] has indicated the efficacy of the intervention in China, correlating mobile data with reported cases. In other report, mobile data has evidenced the effect of Government-enforced measures in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, in reducing social contact [5] . It is worth noting that, for large scale movements, other measures beyond mobile phone data have been successfully used to foresee the spread of the disease in Brazil [4] .",

For large scales, such as big countries, continents and the whole world, available airport data is enough to give us reliable predictions. As mentioned, [4] has some interesting results for the dissemination of the COVID-19 in Brazil based on airport network. But once the epidemics reaches a primary local region, it is of relevance to anticipate how the dissemination will take place locally, so local transit and regional road movement play an important role in the modelling, and mobile data provide a reliable characterization of such movements.",

We concentrate on these states as they were the first ones in Brazil to have significant number of confirmed cases and local transmission. To model the mobility via mobile data we have established a fruitful collaboration with Brazilian company In Loco ( https://inloco.com.br/ ). In Loco provides software engineering services to mobile phone applications and has a database with more than 60 million devices. The anonymized data provided by them contain the physical location where billions of visits to selected apps have occurred. Although no civil information is collected, such as name or social security number, in deference to users' privacy concerns, In Loco can detect, through anonymous tracking, the most likely devices' locations across the country and the movement between them.",

To predict theses focus, we analyse the raw mobility data and simulate spatial models of disease spread to predict the locations where the disease is more likely to spread first. This study seeks to not only subsidize public discussions about the allocation of resources and enforcement of isolation measures, but also to be the base of a next study, addressing population dynamics together with available public health data, providing risk assessments and forecasts.",

This causes the proportion of movement from A to other regions to be overestimated, as we observe proportions as high as 45% of the movements from a region being to out of it, what is an unrealistic estimation of the proportion of people which move to outside of a region. A more realistic number is no more than 5%, what we believe would be obtained if we had the number of recordings in which the uses occurred in a same location. This overestimation will be corrected in the models simulating the disease spread, but when analysing raw data we disregard any correction, as we are only interested in determining common movements, and are not interested in how common they are . Even though this proportion is not a consistent estimator, in a statistical sense, of the proportion of a population which travels from a region to another within 24 hours, as a same device may be recorded twice in the period of a day, it is a good proxy for the mobility between two regions, as represents in reality a person which traveled from one region to another within 24 hours, or stayed in a same region. As the data is anonymized and each device is followed for only two uses of the app, we do not actually know if the movement is that of a person which is returning to a location or going there the first time, for example. However, this proportion gives a good idea of possible patterns followed by a population in general, as if a pattern is recurrent in the population it may also be in our dataset, although the proportion of movements in the population may be distinct of the one we calculated, i.e., we may be able to identify common patterns of mobility, even though we cannot estimate properly, in a statistical sense, the proportion of the population which leave one region and go to another in the period of a day.",

For this purpose, we disregard the first days of March 2019, as the mobility was influenced by a major Brazilian holiday, the carnival week, so we observe the pattern of mobility in March 2019 starting on the 11th.

The spread within each location is modelled as a SI model, while the spread between locations is based on the mobile data, more specifically on the transition matrices. In the proposed model, the evolution of , the number of infected in region at time , is modelled as in which is the transmission rate within each region, is a free parameter used to correct the overestimation or underestimation of movement between the locations, is the population of region and is a measure of the movement from region to region at time , calculated from the transition matrices in the following way.",

The model chosen was adequate to be used with the available disease information, namely, the Basic Reproduction Number R 0 estimated from the initial spread in China. We also introduced , a free parameter, used to correct the overestimation or underestimation of movement between the locations. As expected, parameter is related to the intensity of mobility, which in turn implies a greater or smaller time of infection for each city. This is an indicative that the decrease in mobility, enforced by isolation and quarantine measures, may slow the spread of the disease. Also, we proposed a risk index, based on ranks of the estimated time for an infected individual to be identified in a specific city. The risk index was shown to be robust and consistent with the spreading patterns, independent of the mobility intensity parameter s .",
