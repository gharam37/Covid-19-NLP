Based on the early preliminary analysis of the publicly available data we propose a number of arguments and observations providing further support for the correlation hypothesis and make an observation that the effectiveness of the protection effect of BCG immunization, if confirmed, may depend to a significant extent on the age of administration, with the early age inoculation more effective for the lasting protection.",

Quite pronounced is the difference between the \"avalanche\" scenario seen in Italy, Spain, France and USA on one hand, and the \"mild\" one (Taiwan, Germany, many East European jurisdictions and others) on the other. While multiple factors certainly play role in these variations, some can be more influential on the overall dynamics of the impacts of the epidemics. A possible link between the effects of Covid-19 pandemics such as the rate of spread and the severity of cases; and a universal immunization program against tuberculosis with BCG vaccine (UIP, hereinafter) was suggested in [1] . In this work we provide several additional arguments supporting the case for such correlation based on the available data in the public domain. Further analysis of statistical data is needed to achieve a confident conclusion.",
