Consequently, the magnitude and the quality of 68 primary effector CD8 + T cell response often is compromised in aged hosts following pathogen 69 challenge [5] . Likewise, the development of CD8 + memory T cell responses in the circulation 70 and/or in the lymphoid organs is often impaired during aging [6, 7] . This age-related CD8 + T cell 71 attrition in memory T cell differentiation and/or function has been linked to impaired host 72 responses to pathogens following primary infection or vaccination in aged hosts [8] . 73 74 Tissue-resident memory CD8 + T cells (TRM) with potent effector potential are mainly located in 75 peripheral tissue at portals of pathogen entry, whereas circulating central and effector memory T 76 cells survey lymphoid organs and/or peripheral tissues [9, 10] . It has been shown that CD8 + TRM 77 cells can provide nearly sterilizing protection if present in sufficient numbers [11] . Therefore, 78 great enthusiasm has recently centered on enhancing local CD8 + TRM responses as a promising 79 vaccination strategy to control mucosal infections including influenza virus infection [12] . Much 80 progress has been made recently regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating 81 TRM cell development and maintenance [13, 14] . However, relatively less is known regarding the 82 effects of aging in the development and/or function of TRM responses in the mucosal tissues 83 following primary infection. Of note, analysis of spatial and temporal maps of T cell 84 compartmentalization revealed that aged lungs harbor increased levels of CD8 + CD69 + TRM-like 85 cells compared to young lungs [1] . However, it is unclear whether this is caused by a gradual 86 depletion of CD8 + TRM cells resulted in decreased tissue inflammation and lowered lung collagen 123 deposition. Thus, we have discovered an age-associated paradox in CD8 + TRM cell responses. 124 CD8 + TRM cell accumulation in aged hosts was not coupled to enhanced protective immunity, but 125 rather, to chronic lung pathology and fibrotic sequelae following primary viral pneumonia.

( Figure 1D ) similar to previous reports [23] . 166 167 Recent clinical and experimental evidence suggests that severe acute influenza infection may 168 cause persistent lung pathology, remodeling, and pulmonary dysfunction [20, 24] . To determine 169 whether these acute differences in host morbidity result in differential tissue pathological 170 sequela, we examined the kinetics of histopathology in the lungs following acute PR8 infection 171 in young and aged hosts. While common features of pulmonary aging such as enlarged alveoli 172 were observed prior to infection (0 d.p.i.), leukocytic infiltrates were not prominent in either 173 aged or young naive lungs ( Figure 1E ). At peak of host inflammatory responses and weight-loss 174 (9 d.p.i.) and even several weeks later (30 d.p.i.) , lung histopathology and tissue damage 175 appeared comparable between young and aged mice ( Figure 1E & F). However, at 60 d.p.i., 176 lungs from aged mice showed a higher density of parenchymal disruption compared to lungs 177 from young mice ( Fig. 1E & F) . These data suggest that acute influenza virus infection in aged 178 mice results in persistent non-resolving pathological pulmonary responses. 179 180 To confirm these lung histopathological data, we examined the presence of inflammatory 181 monocytes and neutrophils, two major inflammatory cells that can cause pulmonary 182 inflammation and tissue damage [22, 25] . To discern the anatomical location of the cell 183 infiltrates, we examined the vascular and parenchymal fractions of the lungs through the 184 injection of intravenous CD45 antibody (Ab) 5 min before sacrifice [26] ( Figure 1G ). In this 185 setting, CD45i.v.cells were within lung tissue, while CD45i.v. + cells were in lung blood vessels. 186",

In contrast, 208 348 unique DEGs were observed at day 60 post-infection in aged groups compared to infected 209 young lungs ( Figure 1I , bottom right panel). Among those DEGs, influenza infection led to 210 greatly increased expression of myeloid cell-associated genes, cytokine and chemokine genes, 211 and genes involved in lymphocyte responses in aged lungs (Figure S1A-C). Together, these data 212 indicated that the immune landscape of aged and young lungs is grossly similar prior to 213 infection, but aged lungs exhibit greatly exacerbated inflammatory gene expression and failed to 214 return to immune homeostasis months after primary infection. 215 could be due to increased infiltration of effector T cells in aged mice. We therefore examined 247 effector T cell responses in the lungs and spleens at 10 d.p.i. We found that while D b -PA 248 responses appear to be equivalent in the lungs between young and aged mice, there was a deficit 249 in the generation of D b -NP specific CD8 + T cells in the lungs ( Figure 2K ). Furthermore, there 250 were significantly lower levels of both D b -NP and D b -PA effector T cells in the spleens and 251 circulation ( Figure 2K ) of aged mice compared to controls as previously reported [33] . 252 Therefore, aged mice exhibit enhanced CD8 + TRM numbers despite having lower levels of 253 effector T cell responses. 254 255 Influenza-specific lung memory CD8 + T cells of aged hosts are tissue resident 256",

However, TGFbRII 305 deficiency did not significantly affect splenic memory T cell responses in young or aged mice 306 ( Figure 4G ). Thus, these data suggest that excessive accumulation of CD8 + TRM cells in aged 307 lungs is dependent on d TGF-bR signals in aged tissue environment. 308 309 Age-associated dysfunction of TRM cells against a major protective epitope 310 TRM cells are vital for heterologous influenza virus reinfection [43] . Since aged lungs 311 accumulated significant more CD8 + TRM cells, it is plausible that aged mice may exhibit 312 enhanced protective heterologous immunity against viral reinfection. To this end, we employed a 313 heterologous infection and challenge model in which we infected young or aged mice with PR8 314 virus and then re-challenge the mice with a lethal dose of X31 virus in the presence of FTY720, 315 which blocks the contribution of protective circulating memory T cells [12] . PR8 and X31 316 viruses differ in viral surface proteins, but share internal viral proteins such as NP, which are 317 cross-recognized by memory CD8 + T cells [44, 45] . We confirmed that FTY720 treatment 318 abolished T cell migration ( Figure S4A ). We then followed host morbidity and mortality daily 319 following X31 challenge. All na\u00efve young or aged mice succumbed to lethal X31 infection 320 ( Figure S4B ), while PR8-infected young mice were fully protected from lethal X31 infection in 321 the presence of FTY720 ( Figure 5A ). Strikingly, ~75% of PR8-infected aged animals succumbed 322 to secondary X31 re-challenge, which was almost comparable to mortality of primary X31 323 infection in those mice ( Figure 5A and S4B). Thus, the enhanced presence of CD8 + TRM cells in 324 aged lungs failed to provide heterologous protection against influenza reinfection. 325 326 Among influenza-specific CD8 + T cells, D b -NP-specific T cells appear to be particularly critical 327 for the protection against secondary heterologous viruses [46] . To examine the mechanisms 328 underlying the impaired protective function of TRM cells in aged lungs, we sorted polyclonal D b -329 NP-specific TRM from infected young or aged lungs, and performed scRNAseq at 60 d.p.i. 330 ( Figure S4C ). Compared to D b -NP TRM cells from aged mice, D b -NP TRM from the young mice 331 were enriched in genesets associated with NF-kB signaling and inflammatory immune responses 332 ( Figure 5B ). Furthermore, D b -NP TRM from aged mice had decreased expression of effector 333 molecules such as Ifng and Tnf, and molecules involved with TCR signaling such as Lck and 334",

Of note, splenic CD8 + memory T 355 cells were also impaired in producing both IFN-g and TNF following peptide re-stimulation 356 during aging ( Figure S5A ), suggesting that the impaired production of functional effector 357 molecules following peptide re-stimulation was not restricted to TRM cells. In contrast to their 358 diminished cytokine production following peptide stimulation (TCR signaling), total CD8 + or 359 D b -NP-specific TRM cells were capable of producing IFN-g and TNF following PMA/Ionomycin 360 restimulation ( Figure S5B , C). These data suggest that D b -NP TRM cells exhibit impaired 361 production of effector molecules specifically following TCR stimulation. Interestingly, following 362 ex vivo stimulation of D b -PA specific TRM cells by PA 224-233 peptide, we found that D b -PA 363 TRM cells from aged and young hosts had similar ability to produce IFN-g and TNF ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.040196 doi: bioRxiv preprint T cells drive chronic lung pathology at the memory phase. Consistent with the histology data, 388 high dose, but not low dose, of CD8 Ab treatment caused significant reduction of Ly6C + 389 monocyte and neutrophil infiltration in aged, but not young lung tissues ( Figure 6F ). Thus, 390 resident CD8 + T cells are responsible for the constant recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils 391 to the tissue at the memory phase. To further explore the roles of resident CD8 T cells in 392 promoting tissue inflammation at the memory stage, we measured immune-associated genes in 393 the lungs by Nanostring. There was a marked decrease in the expression of multiple cytokines 394 and particular chemokines in the lungs of mice that received high CD8 Ab treatment, compared 395 to those of lungs of mice received control Ab or low dose of CD8 Ab at 60 d.p.i.

CD8 + T cell depletion did not affect lung collagen 402 content in infected young mice revealed by both Mason's trichrome staining and hydroxyproline 403 assay ( Figure 6H and I), which measures total collagen protein [49] . These data suggest that 404 normal CD8 + TRM cell responses in young mice contribute minimally to lung fibrotic responses 405 following acute influenza virus infection, which is in contrast to the excessive CD8 + TRM cell-406 induced fibrotic sequelae following PD-L1 blockade [41] . In contrast to young mice, aged mice 407 exhibited increased lung collagen deposition, particularly in the lung parenchyma ( Figure 6H & 408 J). Strikingly, mice received high CD8 Ab treatment had markedly reduced lung fibrosis as 409 revealed by Trichome staining and hydroxyproline assay, compared to lungs of mice that 410 received control Ab or low dose of CD8 Ab ( Figure 6J & K). These data suggest that resident but 411 not circulating CD8 + T cells are important in promoting chronic lung collagen deposition 412 following the resolution of primary influenza infection. In summary, our data indicate that 413 excessive accumulation of lung resident CD8 + T cells does not lead to enhanced protective 414 immunity in aged mice, but rather drive age-associated persistent lung inflammation and chronic 415 fibrosis following viral pneumonia.

Somewhat counterintuitively, elevated CD8 + TRM cells in the aged lung, 436 fail to provide the protective heterologous immunity to that observed in young mice, likely due 437 to a selective dysfunction in a protective CD8 + TRM cell population ( Notably, despite a numeric increase in TRM cells, protective heterologous immunity is impaired 450 in aged hosts due to a qualitative defect in TRM cells not present in young mice. The protective 451 function of TRM cells is usually associated with their effector activities at the site of pathogen re-452 entry [56] . For instance, it has been shown that IFN-g is important for TRM cell protective 453 immunity against secondary heterologous influenza virus infection [43] . Consistent with the 454 notion, scRNAseq analysis found that TRM cells against a major protective CD8 + T cell epitope 455 (D b -NP) from aged mice lose a functional TRM subset observed in young hosts; this subset was 456 characterized with robust expression of molecules associated with TCR signaling and effector 457 molecules. As a result, D b -NP specific TRM cells are less sensitive to TCR stimulation for the 458 simultaneous production of IFN-g and TNF. Thus, defective TCR-mediated effector cytokine 459 production could underlie the impaired protection against secondary influenza virus infection.

To test this hypothesis, we infected aged mice with PR8 virus and then injected 378 the mice with high or low doses of CD8 depleting antibody (a-CD8) at 21 d.p.i. to deplete CD8 + 379 T cells systemically in lymphoid and peripheral tissues (high dose) or only in lymphoid organs 380 and the circulation (low dose) [40, 47, 48] (Figure 6A).

Our 444 data further indicate that aged environment, likely through elevated tissue TGF-b, promotes TRM 445 cell generation and/or maintenance in a T cell-extrinsic fashion during aging. Of note, aging has 446 been linked to altered na\u00efve T cell repetoires and enhanced representation of senescent virtual 447 memory T cells [54].

Previously, it has been shown that memory T cells in aged mice are senescent in 462 proliferation during secondary expansion[8]. Therefore, it is also possible that impaired TRM 463 proliferation and secondary effector T cell expansion could together contribute to the impaired effector cytokine production by D b -NP TRM cells was not observed in D b -467 PA or transferred young OT-I TRM cells, suggesting that this functional defect in D b -NP T cells is 468 likely not caused by the aged environment. It has been shown that D b -NP, but not D b -PA, CD8 + 469 T cells have preferential age-associated loss in responsiveness, which is mainly due to the 470narrowed TCR-b repertoire in D b -NP CD8 + T cells or their recruitment into a response [6, 28, 471 32]. Thus, intrinsic developmental defects are likely the cause of the functional decline in D b -NP 472 TRM cells [28]. Notably, our data highlight the importance of D b -NP TRM cells in protective 473 immunity as functional impairment specifically in D b -NP cells could translate into differences in 474 the secondary protective immunity. This notion is consistent with previous reports, which have 475 pinpointed robust expansion of D b -NP memory T cells over D b -PA memory T cells in the 476 secondary expansion to provide enhanced protective immunity following heterologous TRM cells exhibit higher levels of expression of multiple effector molecules compared to 480 central and effector memory T cells [13, 60]. The heightened expression of these molecules 481 confers CD8 + TRM cells with superb antiviral function, but may potentially cause bystander tissue 482 inflammation and injury [41]. In experimental models, both CD4 + and CD8 + TRM cells have been 483 implicated in causing tissue immunopathology ranging from persistent allergic inflammation to 484 inflammatory bowel disease [61, 62]. Previous reports have demonstrated that influenza 485 infection in young mice leads to chronic inflammation and collagen deposition [24]. Notably, 486resident CD8 + T cell depletion only moderately affected pulmonary inflammation and lung 487 collagen deposition in young mice, even though exaggerated CD8 + TRM responses following PD-488 1 blockade can lead to inflammatory and fibrotic sequelae[41]. These data suggest that 489 influenza-infected young lungs are able to tolerate \"normal levels\" of TRM cells, likely due to the 490 expression of various inhibitory molecules expressed by TRM cells[41]. During aging, however, 491 influenza virus infection leads to excessive accumulation of TRM cells, which exceeds the ability 492 of the aged tissue to \"counterbalance\" the pathogenic activities of TRM cells, driving enhanced 493 pulmonary inflammation and parenchymal fibrosis.

Alternatively, it is possible that enhanced accumulation of those 502 \"functionally-intact\" TRM cells such as D b -PA TRM cells may be responsible for the persistent 503 tissue inflammation and fibrosis in aged hosts. Additionally, TRM cells in aged mice may have 504 different traits than TRM cells in young mice [63, 64], thereby causing increased lung 505 inflammation and tissue fibrosis. 506 507 Aging is associated with enhanced development of a number of chronic lung diseases including 508 chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and pulmonary fibrosis [65]. Interestingly, 509 aging is also associated with increased susceptibility of acute lung injury and severe disease 510 development following respiratory viral infections such as influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 [17, 511 66, 67]. Increasing evidence has suggested that acute viral infections may cause persistent lung 512 function impairments due to pulmonary fibrosis [20]. Indeed, lung fibrosis is well-documented in 513 a substantial number of patients who have recovered from the infection of SARS-CoV or MERS-514 CoV [68, 69] and a group of influenza patients with severe acute diseases [20]. Emerging 515 evidence has also suggested that COVID-19 survivors will likely exhibit persistent impairment 516 of lung function and the development of pulmonary fibrosis [21, 70-74]. Data presented here 517 suggests for the first time that excessive TRM cells are likely the cause of chronic lung diseases 518 and pulmonary fibrosis following viral pneumonia in aged individuals. Of note, recent data on 519 scRNAseq analyses have suggested that pulmonary T cells from COVID-19 patients are enriched 520 with TRM signature and CD8 + T cell clonal expansion in the airways 521 (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026690). Thus, strategies aimed at decreasing 522 exuberant TRM responses and/or inhibiting the pathogenic potential of TRM cells may be 523 promising in treating chronic lung diseases following viral pneumonia in the elderly,",
