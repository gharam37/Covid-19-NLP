Currently, no effective vaccine is available to prevent COVID-19 and an intense global development activity is in progress. In this context, the different technology platforms face several challenges resulting from the involvement of a new virus still not fully characterised. Finding of the right conditions for virus amplification for the development of vaccines based on inactivated or attenuated whole viral particles is among them. Here, we describe the establishment of a workflow based on shotgun tandem mass spectrometry data to guide the optimisation of the conditions for viral amplification. In parallel, we analysed the dynamic of the host cell proteome following SARS-CoV-2 infection providing a global overview of biological processes modulated by the virus and that could be further explored to identify drug targets to address the pandemic. author/funder.

The reproductive number (R0) of the virus is currently thought to be around 3, suggesting the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission that appears to be through respiratory droplets and potentially a fecal-oral route [4] . In this pandemic situation, one of the outstanding questions concerns the possibility to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its persistence in the human population. Social distancing policy, lock-down and other containment measures have been worldwide implemented to slow down the spread. Current roadmaps to lifting the restrictions rely on the deployment of effective diagnostics, therapies, and eventually on the development of an effective vaccine.",

Most successful antiviral vaccines employ inactivated or attenuated whole viral particles as vaccine antigen and depend on the induction of neutralizing antibodies [5, 6] against structural proteins of the virus. However, virus yields from the dedicated cell culture systems could be relatively low compared to quantities envisioned to be required for massive vaccine production. In addition, the production campaigns are time-consuming and highly demanding due to the danger of working with these pathogens, and thus optimization of the production of whole viral particle antigen is of utmost interest for vaccines. Concomitantly with vaccine development, a better understanding of how the host responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection may help direct further therapeutic avenues.",

Sample preparation for mass spectrometry At each of various time points, SARS-CoV-2 -infected Vero cells were washed twice with 5 ml of PBS to remove media and FCS used to culture the cells. A volume of 1.5 ml of PBS was added to the washed cells before harvesting. The virus was inactivated and the cells lysed by autoclaving the samples at 125\u00b0C for 40 min. Proteins were precipitated by adding cold trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% (w/v). After an incubation of 5 min at 4 \u00b0C, the precipitated material was recovered by centrifugation at 16000 xg for 10 min.

In particular, out of the sixteen nonstructural proteins we identified peptides corresponding to the ORF1a papain-like protease (PLpro) / 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and to the accessory proteins encoded by ORF3a and ORF7a. These protein sequences were covered with 40 (N), 29 (S), 7 (M), 13 (ORF1ab), 4 (ORF3a), and 1 (ORF7a) distinct peptides. The sequence coverage of these polypeptides depends on their abundance, size, and lysine and arginine residues occurrence, the ORF7a protein with 121 residues being logically poorly detected compared to the others. Based on the sets of peptides shared by the different proteins, 2984 protein groups were identified, for which a total of 457,111 PSMs were assigned. The viral proteins represented 1.4% of these PSMs. The dynamics of viral protein levels across time points indicated that SARS-CoV-2 protein synthesis increased continuously after infection with a peak registered around day 3 post infection. Viral amplification was slightly delayed in cells infected at a MOI of 0.001 (Figure 2A). SARS-CoV-2 N, S, and M were consistently among the most abundant proteins detected. Their respective ratios were relatively constant along time. Decline in abundance of viral proteins registered at 7 days post infection",

            "text": "Next, we characterized changes in cellular protein networks upon SARS-CoV-2 infection at the level of total protein abundance. Dimension reduction by principal component analysis (PCA) showed that early and late time points were distinctively distributed along principal components 1 and 2, with replicates clustering closely. This was observed for both MOI. Interestingly, a degree of overlap was observed for time points J3 and J4 corresponding to the peak of viral protein abundance implying a smaller evolution of the host proteome between these time points (Figure 3A). Addition of the viral proteins measured at each time point did not affect samples separation. To elucidate the host response during virus amplification, we performed a co-expression cluster analysis to determine host proteins showing similar profiles over time (Figure 3B). Functional enrichment analysis performed on the members of each cluster provided a global overview of biological processes (Figure 4A-C). At MOI 0.01, clusters 2 and 5, with 345 and 198 detected protein members, respectively, showed a close similarity of the statistically enriched terms, with functions and pathways related to the viral life cycle among the most represented ones. Besides, as revealed by functional interaction network analysis even cluster-specific enriched functions like membrane trafficking and protein pre-processing in endoplasmatic reticulum and regulation of mRNA processing/splicing via spliceosome, respectively, were highly interconnected (Figure 4A-B). Also, an overlap of enriched biological functions was observed for clusters 3 and 6, with 16 and 10 representatives, respectively, characterized by a specific increase in the abundance of clustered proteins 3 days post-infection, with proteins involved in cornification and ECM regulators (Extra Cellular Matrix) among the top 20 significantly enriched terms (Figure 4A). Four distinct expression profiles were identified at MOI 0.001 (Figure 3B). Comparative analysis and inference of enriched biological pathways revealed a significant enrichment of functions related to host responses to the viral replication in cluster 2 and 3, with clathrin-mediated endocytosis (R-HSA-8856828) and vesicle-mediated transport (R-HSA-5653656) pathways specific of the former one (Figure 4D) and likely involved in vacuole formation and viral budding. Interestingly, similar to cluster 2 obtained at higher MOI, the expression profiles of the members of these clusters are similar to the dynamics of the viral protein levels across the kinetics. Clusters 4 (MOI 0.01) and 3 (MOI 0.001) in pathways and biological functions related to the host central metabolism with the metabolism of RNA and translation among the top enriched pathways. Despite the temporal expression profiles of the proteins belonging to these clusters are not characterised by major changes, their remodelling by the virus and a major effect on their abundance at earlier time points (<24 hours) cannot be excluded.",
