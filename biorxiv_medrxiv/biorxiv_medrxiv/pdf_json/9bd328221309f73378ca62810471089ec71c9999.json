Currently, several drugs such as remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, Ritonavir+Lopinavir, Arbidol and interferon are undergoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to test their efficacy and safety for the treatment of COVID-19 in many countries [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Among these investigating drugs remdesivir showed promising results [18] [19] . Remdesivir is nucleotide analog prodrug and shows broad spectrum antiviral activity against many RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2 [20] [21] . Remdesivir has been reported as a treatment of COVID-19 in United States, China and Italy [13, 15, 22] . while results are yet controversial [9] .
