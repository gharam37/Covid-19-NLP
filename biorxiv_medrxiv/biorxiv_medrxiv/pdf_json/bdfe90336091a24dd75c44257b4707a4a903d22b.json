In this report, we found that in the 43 COVID-19 patients with hypertension treated with ARBs/ACEIs before and after diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the concentrations of inflammatory CRP and procalcitonin were significantly lower compared with those treated with non-ARBs/ACEIs. ARBs/ACEIs treatment also resulted in a lower death rate and less critical cases in these patients. We did not find the concentrations of IL-6 in the ARBs/ACEIs group to be significantly different from that in the non-ARBs/ACEIs controls, which suggests that ARBs/ACEIs treatment alone might not be efficient in modulating the production of this cytokine.
