The most important thing is that the interlobular septal thickening and air trapping of the male group is more than that of the female group; In the elderly, the subpleural lesion, septal thickening, and pleural thickening increase much more than in the younger. CT is useful for clarifying the abnormality of the patient's lung and, especially, to describe the patterns and range of abnormality with coronavirus pneumonia [19] [20] [21] . In the current study, the predominance of GGOs and consolidation in the subpleural regions is remarkable. The GGOs and consolidation in such a distribution have been described as suggestive of a coronavirus 22,23 and other pneumonia patterns 24, 25 . However, they have different aspects. On CT images, centrilobular nodules, pseudocavitation, pneumatocele formation are commonly seen in H5N1 pneumonia 24 , but are not seen in NCP patients. During the disease, pleural effusions and cavitation can also be found in H5N1 pneumonia, but have not been developed in patients with NCP. In patients with severe rhinovirus pneumonia, bilateral patchy consolidation with multifocal GGO and septal thickening are noted 25 . Cavitation, pleural effusions, or lymphadenopathy are not characteristic manifestations of SARS pneumonia [26] , but 33.3% increases in lymph node enlargements are observed in patients with NCP. A few patients may see interlobular septal thickening and pleural effusions in MERS pneumonia 22 , and pneumothorax and pleural effusion are more common in patients who have died than in those who have recovered 27 . In NCP patients, we haven't seen pneumothorax, or pleural effusion, 40.4% interlobular septal thickening, 45.6% fibrosis, 45.6% vascular bundle thickening were often seen.
