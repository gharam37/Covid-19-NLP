Recently, the demand for laboratory reagents has greatly increased; in particular, there is a worldwide shortage of RNA extraction kits. Here, we describe a fast, simple and inexpensive method for the detection of SARS CoV-2 RNA, which includes a pretreatment with Proteinase K and a heating-cooling cycle before the amplification. This method bypasses the RNA extraction step; it leads to a higher amount of available viral RNA compared to the automated extraction methods, and generates the same profile in the subsequent amplification phase.",

Several NA automated analytical molecular systems are available, which, although having the advantage of obtaining a pure product of the highest quality, are expensive and greatly lengthen the analysis procedures. More importantly, recently the ability of manufacturers of reagents for molecular diagnostics to meet the increasing demand has progressively diminished. In particular, the main limitation is represented by the shortage of NA extraction kits. Since the demonstration of the virus in the samples is the only way to really indicate the patient' infectiveness, this shortage risks to greatly impair our ability to limit the spreading of the pandemic with tragic consequences. In addition, even when reagents are available, NA isolation represents a significant part of the analytical protocol; eliminating this step will increase the productivity of laboratories and decrease the cost of testing.",

Molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 2 is currently the best available approach for a correct diagnosis and to establish the infective potential of patients. RNA extraction from nasopharyngeal swabs of patients affected by COVID-19 has become a bottleneck in diagnostic procedures due to the enormous quantity of samples to be daily processed and to the shortage in extraction kit availability. In many instances, the shortage has induced the limitation of testing only to patients with symptoms (often non-specific) but in this way many asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic individuals 3,4 have not been tested and have become a major vehicle by which the infection has spread, first in China 5 and then in the rest of the World. To overcome this issue, we set up an in-house protocol to pretreat swab samples before performing RT-qPCR.",

Furthermore, since the automated diagnostic extraction system used in this study requires 200\u00b5L swab-derived material as template, while our method only needs 100\u00b5L of material, we were able to detect twice as much of the viral genome for each \u00b5L of sample.",
