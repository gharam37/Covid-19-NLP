            "text": "The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 and a pandemic on March 12, 2020. 1 Nations around the world are increasingly experiencing case clusters or community transmission. As of March 26, 2020, the United States had the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV2, of any country in the world. 2 Multiple areas in the US are seeing dramatic increases in cases of COVID-19 and concerns are mounting that local medical system response capacities will be quickly exceeded. Hospital critical care is perhaps the most important medical system choke point in terms of preventing deaths in a disaster scenario such as with the current COVID-19 pandemic. 3, 4 A spectrum of critical care, from intensive care units to other serviceable hospital critical care structures, can be drafted in the event of mass disasters, potentially doubling hospital capacity in a crisis care surge situation. 5, 6, 7, 8 However, whether the nation's potential hospital surge capacity is exactly double, or perhaps more or less than that, in the context of rapidly growing cases of COVID-19 in the US, remains unclear. We therefore brought together previously established disease modeling estimates 9 of the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US under various social distancing contact reduction assumptions, with local estimates of the potential critical care surge response 10 across all US counties. Our objectives in doing this was to highlight US counties that are at risk of exceeding their critical care surge capacity limits within one month, indicate the typical time it would take these counties to exceed their critical care surge capacity limits, and estimate the excess mortality that would potentially result from exceeding critical care surge capacity limits in these counties. These objectives speak to the capabilities of the US medical system under disaster conditions and the usefulness of social distancing and other prevention strategies for slowing the presentation rate of severe COVID-19 cases to a point where the US critical care system can adapt in minimizing preventable mortality. 11, 12 ",

Alaska and Hawaii were not included in this analysis as these states were disconnected in the commuting dataset that was used to project the transmission and spatio-temporal spread of COVID-19 cases (these two states will be added in later models and as part of ongoing calculations).",

To account for delays in infection confirmation, a time-to-event observation model using a Gamma distribution with a range of reporting delays and different maximum seeding was employed. Log-likelihood was used to identify the best fitting model-inference posterior. 8, 16 As in prior work 21 , the transmission of SARS-CoV2 under increasing reductions in population physical contact via control measures and behavior change was projected forward in time from March 24,2020 to April 24, 2020, using the optimized model parameter estimates. Control measures included travel restrictions between areas, self-quarantine and contact precautions that were publicly advocated or imposed, and greater availability of rapid testing for infection. Behavior changes in medical care-seeking due to increased awareness of COVID-19 and increased personal protective behavior (e.g., use of facemasks, social distancing, self-isolation when sick) were also considered. Three different contact reduction scenarios were projected, 0% (no contact reduction via controls and behavior change), 25% contact reduction, and 50% contact reduction.",

Broadly, these four scenarios assumed the baseline that 30% of a hospital's critical beds are unoccupied and available, that some currently occupied critical care beds can be cleared, that other specialized non-ICU beds can be redeployed as critical care beds, and, in the high scenario, that two critical care patients can be serviced using a single ventilator. In this way, existing critical care bed availability rates and occupied critical care bed clearance rates for purposes of meeting high-volume patient surges in disasters were incorporated into our estimates.",

A typical ICU length of stay for COVID-19 patients was used to calculate the daily discharge rate from hospital critical care beds to recalculate critical care bed need for each day of the study period. 32 Once a hospital's critical care bed capacity was reached, patients who could not be admitted -i.e., new critical care bed need minus critical care bed discharges -were aggregated to calculate excess deaths due to lack of critical care access. Prior reports of the hospital course of care for COVID-19 patients showed that the vast majority of those admitted to the ICU were critical and only one-in-five of those who were critical survived, mostly because of ICU care. Thus, the percentage of critically ill patients that should have gone to the ICU but did not and survived should be much lower, likely only 5%; we therefore assumed a 95% mortality for patients that would have been placed in a critical care bed but did not because their local critical care bed capacity had been exceeded. 33",

Urban counties were estimated to have greater numbers exceeding their critical care bed capacities within a month, from a maximum of 55 (4.7%) urban counties under the very low critical care surge response scenario with no contact reduction, to 6 (0.5%) urban counties under the high critical care surge response scenario with 50% contact reduction.

Moreover, roughly 4,000 to 11,000 excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care could be averted within the 4 week study period through aggressive critical care surge response and preparations, including high clearance of ICU and non-ICU critical care beds and extraordinary measures like using a single ventilator for multiple patients.

However, seven other major clusters of potentially preventable deaths due inadequate critical care access were estimated across the US.

However, a major limitation is that the models presented here use data on physical infrastructure but do not account for staffing or ventilator supplies. Healthcare workers, especially those involved in critical care, are at high risk for COVID-19 infection and thus there may be staffing shortages that reduce the utility of the critical care beds that could be gained under surge responses. There have already been reports of hospitals being unable to accept patients, not because of lack of beds but due to lack of staff to cover those beds. Some states, like New York, are currently recruiting retired healthcare workers to assist with staffing shortfalls, an approach that might be generally applicable in alleviating shortfalls during the current epidemic. These retirees are, however, generally older and can be particularly vulnerable to poor outcomes from COVID-19. Our models also cannot account for the innovation, ingenuity and perseverance of medical staff, many of whom are trained to work in crisis situations. It is likely that medical staff will find solutions that are unanticipated by our models, that can subsequently be included as they become known and more widely applied across healthcare systems. Future analyses should also incorporate counts of ventilators in addition to critical care beds. Our models also did not account for heterogeneities arising from specific high-risk communities in different localities. For instance, places with large elderly populations or high levels of pre-existing respiratory, cardiovascular, or immunocompromised conditions would have even higher mortality rates. Future analyses could also account for underlying population risk factors such as these.",
