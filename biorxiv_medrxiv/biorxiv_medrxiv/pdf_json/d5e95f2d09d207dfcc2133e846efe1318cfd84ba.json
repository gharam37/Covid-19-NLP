Moreover, the viral particles in kidneys were also investigated by transmission electronic microscope (EM). RESULTS 27.06% (23/85) patients exhibited acute renal failure (ARF). The eldery patients and cases with comorbidities such as hypertension and heart failure more easily developed ARF (65.22% vs 24.19%, p< 0.001; 69.57% vs 11.29%, p< 0.001, respectively).

[19] [20] [21] We report here that SARS-CoV-2 virus recruits high levels of CD68 + macrophages to infiltrate into the tubulointerstitium (Figure 4A) , suggesting that proinflammatory cytokines derived from macrophages would induce tubular damage. Both clinical and experimental models suggest that the abnormal presence of serum-derived complement components in the tubular lumen leads to the assembly of the complement C5b-9 (via the alternative pathway) on the apical brush border of tubular epithelial cells (TECs), and that this is an important factor in the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial damage. [22] [23] [24] We here observed that SARS-CoV-2 initiates complement C5b-9 assembly and deposition on tubules ( Figure 4B) .

The sections were then incubated in 3% BSA plus 0.1% H 2 O 2 for 1h at RT to block nonspecific binding. The sections were then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with primary anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocaspid protein (NP) antibodies (clone ID: 019, 1:100, rabbit IgG; Sino Biological, Beijing), anti-CD8 (Clone ID:4B11, 1:100, mouse IgG2b; BIO-RAD), anti-CD68 (Clone ID:KP1, 1:100, mouse IgG1; BIO-RAD), anti-CD56 (Clone ID:123C3, 1:100, mouse IgG1; BIO-RAD), anti-C5b-9 (clone ID: aE11, 1:100, mouse IgG; Dakocytomation) or rabbit-isotype antibody controls (1:100; Dako). Sections were further incubated with the HRP-anti-Rabbit secondary antibodies for 1h at RT. Peroxidase activity was visualized with the DAB Elite kit (K3465, DAKO), and the brown coloration of tissues represented positive staining as viewed by a light microscope (Zeiss Axioplan 2, Germany).
