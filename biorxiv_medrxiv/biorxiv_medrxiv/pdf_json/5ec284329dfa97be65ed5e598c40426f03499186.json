In this paper, we propose a Susceptible-Infected-Exposed-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) differential model [Weitz J. S. and Dushoff J., Scientific reports, 2015] for the analysis and forecast of the COVID-19 spread in Italian regions, using the data from the Italian Protezione Civile from February 24th 2020. In this study, we investigate an adaptation of SEIRD that takes into account the actual policies of the Italian government, consisting of modelling the infection rate as a time-dependent function (SEIRD(rm)). Preliminary results on Lombardia and Emilia-Romagna regions confirm that SEIRD(rm) fits the data more accurately than the original SEIRD model with constant rate infection parameter. Moreover, the increased flexibility in the choice of the infection rate function makes it possible to better control the predictions due to the lockdown policy. 12 the outbreak containment. 13 We consider here deterministic compartmental models, based on a system of initial 14 value problems of Ordinary Differential Equations. This theory has been studied since 15 the beginning of the century by W.O. Kermack and A. G. MacKendrick [3] who 16 proposed the basic Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. The SIR model and its 17 later modifications, such as Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) [4] were later 18 introduced in the study of outbreaks diffusion. These models split the population into 19",

Many 3 researchers are making efforts for proposing new refined models to analyse the present 4 situation and predict possible future scenarios. 5 With this paper, we hope to contribute to the ongoing research on this topic and to 6 give a practical instrument for a deeper comprehension of the virus spreading features 7 and behaviour. 8 The modelling of infectious diseases is currently performed by Ordinary Differential 9 Equations (ODEs) deterministic compartmental models [1] or by stochastic 10 procedures [2] . The tuning of the parameters of the equations allows better modelling of 11 environmental features, such as social restrictions or changes of political strategies in groups, compartments, and reproduce their behaviour by formalising their reciprocal 20 interactions. For example, the SIR model groups are Susceptible who can catch the 21 disease, Infected who have the disease and can spread it, and Removed those who have 22 either had the disease or are recovered, immune or isolated until recovery. The SEIR 23 model proposed by Chowell et al. [5] also considers the Exposed group: containing 24 individuals who are in the incubation period. 25 The evolution of the Infected group depends on a critical parameter, usually denoted 26 as R0, representing the basic reproductive rate and it measures of how transferable a 27 disease is. This quantity determines whether the infection will spread exponentially, die 28 out, or remain constant. When R 0 > 1 the epidemic is spreading. The value of R0 can 29 be inferred, for example, by epidemic studies or by statistical data from literature or it 30 can be calibrated from the available data. In this paper, we use the available data for 31 determining the value of R0. 32 Compared to previous outbreaks, such as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV [6] , when the Analogously, in the Italian case, to limit the virus diffusion all over the Italian area, 40 the government has started to impose more and more severe restrictions since March 41 10th 2020. Hopefully, these measures affect the spread of the COVID-19 virus, reducing 42 the number of infected people and the value of the parameter R0.",

Concerning the Italian situation, the outbreak started in 46 Lombardia on February 21st, and it is still affecting more and more regions. In the 47 beginning, severe lockdown measures were imposed in very restricted areas and only 48 after March 10th uniform restrictions were imposed all over the country. 49 We believe that a more flexible, time-dependent parameter related to the infection 50 rate, not only could it give a better fit of the measured data, but it also allows us to 51 represent possible future scenarios caused by different policies of the Italian 52 Government. In this paper, we propose to represent the infection rate as a piecewise 53 time-dependent function, which reflects the changes in external conditions. The 54 parameter R0, which is proportional to the infection rate, becomes a time-dependent 55 parameter R t and it follows a different trend each time the external conditions change, 56 depending on the particular situation occurring in that period. For example, the 57 application of new restrictions to the population movements at time t 0 should hopefully 58 cause a decrease of R t when t > t 0 .",
