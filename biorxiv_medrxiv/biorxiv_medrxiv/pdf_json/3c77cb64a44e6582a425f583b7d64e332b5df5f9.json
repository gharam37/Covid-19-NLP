Literature search revealed that there is very little formal evidence on the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant, labouring and postnatal women or their babies. The clinical evidence to date suggests that pregnant and childbearing women, and their babies are not at increased risk of either getting infected, or of having severe symptoms or consequences than the population as a whole. There is no evidence on the short-and longer-term psychological impacts of restrictive practices or social and personal constraints for childbearing women during COVID-19 in particular, or infection pandemics in general. The potential for adverse mental health consequences of the pandemic should be recognised as a critical public health concern, together with appropriate care and support to prevent and ameliorate any negative impacts.",

            "text": "Being pregnant and/or having a baby is, ideally, an event that is associated with joy, delight, and fulfilment, following a safe and positive pregnancy, birth, and early parenthood. However, some women and their partners can experience a range of negative emotions during this period, including anxiety and depression. Globally, the extent and adverse impacts of maternal mental health problems are increasingly recognised. As the World Health Organisation (WHO) states \"virtually all women can develop mental disorders during pregnancy and in the first year after delivery\". Conditions such as extreme stress, emergency and conflict situations and natural disasters can increase risks for specific mental health disorders [1] . Maternal and parental mental health problems are associated with longer term risks for the mother and partner, and for their children [2] [3] [4] [5] . This raises the question: how are we safeguarding the short-and longer-term mental health of pregnant women and their partners in the age of coronavirus? Apart from the overall population level pandemic-related stress, there is still a limited formal evidence-base about the nature and clinical consequences of the various versions of coronavirus (COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 or HCoV-19) for a pregnant woman. There is even less information about the mental health impacts consequent to self-isolation, living in a household with an affected person, limited access to goods/services and to routine or emergency health and social care. For women (and especially for those living in poverty, in poor or cramped housing), these issues may be exacerbated if they are expected to be the main carers for elderly or infirm relatives, or for young children, while living with multiple family members in confined spaces.",

However, the guidelines from WHO for mothers infected with COVID-19 are \"Close contact and early, exclusive breastfeeding helps a baby to thrive\", \"Hold your newborn skin-to-skin\" and \"share a room with your baby\" [16] . In addition, UNICEF recommendations during the period of the outbreak are \"Regardless of feeding method, it is essential that sick and preterm babies' profound need for emotional attachment with their parents/primary caregiver continues to be considered. Keeping mothers and babies together wherever possible and responding to the baby's need for love and comfort will not only enable breastmilk/breastfeeding, but will also protect the baby's short-and long-term health, wellbeing and development. In addition, this will support the mother's mental wellbeing in the postnatal period\" [17] .",

Given the potential for postnatal transmission indicated by the single case of neonatal infection noted above, WHO adds that women who are breastfeeding, and, indeed, those who are giving babies formula milk, should \"practice respiratory hygiene during feeding, wearing a mask where available, wash hands before and after touching the baby and routinely clean and disinfect surfaces they have touched\" [16] . 5 .

Although the overall incidence of severe disease was highest in the under one year old group (10.6%) this was still much lower than in adult patients (18.5%) suggesting that babies and children are much less at risk of adverse effects of being infected with COVID-19 and much less likely to die as a result than adults.

It is especially important when two of the Millennium Development Goals (4 and 5) emphasise on maternal and child health, stating that overall health cannot be achieved without mental health [2] . Psychosocial stress, particularly during early pregnancy, has been identified as a key risk factor in the aetiology of a preterm birth [19] . The potential (ill-informed) practices of separating mothers from their infants post birth in the name of protection from COVID-19 infection, such as witnessed in China, and a lack of certainty leading to early cessation of breastfeeding, have harmful impacts on maternal mental health via 'toxic stress' [20] and perceptions of self-blame and shame [21] . The links between social isolation and depression are well reported [22] , and potentially magnified when coupled with juggling the demands of confined family members. A recent article titled The Coronavirus Is a Disaster for Feminism also highlights how women's independence is the 'silent victim' of the pandemic due to women being more likely than males to take responsibility for caregiving activities [23] . This situation is even more acute for women who face complex life issues such as poverty, or domestic violence. Women may be exposed to an increased risk of domestic .

While there are a very few cases in which maternal to infant transmission may have occurred in utero this evidence is not definitive. Policies that are put in place to restrict maternal choices and rights in the name of protection of mother and/or baby are therefore not justified based on current evidence, and are likely to be associated with longer term harms, both physical and psychological. Services should not enforce unnecessary practices in the name of protection, including separation of mother and baby, or of chosen pain relief methods, and recommendations not to breastfeed should be actively avoided.",
