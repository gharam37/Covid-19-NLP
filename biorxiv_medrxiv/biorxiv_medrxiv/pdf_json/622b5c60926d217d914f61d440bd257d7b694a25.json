This challenge led to the concept of splitting ventilator between several patients, which aroused interest as well as a strong opposition from multiple professional societies (The joint statement) 1 .Establishment of a safe ventilator splitting setup which enables monitoring and control of each ventilated patient would be a desirable ability. Achieving independency between the Co-vent patients would enable effective coping with different individual clinical scenarios and broaden the pairing possibilities of patients connected to a single ventilator. We conducted an experiment to determine if our designed setup achieves these goals.",

Adding readily available pressure sensors (transducers), PEEP valves, flow control valves, one-way (check) valves and HME filters made the circuit safe enough and suitable for our goals. We first examined a single lung simulator establishing the baseline set parameters, while monitoring ventilator measures as Tidal Volume. The initial ventilator setting we chose was a controlled mandatory ventilation mode with a PIP (peak inspiratory pressure) of 25cmH2O, PEEP (Positive End Expiratory Pressure) of 5 cmH2O. In pressure control set at 20 cmH2O, the recorded mean TV( tidal volume) was 1000 mL (approximately 500 mL/lung simulator) with an average MV(minute ventilation) of 13 L/min (or 6.5 L/min/lung simulator). After examining the system with the dual modified circuits attached, and obtaining all the ventilation parameters, we simulated several clinical scenarios. We simulated clinical events such as: partial or full obstruction, disconnection, air leak and compliance differentials, which occur frequently on a ventilation course. Thus, it is a paramount system demand to keep undisturbed ventilation to the Co-vent patient A, while being challenged by patient B.",

This experiment demonstrates the ability of the split ventilator to ventilate dual lung simulators with increased safety, monitoring and ventilation pressures control of each simulated patient. This split ventilator kept supporting a simulated patient with undisturbed parameters while the CO-vent patient was simulated to be disconnected, having an air leak, or exhibiting lung compliance deterioration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a split ventilator setup demonstrates these capabilities. Our pilot experiment suggests a significant potential of expanding the ventilator support resources, and is especially relevant during COVID-19 outbreak. Since this setup has not been used in a clinical setting yet, further research should be conducted to explore the safety limits and the capabilities of this model.",

A possible crisis standard of care strategy is the ventilation of two patients with a single mechanical ventilator. As pointed out by the \"Joint statement\" 1 , Co-venting strategy should only be considered as an absolute last resort 1 . The first descriptions of Co-venting multiple patients on a single ventilator were advanced by Neyman 2 and Paladino 3 . The use of Co-Venting has been tested in controlled, experimental models using test lungs, animals or human volunteers for brief periods [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Lately New York State Department of Health approved the ventilator splitting to treat dual patients with one machine 13 . We conducted a study to determine if our setup can yield safe ventilation, monitoring, and control for each connected patient. We also challenged our setup with clinical scenarios that resemble common events on a ventilation course, assuring that no deleterious interactions between simulated patient's circuits can occur. Our work consists of an experimental setup with pressure recording and a computational flow simulation model which describes the flow rates and different pressures throughout the system. The numerical model and pressure recordings enable a strong understanding of the system's behavior in different scenarios which helps us shorten development times and approval processes.",

Using mandatory pressure-cycled ventilation can overcome most of the reservations raised by the Joint statement 1 . This may allow splitting the ventilator in a reasonably safe manner, while limiting and control the driving pressure which suits a lung-protective strategy 7 . Using Volume Control mode for Co-venting provides no control over the TV or the maximal airway pressure of any patient. Thus on Volume Control ventilation, doubled TV may be delivered to an individual patient when his Co-Vent partner's tube gets kinked, or obstructed. Patients sharing the ventilator on PC mode don't have to match in compliance or by their size, as opposed to VC mode where the recommended TV is 6-8 mL/kg. The alarms setting were selected to mitigate risk to either patient and to identify any possible obstacles in the ventilation course right on occurrence. The sensitivity threshold was raised, to ensure no patient's stimuli would occur, following our demand of no dependency between the patients.",

Although the safe and reliable ventilation method is using one ventilator for one patient, in mass crisis setting Co-venting may be a viable option. Co-Venting has been tested only in controlled, experimental models using test lungs or animals for brief periods 4 . Thus the use of Co-Venting should only be considered in a crisis situation. In this experiment we demonstrated that it is possible and considerably safer to simultaneously ventilate dual lung simulators, as simulated patients, using the split ventilator setup. This setup enables monitoring and ventilation parameters control of each simulated patient, with no possible deleterious interactions between simulated patient's circuits. The relative independency of Co-venting patients is feasible due to the installed components of the circuit. The check one-way valves were crucial in this process, as the pressure transducers, the PEEP valves and the flow control valves. This experiment, successfully addresses the concerns of the \"joint statement\".At the second part of our experiment we simulated several common clinical events on a ventilation course which challenge the used ventilator on a daily basis. The setup we manufactured proved to provide the safety and ventilating capabilities we were aiming for. The split ventilator succeeded in supporting each simulated patient in balanced ventilation distribution with no disturbances while being challenged with clinical events of Co-vent patient. The ventilation of the attached simulated patients is not affected by other individuals' deterioration, obstructed tube, air leak, or disconnection. This setup was able to identify and manage the complexity of the Co-venting patients. We used a standard ventilator for installing this setup, combined with readily, available components with no electronics or software, so it is easy to understand, implement and operate.",

Still, the split ventilator exhibits reasonable safety, while monitoring and controlling each individual circuit parameters. It is also possible to measure each patient TV by using the flow sensors, already installed in our system, unfortunately we did not include these in this experiment. Despite the ability of our setup to monitor and control ventilator settings in differential lung compliances, it may not be achievable in every extreme situation. The infection control implications of Co-Venting are not firmly established. We used standard antimicrobial filters (HME) in each individual circuit limb. But further research is needed to fully evaluate the risk of cross contamination. The CDC states that the risk of Co-venting \"with the above infection controlled interventions is likely to be small and would likely be appropriate in a crisis standard of care\". The split ventilator is safe only in Pressure Control Mode. Patients should not be able to trigger nor affect the ventilation of their Co-vent partners. We recommend increasing the sensitivity trigger threshold, sedating the patients and, as a last resort, paralyzing them. Auto-PEEP, increased dead space and resulted hypercapnea could be anticipated due to the increased length of the circuit. Since we can accept hypercapnea, as measures of lung protective strategy, we believe it should not be an obstacle for implementing our setup. All the Co-venting patients on the split ventilator would share parameters as RR, I: E, and FiO2.Co-venting patients on this setup could be considered only if all other alternatives are exhausted. Developing separate screen monitoring and control panel for each patient, would make this split ventilator even simpler and more user friendly operation. This setup is not compatible with every patient. Patients who suffer from baseline diseases as severe Asthma or COPD exacerbation should be precluded from Co-venting.",
