The ability to allow patients to self-collect confers a number of 160 benefits to both patient, provider, and system. First, patients are likely to tolerate the alternate161 collections locations of MT, anterior nares or tongue over NP. NP sampling can cause coughing 162 and sneezing which may be uncomfortable to the patient and increase the risk of aerosol 163 transmission of SARS-CoV2 transmission to health care workers. A patient-collected sample 164 reduces personal protective equipment use, which is currently in short supply. When patients 165 collect their own samples, health care workers can focus on other patients or other parts of the 166 clinical encounter, increasing practice efficiency though optimizing staff utilization. 167 Other respiratory illnesses have leveraged self-collected samples from locations other than NP. 168 MT collection using a nylon, flocculated swab were found to be equivalent to nurse collected in 169 one study 17 , while self-collected MT swabs were found to be a reliable alternative to health 170 worker collection for influenza A and B virus RT-PCR analysis in another study 18 . Similarly, 171 saliva collected from the tongue has also held promise. In a two-phase study, tongue swabs (two 172 per subject) exhibited a combined sensitivity of 92.8% relative to sputum for tuberculosis 173 detection in adults 12 , and exhibited promise as non-invasive samples for diagnosis of pediatric 174 tuberculosis 13 . 175 This study has a number of limitations. Samples were collected in five urgent care clinics 176 located in a single region of the US. Our analysis was cross-sectional and limited to single 177 comparisons to NP. With additional analysis and longitudinal data collection, we hope to 178 understand how self-collection of samples from multiple upper respiratory anatomical sites 179 contribute to test performance.",
