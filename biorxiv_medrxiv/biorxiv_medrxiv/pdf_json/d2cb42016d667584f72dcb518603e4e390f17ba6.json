Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling, we trained a topic model from the corpus, analyzed the semantic relationships between topics and compared the topic distribution between COVID-19 and other CoV infections. Results: Eight topics emerged overall: clinical characterization, pathogenesis research, therapeutics research, epidemiological study, virus transmission, vaccines research, virus diagnostics, and viral genomics. It was observed that current COVID-19 research puts more emphasis on clinical characterization, epidemiological study, and virus transmission. In contrast, topics about diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, genomics and pathogenesis only account for less than 10% or even 4% of all the COVID-19 publications, much lower than those of other CoV infections. Conclusions: These results identified knowledge gaps in the area of COVID-19 and offered directions for future research.",

LDA assumes individual document as random mixtures over latent topics, with topics in turn being probability distributions over multiple vocabularies, and topics being uncorrelated. The Gibbs sampling algorithm is used to estimate the topic distribution parameters of the document and the multi-distribution of the vocabulary on each topic. The evaluation index in the statistical language model, coherence score, was used to find the optimal number of topics in the corpus. The coherence score is calculated by the co-occurrence frequency of the words in the sliding window, which increases with the increase of sentence similarity, meaning the higher, the better. Although the coherence score can help to decide the most appropriate topic number, such number sometimes can be still large for manually understanding. Under this circumstance, manual examination should be performed to evaluate models with different numbers of topics with the aid of expert knowledge to thoroughly understand the corpus. For each model, 15 top words per topic were examined to assess scientific coherence of the words as a set, overlap in topic words across topics, and human understandability. The selected model was used for all subsequent analyses.",

The social science research community should act to assess the impact of a major public health crisis like COVID-19 on the complex network of modern societies (23, 24) . This present work has several limitations that must be acknowledged to apprehend the findings. First, as a computer model, topic modeling has difficulties with understanding nuances and subtext. We identified eight major topics with frequent appearances, whereas some specific topics such as virus natural history and human-animal interface were buried due to low proportions. Future work will attempt to develop an approach to detect and visualize the conceptual sub-domains. Second, it is also necessary to be aware that the granularity of terms used to label topics may vary a little for different topics. We have tried our best to keep them at the same level through carefully curating the top words in each topic, as well as reviewing text intention of the corresponding publications.

We conducted a topic-based bibliometric study to address two questions \"What is the CoVs research interested in?\" and \"Where are we with our research about COVID-19?\". An LDA-based model was used to identify the hotspots and their difference between COVID-19 and other CoV infections in a quantitative way. Generally, eight main research areas are identified, i.e., clinical characterization, pathogenesis research, therapeutics research, epidemiological study, virus transmission, vaccines research, virus diagnostics, and viral genomics. The results also indicate that studies in diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, viral genomics, and pathogenesis are urgently needed to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. As COVID-19 can be considered a recent emerged disease, we characterize a 'snapshot' of this field at an early stage in its development. Our findings can potentially aid governments and the research community in understanding recent development of the research field, optimizing research topic decision, and monitoring new scientific or technological activities. .

This seems reasonable and suggests that these three topics can provide each other with a wealth of information. The topic 'epidemiological study' shares close relationships with 'clinical characterization' because clinical characterization investigation is an important part of epidemiology. Meanwhile, close relationships also exist between 'epidemiological study' and 'therapeutics research' or 'virus transmission', probably due to the importance of epidemiology in the therapeutics discovery and virus transmission blocking.

Research hotspots in our results do show similarities with the selected knowledge gaps in \"A COORDINATED GLOBAL RESEARCH ROADMAP: 2019 NOVEL CORONAVIRUS\" published by the WHO (8), which is consensus of over 400 experts from across the world. Six of our eight distinct topics ('clinical characterization', 'therapeutics research', 'epidemiological study', 'virus transmission', 'virus diagnostics' and 'vaccines research') were listed as research priorities in the roadmap. This suggests that our topic modeling successfully captured the hotspots of CoV research, thus giving us a chance to quantify how much has been investigated about COVID-19.

The epidemiological study plays a key role in the blockage of virus transmission. The study of viral genomics is relatively isolated, but it is important to identify pathogens and their variants at an early stage of virus outbreak. In response to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, scientists in China immediately started to research the source of the new coronavirus, and rapidly published the first genome of SARS-CoV-2 on 10 January 2020, which greatly promoted virus diagnostics and epidemiological research (25). By highlighting such theme interactions within coronavirus research, we hope to inspire new collaborations among researchers, by sharing data, information, technologies and ideas.
