Unchecked, with a basic reproduction rate (R0) estimated at between 2 and 3 (Ferguson et al, 2020 and an estimated 4.4% of those infected requiring hospitalisation (Ferguson et al, 2020) , the virus can propagate rapidly through a population , leading to peaks in demand for hospital care which are simply not possible to match with existing or otherwise available capacity (Ferguson et al, 2020 , Instituto Superiore Di Sanita, 2020 . If, at such times, patients are unable to access the bedded care required then otherwise-avoidable death is likely to result (White & Lo, 2020) . The likelihood of this is particularly heightened when intensive care beds are required, since the necessary invasive ventilation and organ support cannot readily or safely be delivered in other settings (\u00d1amendys-Silva, 2020) . Early case fatality rates from Wuhan would not be expected to appreciate these capacitydependent deaths (i.e. deaths that can be attributed to a patient unable to access the care they need due to lack of available capacity), since drastic efforts were taken by authorities to avoid health services becoming overwhelmed, in enforcing restrictions on movement and rapidly upscaling capacity through the building of two new hospitals (Khan et al, 2020) . Without improved treatment options, there is little that can be done to reduce COVID-19 deaths occurring when the patient has otherwise been cared for in the most appropriate hospital setting, and so planners should focus on keeping to a minimum the capacity-dependent deaths that are within their influence. That is, efforts should be made to ensure the right level of care is available to patients at the right time.",

On the demand side, in absence of the means to treat or prevent disease, the slowing down of cases requiring hospitalisation using measures such as school closures and social distancing can reduce peak excess demand, the so-called \"flattening the curve\" (Anderson et al, 2020) . On the supply side, efforts to expand the capacity of medical and ventilated beds can increase the effective operating throughput, meaning more COVID-19 patients could be admitted and fewer would be rejected with either no care or care in a sub-optimal setting, resulting in increased chance of death.",

Public health authorities need to know what effect their policies on social distancing, home isolation and school closures (i.e. policies to reduce the effective R0) can have on decreasing or changing the shape over time of demand and, in turn, capacity-dependent deaths. Healthcare service planners and managers need to be cognisant of the likely benefits of their options around the flexing of bedded capacity, especially regarding the allocation between acute and intensive care beds (where the substantial efforts involved in increasing the latter must be well justified). With an appropriate model and accompanying software tool, the effect of these scenarios can be projected and used to make better informed strategic decisions when planning the response to a COVID-19 pandemic.",

However, to the best of the authors' knowledge there has been no explicit modelling of capacity-dependent deaths based on predicted demand. While Ferguson et al (2020) provide a detailed model of demand and the resulting deaths under various mitigation strategies, their work assumes a fixed mortality rate that is not dependent on the available capacity of the healthcare system. The modelling in this paper addresses this limitation by predicting the excess mortality resulting from demand exceeding intensive care capacity under several mitigation scenarios.",

This is especially true for the stochastic, discrete-event approach to simulation, as it is particularly suited to situations where entities (e.g. patients) \"compete\" for limited resources such as hospital beds and operating room time (Pitt et al, 2016) . Many simulation studies that have tackled questions around demand and capacity in healthcare, both under typical health system conditions (for example Bagust et al, 1999 , Demir et al, 2015 and in periods of increased pressure such as mass casualty events (Glasgow et al, 2018) and winter bed crises (Vasilakis & El-Darzi, 2001 , Wood, 2019 . Specifically in the context of intensive care, simulation studies have addressed bed requirements by using the system dynamics simulation approach to evaluate different management policies (Mahmoudian-Dehkrodi & Sadat, 2016) , and applying analytical queuing models and simulations to the management of patient flow (Kim et al, 1999 , Griffiths et al, 2010 . This paper reports on the development and application of a purpose-built computer simulation model and accompanying easy-to-use open source software, designed for evaluating scenarios to mitigate capacity-dependent deaths from a COVID-19 (or other) pandemic. It should be noted that capacityindependent deaths, occurring when patients are cared for in the most appropriate setting, are out of scope of this study. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Development of the model and implementation is covered in Section 2 alongside data requirements for model parameterisation and the scenarios considered for experimenting with the model. Illustrative results, on application to an intensive care unit in a large teaching hospital in England, are presented in Section 3. Finally, Section 4 contains a discussion on limitations, practical application, and further uses of the model and tool.",

In Kendall's notation (Kendall, 1953) this is an ( ) | | | queuing system: that is, in turn, a time-inhomogeneous Poisson arrivals process representing the epidemic curve for cases requiring hospitalisation; a general service distribution approximating patient length of stay in hospital; C service channels; and a total system capacity of C patients, i.e. no space for waiting. For rejected admissions (lost arrivals), death occurs with probability and survival with probability 1 \u2212 . The model can be applied in the context of general acute beds or intensive care beds, assuming the parameters are calibrated accordingly. Implementation of this model is through the iterative three-phased method of discrete event simulation (Pidd, 1998) . In the case of this study, the types of simulation event consist of: a. Arrival of patient requiring hospital admission (unconditional event) b. Patient admitted (conditional event) c. Patient discharged (unconditional event) d. Patient admission rejected and patient died (conditional event) e. Patient admission rejected and patient survived (conditional event)",

This is according to two scenarios, as presented in Ferguson et al (2020) . The first is effectively a \"do nothing\" involving no restrictions on movement, while the second involves \"case isolation, home quarantine, and social distancing of those over 70\" (Figure 1 ). Informed by publication of this report on 16 th March 2020, the UK Government implemented restrictions on movement equivalent to this latter strategy, effective as of 20 th March 2020. At the hospital there are typically 45 beds available for patients requiring intensive care (21 general and 24 cardiac). In the first instance, plans are in place for capacity to be increased to a maximum of 76 beds, through making use of operating theatres and other specialist bays (which have become available due to the cancellation of routine surgery). There remains some potential to increase this number further, should additional surge capacity be required (this is considered within the scenario analysis of Section 3).",

Employing these measures reduces total deaths by an estimated 57% and cuts the peak daily deaths by more than two-thirds ceteris paribus (Scenario 2). Increasing capacity from 45 to 76 intensive care beds (Scenario 3) further reduces total deaths by 14%, with an effect starting to show on the number of subsequent days at maximum capacity (reducing from 68 to 62). This is brought down further (to 57 days) should capacity increases to 100 beds be possible (Scenario 4), which also brings down total deaths to under 2000. Reducing mean length of stay by onequarter appears to have a relatively small improvement to the total number of deaths (Scenario 5 c.f. Scenario 2), which is in part due to the right-skewed nature of the length of stay distribution (i.e. the number of longer-staying patients in the tail is unchanged since the shape of the distribution is presumed unaltered).",

Scenario 2). However, without increases to capacity this simply spreads the deaths over a longer period of time, rather than reducing the total by a significant amount (2296 c.f. 2521). To achieve a significant reduction in total deaths then any \"flattening\" of demand must be accompanied by increases in capacity. If this can be accomplished, alongside the afore-mentioned reductions in length of stay, then such synergy becomes evident, cutting total capacity-dependent deaths to just over 1000, reducing the peak per day to 22, and shortening the continuous time operating at full capacity.",

Results have been useful in highlighting the need for additional intensive care beds, where decision-makers must now weigh-up the benefits of converting more beds for such purpose against the opportunity cost of such actions (e.g. if theatre space is used then this may limit the ability to perform emergency surgery). Simulation results have also been useful in understanding workforce implications (through measures relating to estimated continual time at maximum occupancy) and the planning of mortuary capacity (through understanding peak daily deaths). While the number of deaths reported in this modelling study may appear to be large against the estimated 353,862 catchment area of the hospital, they should be viewed in the context of other projections. For example, the agestratified case fatality rates of Verity et al, 2020 produce an estimated 4,349 deaths when no effort is made to explicitly model capacity-dependence in the numbers of deaths.",

There is the assumption that death occurs immediately if a bed in the required setting is not available. Realistically death will not be immediate (World Health Organization, 2020 ), yet at this early stage of the pandemic there exist no reliable data to capture this parameter in the model in a meaningful way. This has no effect on the ultimate number of deaths estimated, but will affect their specific timing and the thus, the peak daily number. This should therefore be considered if seeking validation against actual number deaths over time (i.e. it should be expected that there will be a lag). It should also be acknowledged that the model does not mechanistically capture delays to discharge or transfer, which are commonplace in hospital patient flow (Landeiro et al, 2019 ). An example for the application considered here would be the inability to discharge a patient from intensive care due to the lack of an available acute bed. While this has not been modelled (this would be possible at the cost of additional complexity, see Wood & Murch, 2019) , the effects can be understood by adjusting the length of stay distribution used within the simulation according to estimated or hypothetical delay times. Finally, it is assumed in this study that all intensive care beds are available for newly-arriving COVID-19 patients. While elective procedures requiring post-operative intensive care have been cancelled, there remains other sources of non-elective non-COVID-19 intensive care demand. Estimations of this, once the effect of societal isolation becomes appreciable (e.g. any reduced road traffic accidents, alcohol-related injuries), can be incorporated within the model parameter for capacity simply by deducting the average beds occupied by such patients.",

Given efforts to promote user-friendliness of the tool (by way of execution through a simple purpose-built function in R), any such changes to input parameter values can be readily addressed by running a small number of additional simulation runs (thus helping to ensure results remain in line with the latest data and forecasts). For the intensive care application considered here, the tool may also be used at a later stage of the pandemic in order to understand when elective cardiac surgery may safely resume following any projected reduction in COVID-19 intensive care occupancy. Further development of the model may also unlock the ability to assess the implication of different intensive care admission criteria on aggregate measures of mortality (as suggested in Utley et al, 2011 and White & Lo, 2020) . In such case the model may be used to understand the effects of rejecting intensive care admissions from patients of cohorts known to have negligible survival likelihood, in the interests of maintaining available beds for those known to have more favourable chances.",
