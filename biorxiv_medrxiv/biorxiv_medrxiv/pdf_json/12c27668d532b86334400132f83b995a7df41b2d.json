Based on the urgent need for high-throughput COVID-19 screening, we tested the performance of three alternative, simple and affordable protocols to rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2, overcoming the long and tedious RNA extraction step. Although with an average increase of 6.1 (\u00b1 1.6) cycles compared to standard tests with RNA extracts, we show that RT-qPCR yielded consistent results in nasopharyngeal swab samples that were subject to a direct 70 o C incubation for 10 min. Our findings provide viable options to overcome any supply chain issue and help to increase the throughput of diagnostic tests by using any qPCR device, thereby complementing standard COVID-19 testing.",

The current standard assay for diagnosis is based on the extraction of RNA from respiratory samples, especially from nasopharyngeal swab viral transport media (VTM), and subsequent one-step reverse transcription and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) targeting one or several sequences from SARS-CoV-2 (Corman et al., 2020) . However, this standard procedure usually takes 3.5-4.0 h considering the manual interventions and there is a risk of reagent shortage in major kit suppliers, particularly for the RNA extraction step. Besides, the common hospital practice relies on liquid-handling robots for RNA extractions that adds another bottleneck nowadays given the large number of populations being screened.",

Diagnosis of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 infection was conducted with 200 \u03bcL of VTM with standard RNA extractions, which used the MagCore viral Nucleic Acid Extraction kit (RBC Bioscience) in a MagCore liquid handler (RBC Bioscience) (lasting approximately 1 h) or the Nuclisens easyMAG kit (bioM\u00e9rieux) with the eMAG liquid handler (bioM\u00e9rieux) (lasting approximately 1 h and 20 min), and a one-step RT-qPCR using the LightMix\u00ae Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene kit (Roche). This commercial mix was supplemented with primers and probes for detecting the human actin (ACTB) gene expression to serve as an internal control of the reaction as described elsewhere (Fenollar et al., 2016) (Table  1) . The experiments included a non-template control and a positive control for the E-gene amplification (LightMix\u00ae kit Sarbecovirus ivRNA control +, Roche). The RT-qPCR was performed in 10 \u03bcL final volume reactions (5 \u03bcL of sample) using a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Following the specifications, thermal cycling was performed at 55 o C for 5 min for the RT step, followed by an amplification step with initial denaturation at 95 o C for 5 min and 45 cycles of 95 o C for 5 sec, 60 o C for 15 sec, and 72 o C for 15 sec. A final cooling step at 40 o C for 30 sec was also included. Thermal cycling took 1 h and 14 min in total.",

Similarly, the positive control for the E-gene amplification yielded positive results in the RT-qPCR experiments of the three alternative sample treatment protocols. The use of specific and highly sensitive probes for coronavirus E-gene amplification leads to optimal results, therefore, the rationale for the first tests design has been followed in our assays (Corman et al., 2020) . Of note, this envelope small membrane protein (E) is required to produce a structurally complete viral particle together with three other major structural proteins: the spike (S), the nucleocapsid (N) and the membrane (M) proteins (Mortola and Roy 2004; Masters 2006; Wang 2017) . All samples gave positive results for the internal human ACTB. Ct for the E-gene amplification in the standard RNA extractions indicated that two of the positive COVID-19 cases had low Ct (<20) while the other two had large values (Ct>28) ( Table 2) .",

Therefore, we considered these five samples as false negatives, corresponding to a false negative rate in the Direct treatment of 12% (95% confidence interval [CI]= 5-28). Considering the 36 samples that were COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 positive by the two methods, there was an average increase in the E-gene Ct by the Direct method of 6.1 (\u00b1 1.6) compared to that obtained by a regular RNA extraction. None of the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 negative VTM samples was classified as a positive by the Direct treatment. Therefore, the Direct method yielded a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 87.8% (95% CI= 73.8-95.9), 100% (95% CI=92.8-100), and 99.9% (95% CI= 95.7-100), respectively.",

We warn that while we observed amplification of other SARS-CoV2 target alternatives of the same kit on samples tested using the Direct method (i.e., the LightMix\u00ae Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV N-gene and RdRP kits, Roche) (not shown), they are likely to have a reduced sensitivity as compared to that calculated for the E-gene.",
