Methods. Data were collected in the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a random sample of the Dutch population. The coronavirus survey started on March 2, and the data collection ended on March 17 2020.

A negative finding is that respondents with respiratory problems and diabetes, who are considered groups at severe risk for complicated health problems when infected, did not take preventive measures more often than others. In addition, we found no indications that people took preventive measures irrespective of their education level and sex. The last findings suggest that specific education level and sex-related interventions should be developed and offered to increase preventive behavior among men and those with a lower education level.",

Which interventions to stimulate constant preventive behaviour are most effective? These questions are highly relevant because to date there are no indications that this pandemic will end soon. Furthermore, taken preventive measures should be assessed more in detail, and self-reports on measures taken should be complemented with peer-reports. In addition, future studies should pay special attention towards children and how they perceive the risks for coronavirus infection and if and how they protect themselves.",

The LISS panel has received the international Data Seal of Approval (see https://www.datasealofapproval.org/en/). Data on corona-related questions will be added to the open access data archive soon. The data collection with respect to the coronavirus started on March 2 2020 (T2). Because of the rapid developments of the corona outbreak, we choose to use the data collected until March 17 2020 11.00 AM (N invited =6,735, response=70.1%). A reminder was send on the 10th day. Data on physical and mental health problems and loneliness of the respondents before the corona outbreak were extracted from two surveys conducted at the end of 2019. These are Social Integration and Leisure survey (T1 a ; conducted in October-November 2019, N invited =5,929, response=84.2%) and the Health survey (T1 b ; conducted in November-December 2019, N invited =5,954, response=86.4%). The data of the three surveys were linked and in total 3,540 adult respondents participated in all three surveys. We furthermore assessed 16 exclusive demographic profiles among the total adult Dutch population 2019 (N 2019 =13,926,066), based on data of Statistics",
