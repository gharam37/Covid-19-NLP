In this study, we develop a mathematical model to explore the effects of social distancing on new disease infections. Mathematical analyses of our model indicate that successful eradication of the disease is strongly dependent on the chosen preventive measure. Numerical computations of the model solution demonstrate that the ability to flatten the curve becomes easier as social distancing is strictly enforced. Based on our model, we also formulate an optimal control problem and solve it using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and an efficient numerical iterative method. Our numerical results of an optimal 2019-nCoV treatment protocol that yields a minimum disease burden from this disease indicates that social distancing is vitally important.",

A schematic diagram of the model is given in Fig. 1 . Upon introduction of the disease, individuals transition among these compartments. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that a recovered individual is no longer able to be infected. The incubation frequency of the virus is denoted by \u03b1 and the inverse of the average length of infection is given by \u03b3. The parameter \u03b2 is defined as the average rate of person-to-person contact times the infectivity (the probability per that an infected individual transmits the disease to a susceptible individual). We account for the effect of social distancing with the parameter \u03c3. Social distancing refers to the absence of large gatherings, avoidance of physical contact, and other efforts necessary to mitigate the spread of 2019-nCoV.",

By decreasing \u03c3 from 1 to 0.5, we can see the effect of flattening the curve as social distancing is increased. This is a natural consequence of the model because the effective contact rate is reduced (i.e. \u03c3\u03b2 is reduced). The base-case, in which the effective contact rate is unchanged (i.e. \u03c3 = 1), results in a peak population infection rate of 9% after just 44 days since the disease starts spreading. With \u03c3 = 0.75, the peak infection rate reduces to 6.3% after an additional 16 days, and \u03c3 = 0.5 results in an infection rate of only 2.6% nearly 46 days later.

In this region, T N grows rapidly until the curve saturates (i.e. nearly the entire population is infected). Thus, the added value of enforcing social distancing for 100% of the population, corresponding to \u03c3 = 0, is insignificant when compared to the case \u03c3 = 0.3, where only 70% of the population obeys the protocol. Furthermore, there is only one new infection in the population when \u03c3 = 0.149, but nearly 90% of the population is infected when \u03c3 = 0.763.

Our analyses show that social distancing play directly affects the basic reproduction number, and hence the stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Our model simulations demonstrate that the total disease burden from 2019-nCoV can be mitigated by flattening the curve with a carefully chosen value for the coefficient of social distancing.
