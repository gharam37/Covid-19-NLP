The pandemic curve has been explored for above average affected countries, six regions and global scale during 64 days of 22nd January to 24th March, 2020. The global cases infection as well as recovery rate curves remained in the ranged of 0 -9.89 and 0 -8.89%, respectively. The confirmed cases probability density curve is high positive skewed and leptokurtic with mean global infected daily population of 6620. The recovered cases showed bimodal positive skewed curve of leptokurtic type with daily recovery of 1708. The change point detection helped to understand the CoVID-19 curve in term of sudden change in term of mean or mean with variance. This pointed out disease curve is consist of three phases and last segment that varies in term of day lengths. The mean with variance based change detection is better in differentiating phases and associated segment length as compared to mean. Global infected population might rise in the range of 0.750 to 4.680 million by 24 th April 2020, depending upon the pandemic curve progress beyond 24th March, 2020. Expected most affected countries will be USA, and UK with at least infected population of over 0.100 million. Infected population polynomial projection errors remained in the range of -78.8 to 49.0%.",

Length of last segment remained in range of 3 to 5 days except for Western Pacific region with 36 days representing pandemic cool down period. The global pandemic curve characteristics include 51 days, 6 days, 4 days and 3 days from first phase to last segment of the curve. The mean CPD ignore temporal variance of the data. So, the mean and variance CPD provide in-depth information above CoVID-19. The first phase length was found shorter for Western Pacific and East Mediterranean region with 6 to 7 days (22nd January to 28th January, 2020) followed by European (25 days), American (31 days), African (34 days) and South East Asia (42 days on 3rd March, 2020). All regions varied in term of second phase period and sharp rise in cases are observed for American (2 days) followed by European (5 days), South East Asia (9 days), Western Pacific (15 days), African (17 Days) and Eastern Mediterranean (23 days). The third phase displayed that African region is facing least impact due to pandemic (5 days) followed by South East Asia (6 days), Western Pacific (7 days The polynomial approach is assessed to determine best fitting order for CoVID-19 estimation and projection based on percent error ( Table 1 ). The WHO situation report confirmed cases of 1st April, 2020 is used to evaluate the infected population projection for all three polynomial order. The 2nd order polynomial is found best in predicting infected population for Western Pacific region (R 2 = 0.97) and China (R 2 = 0.96) with error ranging between -15.7 to The polynomial fitting also support in understanding the curve status and its association with socio-economic policy decisions. The 2 nd order polynomial association with Western Pacific region especially for China explained that CoVID-19 pandemic wave 1 has passed its peak and subsided to its lowest level. While, all regions and countries best fitted with 3rd order polynomial have reached closer to its peak; due to delayed policy action or lateral spread through local transmission. The 4th order polynomial refers where disease spread is at its initial stage and expected to grow exponentially; requiring strict policy action to curtail epidemic.",

Leptokurtic high and sharp peaks are observed for Western Pacific region (kurtosis = 26.6; mean = 1541), followed by American (kurtosis = 6.7; mean = 1011), South East Asia (kurtosis = 5.2; mean = 50), African (kurtosis = 4.9; mean = 25) and European (kurtosis = 4.3; mean = 3539). Platykurtic lower with broader peak is only observed for Eastern Mediterranean region (kurtosis = 6.7; mean = 454). The global confirmed cases showed highly positive skewed (skewness = 2.2) and leptokurtic (kurtosis = 6.8; mean = 6620) peak with extreme values on the right side tail. Regions recovered cases are highly positively skewed (Skewness = 1.5 to 3.7) except for bimodal moderately skewed Western Pacific region (skewness = 0.6). Leptokurtic high and sharp peaks are observed for European region (kurtosis = 17.1; mean = 315), followed by South East Asian (kurtosis = 15.0; mean = 2), American (kurtosis = 14.6; mean = 9), African (kurtosis = 4.9; mean = 1) and Eastern Mediterranean (kurtosis = 4.6; mean = 150). Approximate Mesokurtic peak is only observed for Western Pacific region (kurtosis = 2.7; mean = 1231). The global recovered cases showed high positive bimodal skewed (skewness = 2.0) and leptokurtic (kurtosis = 10.0; mean = 1708) peak with less extreme values on the right side tail.The pandemic curve is further evaluated to detect the multiple change point in time series to identify the phases and associated length period at selected countries, regions and global scale(Fig. 4, Extended Fig. 4 to 8). Each curve showed three phases of change along with last curve segment length. The first phase represent the hidden CoVID-19 incubation time period which indirectly represent emptiness of policy based actions to surround the spread. The second phase represent the exponential rise time and conversion into high risk for disease spread. Third phase signify disastrous impact on community health and economy. The last segment length denote time taken for the flattening of curve through lockdown, social distancing and other policy actions to curtail the exponential growth of pandemic event. Longer and lower last segment represent decline of the CoVID-19 curve.",

The global pandemic curve characteristics include 6 days, 45 days, 6 days and 7 days from first phase to last segment of the curve. Further details for CPD related to affected countries are available in supplementary information.The CPD help to understand the CoVID-19 curve in term of sudden change but lacks information about temporal trends and provide short term projections related to infected population. We attempted to evaluate simple and robust approach of polynomial curve fitting to estimate and project infected population (Fig. 5, Extended Fig. 9 to 10). Global infected population of 0.373 million confirmed cases is estimated with 2rd order polynomial (R 2 = 0.87) that will increase to 0.750 million (R 2 = 0.87), 1.900 million (R 2 = 0.96) and 4.680 (R 2 = 0.99) with 2nd, 3rd and 4th order polynomials, respectively by 24 April, 2014. The projected infected population remained in the range of 0 to 0.700 million (Western Pacific), 0.500 to 2.650 million (European), 0.006 to 0.048 million (South East Asia), 0.080 to 0.150 million (Eastern Mediterranean), 0.120 to 0.990 million (American) and 0.003 to 0.0230 million (African). The selected countries projections remained in the range of 0.000 to 0.625 million (China), 0.180 to 0.690 million (Italy), 0.115 to 0.960 million (USA), 0.095 to 0.600 million (Spain), 0.080 to 0.480 million (Germany), 0.072 to 0.128 (Iran), 0.050 to 0.300 (France), 0.024 to 0.145 (Switzerland), 0.000 to 0.025 (South Korea), 0.019 to 0.125 million (UK), 0.012 to 0.076 million (Netherlands), 0.012 to 0.076 million (Austria), 0.010 to 0.061 million (Belgium), 0.008 to 0.025 (Norway), 0.006 to 0.044 million (Canada) and 0.002 to 0.016 (Pakistan).",
