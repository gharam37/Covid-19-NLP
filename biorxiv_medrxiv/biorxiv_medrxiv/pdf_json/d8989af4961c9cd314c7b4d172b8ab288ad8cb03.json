Neutralizing antibodies provide efficient blockade for viral infection and are 25 a promising category of biological therapies. Using SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD as a bait, 26 we have discovered a panel of humanized single domain antibodies (sdAbs). These 27 sdAbs revealed binding kinetics with the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 28 0.7\u223c33 nM. The monomeric sdAbs showed half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) 29",

Neutralizing antibodies directly target viral 171 envelope protein, precisely block the virus-receptor association, and inhibit virus entry 172 through a variety of molecular mechanisms. In this study, we isolated and 173 characterized several humanized neutralizing sdAbs that exhibit one-to two-digit 174 nanomolar or even sub-nanomolar IC 50 against SARS-CoV-2 using both pseudotyped 175 and infectious viruses. SdAbs have been investigated as important therapeutic 176 alternatives against viral infection because of their high yield, low cost and intrinsic 177 stability. For MERS-CoV, neutralizing sdAbs were isolated from immunized 178 dromedary camels or llamas and demonstrated IC 50 value between 0.001-0.003 179 \u00b5g/mL with low KD values (0.1-1 nM) 13,14 . Comparable inhibition efficiency on 180 SARS-CoV-2pp and affinity kinetics were obtained for the sdAbs 2F2, 3F11 and 5F8 181 identified in this study using a non-immune library, which can speed up the discovery 182 of neutralizing antibodies in an emergent outbreak. With further optimization and 183 increase of library size and diversity, the synthetic sdAb library technology will 184 promote the discovery speed of powerful therapeutic antibodies 15,16 . the first sdAb-based medicine for adults with acquired thrombotic 186 thrombocytopenic purpura in 2019 17-20 . Considering the cost and potential risks of full 187 human antibody in some viral diseases, such as dengue virus infection, sdAb 188 fragments are a novel category of therapeutic molecules and can be readily 189 reconstructed in a tandemly linked way to increase their blood residential time, 190 biological activity, and eliminate underlying concerns about antibody-dependent 191 enhancement (ADE) of viral infection 21 . In addition to being used as an injectable drug, 192 the stable sdAbs can be also developed into aerosolized inhalations and disinfection 193 products for the prevention of COVID-19. Besides, prior to the success of COVID-19 194 vaccines, the construction of sdAb-based adenovirus or adeno-associated virus gene 195 therapy might provide long-term passive immune protection in vulnerable population, 196health care workers, or in severely affected areas. Since the mature COVID-19 animal 197 models have not been developed, this study did not involve in vivo studies. As a next 198 step, the crystal structure analysis of antigen-antibody complexes will be put on the 199 agenda. In conclusion, the discovered neutralizing antibodies in this study could lead 200 to new specific antiviral treatments and shed light on the design and optimization of 201",
