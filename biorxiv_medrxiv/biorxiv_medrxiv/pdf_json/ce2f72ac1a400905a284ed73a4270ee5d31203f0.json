Symptoms of COVID-19 were (range values of point estimates): fever (82-95%), cough with or without sputum (58-72%), dyspnea (26-59%), myalgia or muscle fatigue (29-51%), sore throat (10-13%), headache (8-12%) and gastrointestinal complaints (5-9%). Severe symptoms were more common in men. Elevated C-reactive protein (associated with lymphocytopenia) and lactate dehydrogenase, and slightly elevated aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, were commonly described. Thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of procalcitonin and cardiac troponin I were associated with severe disease. Chest imaging described a frequent pattern of uni-or bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity. Only one review investigated the impact of medication (chloroquine) but found no verifiable clinical data. All-cause mortality ranged from 0.3% to 14%.",

The virus is easily transmitted through person-to-person contact and virus contamination of surfaces or objects [2, 3] . As of April 7, 2020, more than 1,359,398 people have been confirmed to be infected with the virus and over 75,945 people have died as a result of severe complications of the disease [4] . These numbers are likely to be underestimates, as countries are unable to test all patients suspected of having the disease due to worldwide shortages of testing reagents [5] . Estimates put the economic impact of COVID-19 as surpassing trillions of dollars when global trade, travel and business costs are added to healthcare and public health expenses [6, 7] .",

Most reviews were descriptive, as the original studies did not assess the impact of therapies. Antivirals have been used empirically for COVID-19 treatment with the most commonly used being protease inhibitors (lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (tenofovir), nucleotide analog (remdesivir, galidesivir, ganciclovir), and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir). Umifenovir, a membrane fusion inhibitor, was investigated in several studies [16, 24] . Possible supportive interventions analyzed were different types of oxygen supplementation and breathing support (invasive or non-invasive ventilation). Use of antibiotics, both empirically and to treat secondary pneumonia, was reported in some studies. One review specifically assessed evidence on the efficacy and safety of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine [17] . It identified 23 ongoing trials investigating the potential of chloroquine as a therapeutic option for COVID-19, but no verifiable clinical outcomes data. Use of mesenchymal stem cells, antifungals and glucocorticoids were seldom described.",

Olfactory dysfunction (anosmia or dysosmia) has been reported in the scientific literature to occur in some patients infected with COVID-19 but this was not reported in any of the assessed systematic reviews [32,33,34]. During the SARS outbreak in 2002, there were reports of impairment of sense of smell associated with the disease [35,36]. Nasal obstruction and post-viral olfactory disorders are possible reasons for this symptom [37]. The reported mortality rates ranged from 0.3 to 14% in the included reviews. Mortality estimates are influenced by the transmissibility rate (basic reproduction number), availability of diagnostic tools, notification policies, asymptomatic presentations of the disease, resources for disease prevention and control and treatment facilities. Even with more than 1,359,398 people infected as of April 7, 2020 [4], variability in the mortality rate fits the pattern of emerging infectious diseases [38]. Furthermore, the reported cases do not consider asymptomatic cases, mild cases where individuals have not sought medical treatment, and the fact that many countries have limited access to diagnostic tests or have implemented testing policies only very recently [39]. The lack of reviews assessing diagnostic testing (sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of RT-PCT or immunoglobulin tests), and the preponderance of studies that assessed only symptomatic individuals, means that considerable imprecision remains around the calculated mortality rate. Few reviews included treatment data. Those that did described studies offering a very low level of evidence: usually small, retrospective studies with very heterogenous populations. The efficacy of pharmacological interventions therefore remains extremely unclear. Encouragingly, on April 7, 2020 there were 366 clinical trials for COVID-19registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, with many pharmacological interventions being tested, so hopefully this gap in the evidence will be filled soon[40].
