A large scale outbreak of the disease resulted in a pandemic. It became a public health concern all over the world. 1 On the 7th of January, 2020, the etiological agent of the outbreak was identified as a novel coronavirus 2 , and it was renamed as COVID-19 by WHO on the 12th of February, 2020. It is a zoonotic coronavirus which is similar to SARS and MERS coronavirus. 3 The WHO announced it as a \"Public health emergency of international concern\" on the 30th of January,2020. 4 As per the report published by the World Health Organization on the 4th of April, there are 1051635 confirmed cases, around 57 thousand deaths due to COVID-19. About 200 countries, areas, and territories are there with cases of COVID-19 in the world. 5 In much of the world, people exhibiting mild or no symptoms are unable to get tested, meaning that the actual number of cases could be much higher. 6 In the past few weeks, countries such as Italy, Spain, and the United States have shown a massive increase in the number of cases and deaths per day. 7",

As the number of Operational Government laboratories has been increased to diagnose the COVID-19 in India, it is expected that the number of testings will increase in the upcoming days, which will ultimately result in an increase in the number of confirmed cases.",
