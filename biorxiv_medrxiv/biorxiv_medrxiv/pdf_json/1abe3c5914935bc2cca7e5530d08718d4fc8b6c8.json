Here we report the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp either in the apo form or in complex with a 50base template-primer RNA and Remdesivir at a resolution range of 2.5-2.8 \u00c5. The complex structure reveals that the partial double-stranded RNA template is inserted into the central channel of the RdRp where Remdesivir is incorporated into the first replicated base pair and terminates the chain elongation. Our structures provide critical insights into the working mechanism of viral RNA replication and a rational template for drug design to combat the viral infection.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and several members from the beta coronavirus family, including bat and pangolin coronaviruses(3-5). Possibly due to the stronger binding affinity of the virus spike protein with the host receptor(6-10), SARS-CoV-2 appears to have much higher incidence of human to human transmission, resulting in much faster pace of infection worldwide. Tremendous challenges remain with ongoing battles against this notorious viral infection in many countries and finding an effective cure is an urgent need. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive strand RNA virus, whose replication is mediated by a multi-subunit replication/transcription complex of viral non-structural proteins (nsp)(11). The core component of this complex is the catalytic subunit (nsp12) of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (12, 13) . The nsp12 by itself has little activity and its functions require accessary factors including nsp7 and nsp8 (14, 15) , which increase the RdRp activity in template binding and processivity. The RdRp is also proposed to be the target of nucleotide class of antiviral drugs, including Remdesivir(16-18), which is a prodrug that is converted to the active drug in the triphosphate form (RTP) within cells (19) . As such, RdRp has been a subject of intensive efforts of structural biology. The structures of nsp7, nsp8, and the complex of nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 have been determined (15, (20) (21) (22) (23) , providing an overall architecture of the RdRp complex assembly.",

The nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex also showed RNA polymerization activity on a poly-U template upon addition of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in a time course-dependent manner ( Figure 1B-1C ). This RNA polymerization activity was effectively inhibited by the addition of the active triphosphate form of Remdesivir (RTP) ( Figure 1D ). Addition of 1 mM RTP in the presence of 10 mM ATP was able to completely inhibit the RdRp polymerization activity. Remdesivir, as a prodrug, at 5 mM concentration, did not have any inhibitory effect on the polymerization activity of the purified enzyme ( Figure S1F ).",

Negative-stain EM visualization of the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex displayed monodispersed particles in excellent homogeneity ( Figure S1H ). For the apo nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex, we vitrified the sample in the presence of the detergent DDM. The initial attempt of image processing reveals that the particles are preferentially oriented ( Figure S2 ). Therefore, we collected and processed over 7400 micrograph movies of more than 5.7 million particle projections to increase the projection amount from the non-preferential orientation, out of which 81,494 particles are used to yield a density map of 2.8 \u00c5 resolution. Cryo-EM studies of the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex bound to the template-primer RNA and RTP (termed as the template-RTP RdRp complex) were first hampered by the two facts. First, most particles were adsorbed to cryo-EM grid bars rather than staying in the vitreous ice. Second, RNA duplex dissociated from the template-RTP RdRp complex likely owning to the adverse effects during cryo-EM specimen preparation. Eventually, we prepared the cryo-EM specimen of the template-RTP RdRp complex at the concentration of 15 mg/ml supplemented with DDM prior to vitrification ( Figure S3 ). We collected 2886 micrograph movies, which yielded a 2.5 \u00c5 resolution structure using 130,386 particle projections. Because of the relatively high resolution of our structures, EM density map is clear for key structure features across the complex ( Figure S4 ).",

The structure of the template-RTP RdRp complex provides an excellent model to rationalize how these drugs inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp activity ( Figure 5C ). In particular, EIDD-2801 has been shown to be 3-10 times more potent than Remdesivir in blocking SARS-CoV-2 replication (35) . The N4 hydroxyl group off the cytidine ring forms an extra hydrogen bond with the side chain of K545. In addition, the cytidine base also forms an extra hydrogen bond with the guanine base from the template strand.

Enzymes that are vital for the viral life cycle are excellent antiviral drug targets as they are uniquely different from the host proteins. Among viral enzymes, RdRp is the major target of many existing nucleotide drugs. In this paper, we report the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex in the apo form and in the complex with a template-primer RNA and the active form of Remdesivir. The structures reveal how the template-primer RNA is recognized by the enzyme and the inhibition of the chain elongation by Remdesivir. Structure comparison and sequence alignment suggest that the mode of substrate RNA recognition and Remdesivir inhibition of RdRp are highly conserved in RdRp from diverse RNA viruses, providing a basis for designing broad spectrum antiviral drugs based on nucleotide analogs. Moreover, our structures also provide a solid template for modeling and modifying the existing nucleotide drugs, including the highly potent EIDD-2801. Together, these observations provide a rational basis to design even more potent inhibitors to combat the vicious infection of SARS-CoV-2.",
