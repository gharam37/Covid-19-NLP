            "text": "It has been observed that patients that develop a more severe clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection have higher plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting a possible cytokine storm associated with the disease severity [15] . IVIG products have been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of inflammatory disorders [16] . To date, a number of possible mechanisms for the immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory effects of IVIG therapy have been described [17, 18] , including anticomplement effects [19] , anti-idiotypic neutralization of pathogenic autoantibodies [20] , immune regulation via an inhibitory Fc receptor [16, 21] , enhancement of regulatory T cells [22] and inhibition of Th17 differentiation [23] . Thus, IVIG may mediate a wide variety of biological and immunomodulatory effects via various types of blood cells [23] . Altogether, these known immunomodulatory effects of IVIG products could be beneficial in COVID-19 disease management. Anecdotally, there was a case series report describing a positive effect of high dose IVIG in three patients with COVID-19 [24] . It should be noted that IVIG products are generally deemed safe and welltolerated. Most of their adverse effects are mild and transient [25] .",

This evidence supports the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 cross-reacting antibodies in these IVIG preparations. These results together with the known immune properties of IVIG, suggest a potential positive contribution of currently available IVIG products to COVID-19 disease management. Further steps to confirm the functionality of IVIG antibodies such are neutralization studies are warranted.",

In all cases the determinations were carried out following the manufacturer's instructions.Sample preparation and testing IVIG samples were serially diluted using the buffer solutions provided in each IgG ELISA kit. With the IVIG 5% product, the dilution series was: neat (undiluted), 1:5, 1:50, 1:500, 1:1000, and 1:5000. With the IVIG 10% product, the dilution series was: neat, 1:10, 1:100, 1;1000, 1:2000, and 1:10000. Therefore, final IgG concentrations of the samples were: 50 mg/mL, 100 mg/mL, 10 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL, 100 \u00b5g/mL, 50 \u00b5g/mL, and 10 \u00b5g/mL. In SARS-CoV-2 tests, additional dilutions of 1:300 (333 \u00b5g/mL) and 1:600 (167 \u00b5g/mL) were included.Reactivity against the coronavirus antigens in the different ELISA kits was rated as negative (-) if no reactivity was observed even with neat IVIG, or positive (+) if the lowest IVIG dilution demonstrated reactivity. The number of test replicates performed was 2-3 for Gamunex-C, 2-4 for Flebogamma 10% DIF, and 1-2 for Flebogamma 5% DIF.",
