More than 683,536 positive cases and 32,139 deaths caused by novel corona virus 2019 (COVID-19) has affected 199 countries and territories. This pandemic can transform into an extremely destructive form if we still do not take it seriously. In the present study, we propose a generalized SEIR model of COVID-19 to study the behaviour of its transmission under different control strategies. In the model, all possible cases of human to human transmission are taken care and its reproduction number is formulated to analyse accurate transmission dynamics of the coronavirus outbreak. Optimal control theory is applied in the model to pretend the impact of various intervention strategies, including voluntary quarantine, isolation of infected individuals, improving an individual's immunity and hospitalisation. Also, effect of the control strategies on model is analysed graphically by simulating the model numerically.",

Doctors and scientists tested the previously developed drugs to treat the infected people, but that failed to succeed. Then, in February, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of this highly contagious COVID-19 as pandemic globally [13] . To control the human to human virus transmission, the central government of China as well as all local governments had tightened preventive measures. However, the virus had spread rapidly across most of the regions in China and in other countries and territories around the world. One major cause of the quick spread of COVID-19 is the lack of information and awareness about the virus during its early stages of infection. As on March 29, 2020, 13:29 GMT, has affected 199 countries and territories around the world with 683,536 confirmed cases, of which 32,139 have passed away, and 25,422 are serious or critical (worldometers.info). Still there is a possibility that spread of this virus could be more intense and cause high mortality. While the New Year was enjoying their spring vacations, the outbreak of COVID-19 has accelerated, as most of the people were on their way to hometown or else travelling to different places for relaxation.",

The major symptoms of COVID-19 include dry coughing, high fever with difficulties in breathing [16] . The virus may spread in the environment through respiratory droplets of infected individuals when they cough or sneeze. Further an unaffected population becomes infected when they are exposed by touching the infected surface or while breathing in an infected environment [10] . During the initial stages of COVID-19 outbreak, such human transmissions were taking place because, wide-range of public was unaware of these risk factors, and the infected individuals were also not isolated and were spreading the virus unknowingly to other individuals. Moreover, the risk factor of contamination is very high since the virus can remain viable in environment for several days in favourable conditions [3, 12] . Several studies reveal that old-aged people, children and those with major diseases are having low immunity and tend to seriously affected once they become infected [8, 17] . Still, we lack with any proper treatment or vaccines as a cure for this disease. Hence to control its transmission further, isolating the infected individuals in special quarantine cells has been implemented in most of the countries. Despite of these prevention strategies, we are in danger as the transmission is still ongoing and the mortality due to the virus maintains a high level.",

Moreover, basic reproduction number is formulated to calculate threshold value of the disease. In order to develop strategies to prevent the epidemic of COVID-19, optimal control theory is applied to the model. Further to advance control theory, five control variables are introduced in the model in the form of control strategies. These strategies include self-quarantine of exposed individuals, isolation of infected individuals, taking extra care of infected individuals to reduce critical case of COVID-19, increase hospitalisation facility for infected and critically infected individuals. Distinctive and combined effects of these control variables on all the compartments are observed and examined graphically by simulating the COVID-19 model. Numerical simulation of the model reflects that quarantine and better medical treatment of infected individuals reduce the critically infected cases, which will further reduce the transmission risk and demises.",
