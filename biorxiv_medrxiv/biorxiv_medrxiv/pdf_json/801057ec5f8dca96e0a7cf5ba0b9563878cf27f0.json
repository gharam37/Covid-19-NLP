In Iran, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on Day 30 of month 12 (Bahman) in Iranian calendar from Qom, and we used the reported data until March 29, 2020 (15). As of the time of the up to date this article, March 29, 2020, According to the Daily Reports in Iran, 38309 COVID-19, 2640 deaths were reported. in recent weeks, Firstly, universities and schools, then public places and shrines were closed. People are referring to health centers and hospitals, and the public is almost alarmed by the epidemic of panic and inaccurate reporting in cyberspace. The recurring and important questions are: How is the size of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Iran and how long and when will the epidemic go down? We cannot answer these questions with certainty, but it can be investigated in terms of pathogenic behavior (coronavirus), host conditions, behavior (human) and environmental factors of coronavirus transmission, daily reports of definitive COVID-19 patients released by Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education and the use of modeling given the assumptions and the percentage of error. Indeed, although the models are different, multiple, and changeable in nature and do not insist on the correctness of the forecasts, the decision-making conditions for health policy-makers and authorities are more transparent and helpful (16) . This study aimed to model and determine the epidemic trend and predict COVID-19 patients in Iran using mathematical and statistical modeling.",

Patient population growth, epidemic curves, and recovered and deceased individuals were used to conceptual framework of epidemic and predict the COVID-19 epidemic trend. we used classical infectious disease (Susceptible\u2192Exposed\u2192Infected\u2192Removed: SEIR) model in this frame work (19). Different scenarios were designed and implemented for modeling and forecasting. First, based on a search for reliable sources of disease trends and epidemic curves across the world, the curve of Iran was also drawn (10, 16, 20) . Focused and scientific group discussion sessions were held with experts on epidemiology, biostatistics, and mathematics, infectious diseases specialists as well as healthcare managers on the topic, the scenarios were discussed and agreement was reached on the application of the final scenarios. to predict the growth of epidemic different models were used. In the first scenario, the most optimistic estimation and control of the epidemic was during an incubation period (van model) and considering the ideal model. In this scenario traced contacts are isolated immediately on symptom onset (and not before) and isolation prevents all transmission were used. In the second scenario, an intermediate and fit-to-data model (Gompertz) was used. In the third scenario, the use of the growth rate is greater than the first and second models, and in fact opposite to the first scenario (LSE). To select the scenarios, fit the data with the models and growth rate of the cases were used. The Gompertz growth, von Bertalanffy growth equation and curve fitting by LSE method with cubic polynomial for Epidemic forecasts were run in MATLAB software. Models are presented as the following differential equations:",

It is a rigorous government and health care intervention such as social distance that may be implemented more and more strictly on these days. Moreover, according to a valid scientific report, delay in the onset of symptoms until the isolation of patients plays an important role in controlling the epidemic. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R0 of 2.5 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3.5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1.5. For R0 values of 2.5 or 3.5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset (16) . Therefore, it is recommended that efforts be made to control the epidemic with greater vigor and urgency and to conduct a daily risk assessment. In the current epidemiological situation in the world and Iran, fear control and avoidance of rumors are very important for the prevention and control of coronavirus.",

The first point is to help calm down the atmosphere of society and to avoid tension in societies, and the second is to properly interpret the COVID-19 case fatality ratio (CFR) in Iran and calculate it tactfully. It should be taken into account in interpreting this index, since the denominator of the fraction is only positive cases in hospital beds, and numerator is the number of died positive among the positive cases (of those who are hospitalized and/or die). This index should also be calculated until the end of the epidemic period, and if it is until the end of the epidemic and their outcome (death/recovery) is determined, this indicator will approach the real number. The estimated case fatality ratio among medically attended patients was reported approximately 2% (12) and the true ratio may not be known for some time (25) .

            "text": "B and the models of Von and Gompertz for prediction of recovered patients, the model estimated the number of recovered individuals to be 15300 and 15950, until April 3, 2020, respectively. Moreover, according to Figure 4.G, the maximum population of recovered individuals was estimated 15900 according to the method of least squared error. To predict and estimate the number of deaths due to COVID-19, two growth models (Figure 2.C) and the least squared error (Figure 4.I) were used to maximize Von's growth in the most optimistic manner. According to Von, Gompertz and least squared error method, the number of deaths will be, 3600, 4200 and 4850 individuals on April 3, 2020, respectively. For prediction end of epidemic, three models of growth were used. Based on Gompertz's growth model the end of the epidemic is about 13 May, 2020 with the about 87000 patients (Figure 3.D). Based on Von and Gompertz models number of cured cases will be 22000 and 26000, respectively (Figure 3.E). To predict and estimate the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in the end of epidemic Von and Gompertz growth models are used and bsesd on Von model we will have 4900 and based on Gompertz we will have 11000 deaths until 13 May and 1 June, respectively (Figure 3.F).",
