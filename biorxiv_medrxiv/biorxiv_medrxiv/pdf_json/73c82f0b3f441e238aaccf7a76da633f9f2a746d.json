These models use different parameters which are estimated using non-linear fits from the available data. It is found that both SIR and generalized SEIR models give similar estimations for regions where curves show signs of flattening. A study of these models with data from China indicates that in such cases these estimates may be more reliable. However, recent trend indicate that unlike China, the decline in infection rate for the US and other European countries is very slow, and does not follow a symmetric normal distribution. Hence a correction is introduced to account for this very slow decline based on the data from Italy. The estimates with all these models are presented for the most affected countries due to COVID-19. According to these models, the final epidemic size in the US, Italy, Spain, and Germany could be 1.1, 0.22, 0.24 and 0.19 million respectively. Also, it is expected that curves for most of the geographical regions will flatten by the middle of May 2020.",

However, when there are signs of decline in the exponential growth (t 1 in Fig. 3 ) and sufficiently long data is available, these models can be reliable for predictions within uncertainty limits. Though, waiting for the curves to show the sign of flattening, can be relatively late for making policy decisions.

Since, the results from epidemiological models can be dependent on its implementation to estimate parameters, initial condition, etc. even for same underlying data, we use three different models to compare the outcome. Apart from the logistic and simple SIR model, a generalized SEIR model is used that takes into account of quarantined and deceased patients. Further, we introduce a correction to the estimates from these models in order to account from slow decay of infections as seen in Fig. 3 for the US and other European countries. Section 2.1 presents a brief discussion of these models: details of their implementation can be found in the corresponding references given. The corrections introduced to account for slow decay of infections compared to those observed in China are discussed in section 2.4. Section 3 shows the predictions for some key countries and a brief discussion is included. It is not possible to include the estimates for all the countries in this paper. However, it is expected that the reader can make use of these models, codes for which are available in the open-source, to estimate the final epidemic size for regions not included in this paper.

In an outbreak, typically N will increase every day because more people may get affected due to local outbreaks. However, with quarantine and isolation, this number will slowly become constant. Hence, this SIR model, where N is assumed constant, is valid provided measures are taken to ensure N does not increase much with time. In the present situation, most of the countries have taken extensive measures to impose rigorous social distancing and thus increase in N may not be significant. This model assumes equally likely recovery of everyone affected and hence does not consider factors like age, morbidity etc.",

Because of the availability of limited data, predicting both -day of the peak (mean) as well as the spread (variance) is challenging for every model. Further, even if the day of the peak is known the decline rate is often not correctly predicted giving an incorrect estimation of the final epidemic size. Because of the symmetric distribution of the curve, the decline rate is predicted as negative of the acceleration. This is often not true as observed from the COVID-19 data of Italy and Spain, where the decline is very slow. In order to illustrate this point, we show the total infection as well as the rate of infection for Italy in Fig. 5 . The predictions by the three models are also shown. All the three fitted curves show underprediction of total confirmed cases from April 8 despite using data till April 11 for modeling. If we look at the infection rate, we note that the decline rate given by Gaussian-like distribution is much higher than actual decline leading to a lower estimate of the epidemic size. In order to account for this difference, we introduce a new parameter \u03b7, which changes the variance of this distribution for predictions after the peak. Briefly, we fit a normal distribution after getting predictions from SEIQRDP model, and then adjust the spread to make the decline rate realistic. Hence, the new distribution is given by dI dt = \u03b6a exp(\u2212 t\u2212\u00b5 \u03b7\u03c3 ) 2 , where the factor \u03b6 = a 1 /a ensures that number of infections on the peak day remains unchanged. The dash-dot magenta curve shows this new distribution which is much closer to the actual values. The value of \u03b7 is obtained by fitting the curve to Italy and used for subsequent predictions. This corrected model is designated as SEIQRDP(C). Predictions from this model give the upper limit of the predicted cases. Note that, this adjustment was not needed for fitting data of China as the flattening of curve in China was very fast compared to what is seen in the recent past for European countries (see Fig. 3 ).",

Both SIR and SEIQRDP models both give very close predictions of the final epidemic size of around 0.85 million, indicating good convergence of model parameters. As expected, the predicted size from the logistic model is much smaller than this value. Further, flattening of the curve begins in the third week of April. The corrections due to adjustment of deceleration gives the final estimate about 1.09 million. The final epidemic size for all the regions discussed in this paper is given in Table 3 . Figure 6 (b) also shows predictions for deaths using SEIQRDP. It is estimated that total deaths by the end of the epidemic could be around 33000, which is around 4% of total estimated cases. This is a very optimistic case as countries like Italy and France, have respectively reported 13% and 11% deaths per total infections. Fig. 7 shows the infection rate with the SIR model. Though the estimated decline begins on April 6, the curve shows a very long tail (even without correction) till the middle of May for zero new infection. As shown in Table 2 , there is a great disparity in the number of cases in different states in the US. New York alone accounts for 30% of the total cases in the US. Thus, we show predictions for some key states in the US in Fig. 8 . It is estimated that the number of cases in New York could rise to around 0.4 million at the end of epidemic. Estimations for New Jersey, California, Washington, Michigan, and Ohio are also shown and are also tabulated in Table 3 . For some of the states, such as New Jersey, California and Michigan, SIR and SEIQRDP models give slightly different estimates. However, as shown in table 2, these estimates are not very far from each other, and give a range of expected final size. The total number of cases in Ohio may limit to 10945 according to predictions. This may be due to early action of social distancing measures compare to a few other states (see Table 2 . Of course, these predictions depend on the compliance level of the social distancing measures so that governing parameters in the model do not change significantly.",

Further, domestic travel is still allowed in the US unlike India, Italy and France.

Both SIR and generalized SEIR models give similar predictions for regions with signs of flattening of COVID-19 curve, while the logistic model consistently gives lower estimates. Similar estimates with SIR and generalized SEIR models, which use very different parameters and initial values, indicate that the underlying data are reliable to give convergence of model parameters. Thus, the estimations with these models could be more reliable than early estimates in the literature that has used data only from the acceleration phase. However, symmetric distributions of the infection rate predicted by the models around the peak value are not realistic as the decay rate in infections is generally much slower than acceleration as seen from the recent data from Italy and other European countries. Hence, a correction based on the change in the variance of the normal distribution is introduced to account for this factor. This generally provides the upper limit of these estimates. Finally, these models are used to estimate the final epidemic size for key countries where the epidemic outbreak is severe. The epidemic size for a few states in the US are also reported. A good convergence for France, UK, Iran, and India could not be obtained due to recent outbreaks. However, it is hoped that these models give a reasonable estimate for range of final total infections and can be used with confidence for regions where decline or at least no increase in the infection rate is visible.",

The lockdown in Hubei province, the first epicenter of COVID-19, was enforced on Feb 2, when it had 11,177 cases. The cases in the Hubei province continued to rise till Feb 14 to reach a total of 54,406, with the total number of new cases reported on that day being about 6,200. Since then, there was a gradual drop in reported numbers of cases, and on Feb 15 and Feb 21, the new cases reported were 1,843 and 220, respectively. From Feb 2 to Feb 15, it took around 14 days for the lockdown to show its effect. The flattening of the curve took further 15 days. i.e. from Feb 15 to March 2. further discussions on this can be found in Ranjan",
