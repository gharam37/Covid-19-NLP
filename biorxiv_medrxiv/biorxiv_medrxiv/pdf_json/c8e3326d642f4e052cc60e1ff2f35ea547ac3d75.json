The early detection of this type of virus will help in relieving the pressure of the healthcare systems. Chest X-rays has been playing a crucial role in the diagnosis of diseases like Pneumonia. As COVID-19 is a type of influenza, it is possible to diagnose using this imaging technique. With rapid development in the area of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep learning, there had been intelligent systems to classify between Pneumonia and Normal patients. This paper proposes the machine learning-based classification of the extracted deep feature using ResNet152 with COVID-19 and Pneumonia patients on chest X-ray images. SMOTE is used for balancing the imbalanced data points of COVID-19 and Normal patients. This non-invasive and early prediction of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) by analyzing chest X-rays can further be used to predict the spread of the virus in asymptomatic patients. The model is achieving an accuracy of 0.973 on Random Forest and 0.977 using XGBoost predictive classifiers. The establishment of such an approach will be useful to predict the outbreak early, which in turn can aid to control it effectively.",

An enormous amount of effort is being put into developing vaccines and drugs to help treat the infection 9, 10 . Speaking of India, the country currently stands at 9, 205 confirmed cases and 331 deaths. There has been a 21-day complete lockdown in India as a measure to prevent further transmission, but whether India is coping up with the disease or not continues to be a big question.

Convolution neural network (CNN) is one of the most popular algorithms that have shown high precision in the ability to interpret the COVID-19 classification with medical images like X-rays or CT images. Wang et al. 19 has proposed a COVID-19 classification technique by implementing the CNNs based on Inception Net over the pathogen-confirmed COVID-19, with 453 computed tomography (CT) images and reported an accuracy of 82.9%. Songet al 20 has implemented a multi-class classification to recognise the diseases (COVID-19 viral infection, non-COVID and bacterial pneumonia) with CT images (88 patients with COVID-19 infected, 86 non-COVID patients and 100 patients with bacterial pneumonia)by using a modified version of pre-trained ResNet-50 net-work, named as DRE-Net and reported an accuracy of 86% for bacterial pneumonia and viral pneumonia (COVID- 19) classification.",

Pre-processing of the Dataset It could be seen that all the acquired X-ray images are of variable shapes and sizes, which increases the difficulty in effective classification. In order to effectively perform classification tasks, image preprocessing is performed. There exist many automatic and semi-automatic techniques for detecting abnormality in the body of the patient, but the absence of reliable and precise techniques can cause ambiguities in the classification process. Keeping aforementioned challenges in the mind, ML based predictive classifiers are used for analyzing the chest X-ray images, which are further discussed in the following sections. X-ray images are taken with a low resolution which may have a variable height to width ratio. In order to facilitate training and testing of the deep networks, necessary pre-processing steps like image cropping and resizing is performed. In the proposed method, all input images are first converted to a standard size of 224 \u00d7 224 for a similar course of action in both the developed model.",
