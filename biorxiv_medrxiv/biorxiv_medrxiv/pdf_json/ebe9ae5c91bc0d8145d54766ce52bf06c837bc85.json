This is done based on the data for the number of total infections and daily infections, respectively. Studying the convergence behavior of the two parameter sets obtained this way, we attempt to estimate the reliability of predictions made concerning the future course of the epidemic. We validate this procedure using data for the case numbers in China and South Korea. Then we apply it in order to find predictions for Germany, Italy and the United States. The results are encouraging, but no final judgment on the validity of the procedure can yet be made.",

Considering the serious effects of these measures on the affected societies and the ensuing political discussions on their intensity and duration, it would be highly desirable to be able to make modeling based predictions on the future timeline of the epidemic, as long as the measures are upheld. Of course, many attempts are made in this direction. However, most of them require very detailed data that are laborious and time-consuming to generate.",

We are aware, that these numbers depend strongly on the intensity of testing done in the various countries and the reliability of the reported numbers. In this work we presume that there is a factor, country-specific, but constant in time, between the reported and the actual number of cases. If this assumption were valid, the total number of infected individuals would be off by this very factor. However, other parameters, like the point in time when the peak in the numbers of daily infections would occur, or the following rate of decay of these numbers, would not be affected.",

Both countries can be considered to be in a late stage of the epidemic and the data are matched well by the model.
