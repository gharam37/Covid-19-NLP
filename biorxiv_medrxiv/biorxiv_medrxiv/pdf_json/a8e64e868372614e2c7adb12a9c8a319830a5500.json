While case counts in the entire region remain considerably less than those being reported by individual countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, SSA countries remain vulnerable to significant COVID morbidity and mortality due to systemic healthcare weaknesses, less financial resources and infrastructure to address the new crisis, and untreated comorbidities. Variation in preparedness and response capacity as well as in data availability has raised concerns about undetected transmission events.",

The World Health Organization's (WHO) State Party Self-Assessment Annual Reporting (SPAR) database assigns scores to countries to assess capacities needed to detect, assess, notify, report, and respond to public health risk and acute events of domestic and international concern.1,8 Similarly, the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) developed by the RAND Corporation and the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) by Johns Hopkins University 9 use a variety of healthcare, economic, demographic, and political factors to assess the vulnerability of a country to prevent or contain an infectious disease outbreak.10 Using such indices, recent work has shown most of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to be at risk of COVID-19 importation and at reduced capacity to contain outbreaks due to lack of economic and medical resources.1 While it appears that the age groups at highest risk of severe COVID-19 disease and death (those >60 years old)6,11 may be proportionately less in many SSA countries than in other parts of the world, the populations in many of these countries are at increased risk of having untreated chronic conditions due to weak health systems.12 As a result, individuals with cardiovascular diseases or diabetes,13,14 sickle-cell disease, or conditions associated with immunosuppression,15,16 which exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV2 infection, may contribute to higher-than-expected mortality for younger age groups.",

The clusters in Table 2 are sorted by the average proportion of the population aged 60 years and over, given its established relevance to COVID morbidity and mortality. In general, countries with larger proportions of their populations over 60 years (Clusters D and E) had higher healthcare capacity ( Figure 5A ), in terms of number of HCWs and hospital beds per capita. On average, cluster E countries have the largest proportion of their populations in the over 60 age range and high rates of premature death due to NCDs but also higher capacity for detecting and treating, than other clusters ( Figure 5B ). Despite having relatively low proportion of their populations over 60 years, countries in cluster C were considered at high risk since they tended to have fewer healthcare workers and hospital beds per capita, and a higher probability of premature death due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) than the countries in the other four clusters ( Table 2 ). Four of the eight countries not yet reporting cases as of March 27th (Burundi, Comoros, Lesotho, and Sierra Leone) fell into Cluster C.

As of March 30th, eight countries --Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mauritius, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa --had reported at least 100 confirmed cases each, while seven countries had reported no cases (Botswana reported its first case on March 30th).29 Regional heterogeneity in reported case counts suggests that higher incidence in some places may be due in a large part to preparedness and current surveillance efforts, particularly around air travel passengers, and not solely due to more transmission. Relatedly, lower incidence in other countries may be due to reduced international air travel and the inability to surveil all air passengers and informal border crossings. Overall, importations into a country may take weeks or months to seed community spread at noticeable levels.30 Many importations and subsequent transmission will go unnoticed without active monitoring through quarantine and testing to identify infections among travelers 31, and risk communication directed at population subgroups most likely interacting with international travelers to encourage vigilance around symptom onset.",

More worryingly, among individuals with no recent travel history, conflation of disease symptoms may lead to lack of timely health seeking and reduced access to healthcare could prove detrimental as the disease progresses and transmission increases.33 All of these factors could contribute to lower incidence being observed and reported. This in turn contributes to a false sense of the SSA region being less vulnerable to COVID-19 infection --an argument that has been largely focused around age distribution alone --when the sub-Saharan population may in fact be more vulnerable given the number of endemic, infectious and immunocompromising diseases,16 as well as increasing non-communicable conditions,12 and poor critical care infrastructure in the region.",

Factors around population demographics and comorbidities uniquely relevant to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality may not be fully captured by the GHSI or other epidemic preparedness indices.

For instance, we note that data being disseminated to the public are often for purposes of information sharing and education rather than to guide detailed decision making. Moreover, with increasing incidence, less information is provided publicly about cases at the individual-level, leading to lack of information on sex, age, and status (importation versus local transmission) for the majority of cases in South Africa, for instance.
