            "text": "In late 2019, a new Coronavirus disease, referred to as Corona virus disease 2019 , emerged in Wuhan city, Hubei, China, and resulted in a global pandemic-claiming a large number of lives and affecting billions all around the world. The current global standard used in diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected cases is the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Although the RT-PCR remains the standard reference for diagnosis purposes, it is a timeconsuming and expensive test, and moreover, it usually suffers from high rates of false-negatives. Several early works have reported that the sensitivity of the chest Computed Tomography (CT) and the chest X-ray imaging are noticeably greater than that of the RT-PCR test at the initial representations of the disease, making them great candidates for developing new and sophisticated methodologies for analysis and classification of COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we establish the use of a rapid, non-invasive and cost-effective X-ray-based method as a key diagnosis and screening tool for COVID-19 at early and intermediate stages of the disease. To this end, we develop a novel and sophisticated deep learning-based signal and image processing technique as well as classification methodology for analyzing X-ray images specific to COVID-19 disease. Specifically, we consider a semi-supervised learning methodology based on AutoEncoders to first extract the infected legions in chest X-ray manifestation of COVID-19 and other Pneumonia-like diseases (as well as healthy cases). Then, we utilize this highly-tailored deep architecture to extract the relevant features specific to each class (i.e., healthy, non-COVID pneumonia, and COVID-19) and train a powerful yet efficient classifier to perform the task of automatic diagnosis. Furthermore, the semi-supervised nature of the proposed framework enables us to efficiently exploit the limited available dataset on COVID-19 while exploiting the vast amount of available X-ray dataset for healthy and non-COVID classes. Moreover, such a semi-supervised approach does not require an expert-annotated lesion area for each class. Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-theart methods for COVID-19 identification while employing approximately ten times fewer training parameters as compared to other existing methodologies for classification of the COVID-19 from X-ray images (facilitating efficient training in a limited data regime). We further develop explainable artificial intelligence tools that can explain the diagnosis by using attribution maps while providing an indispensable tool for the radiologist in triage state. We have made the codes of our proposed framework publicly available to the research and healthcare community 1 .",

With the daily increase in the number of newly diagnosed and suspected cases, the diagnosis has become a growing problem in hospitals around the world due to the insufficient supply of test kits and limited diagnosis rates [1] . With limitations of sample collection and transportation, as well as kit performance, the total positive rate of RT-PCR for throat swab samples has been reported to be about 30 to 60 percent at initial presentation. In the current public health emergency, the low sensitivity of RT-PCR implies that a large number of COVID-19 patients would not be identified quickly and may not receive appropriate treatment or isolation. In addition, given the highly contagious nature of the virus, they carry a risk of infecting a larger population. Moreover, the use of nasal or throat swabs to get at an official diagnosis could be frustrating, particularly when specimens from the upper-respiratory tract might show a negative result even though all clinical signs indicate otherwise. There is therefore an urgent need to look for fast alternative methods that can be used by front-line health care personnel for quickly and accurately diagnosing the disease.",

Patients and clinicians typically have to wait a few hours to get the imaging results, but such deep learning tools are improving the diagnosis speed for each case and are helping sites with limited medical resources to immediately screen out suspected patients for further diagnosis and treatment.

            "text": "Since the emergence and the global outbreak of the COVID-19, there has been a plethora of research regarding developing automatic deep learning-based diagnosis tools for the classification of the disease using the chest CT and X-ray images. The most notable works so far are as follows. The authors in [3] have established an automatic early screening model for the COVID-19 based on lung CT images. In particular, they considered the problem of distinguishing the COVID-19 pneumonia from Influenza-A viral pneumonia and healthy cases using deep learning techniques. In particular, they used the traditional pre-trained ResNet architecture to first extract the relevant features from the CT images associated with each case, and then, they concatenated an additional fully-connected network with location-attention mechanism to combine both feature extractor and fully-connected classifier network to improve the overall accuracy. The dataset considered in their study consists of total of 528 CT images for training and validation data-sets, with 189 samples of COVID-19, 194 samples for Influenza-A viral pneumonia, and 145 samples for healthy cases. As for the testing dataset, they used a total of 90 CT images where each class represented by 30 samples in the testing dataset. Their studies suggest an overall accuracy of 86.7% for the considered three groups. A similar study on developing deep learning-based automatic segmentation and quantification of COVID-19 was carried out in [8] . Specifically, the authors in [8] proposed a novel deep architecture known as VB-Net to segment COVID-19 related infected regions in the CT images. Furthermore, for preparing the training dataset for their proposed VB-Net, they adopted a human in the loop (HITL) strategy to further enhance the manual annotation of the relevant regions. Finally, their numerical investigations have shown that the resulting VB-Net shows promising results for automatic segmentation of lung CT images specific to COVID-19. This is of particular importance due to the fact their proposed VB-Net can accelerate the development of high quality datasets for the COVID-19 by providing a deep learning-based automatic segmentation technique to accelerate the generation of algorithmic identification of COVID-19. Similar to the work of [3] , the authors in [9] utilized a transfer learning methodology to devise a novel deep learning-based algorithm for screening of COVID-19 using lung CT images. More specifically, the authors in [9] first randomly extract regions of interest (ROI) from the CT images. Next, a pre-trained Inception network [10] was utilized in conjunction with a fine-tuning stage for re-purposing the pre-trained Inception network for extracting the features from the corresponding ROIs. Finally, a fully-connected network was utilized to classify the COVID-19 and typical viral pneumonia (a total of two classes). The dataset considered in [10] is consist of 453 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 as well as typical viral pneumonia (non-COVID). As for the training dataset, they used 217 CT images for the training and transfer learning purposes. Finally, the proposed model in [10] assumes a total accuracy of 73.1% with specificity of 67% and sensitivity of 74%. Along the same lines, the authors in [11] have considered the identification of COVID-19 based on the chest X-Ray images in lieu of lung CT images. In particular, they considered a transfer learning-based approach using three pre-trained models: ResNet50, InceptionV3, and ResNetV2 for the task of distinguishing between normal and COVID-19 X-Ray images. Their numerical investigation demonstrated that the ResNet50 model achieved the highest accuracy among the considered three pre-trained model with an overall accuracy of 98%. One might notice the very high accuracy obtained in the work of [11] ; nevertheless, such a performance is expected due to the fact that the authors have considered a rather simple classification task, i.e. distinguishing between COVID-19 and normal cases. Presumably, a more comprehensive study must consider a rather more significant task such as classification of three classes: healthy, non-COVID and COVID-19 cases or the task of distinguishing between non-COVID pneumonia and COVID-19 cases in that the difference between the manifestation difference of healthy and COVID-19 X-ray images is drastically high and such a task can be performed with high accuracy using even smaller and less complicated models.",

For the training of the resulting network known as COVID-Net, the authors prepared an open publicly available dataset referred to as COVIDx dataset which is an amalgamation of two open access data repositories: the COVID-19 image data collection and the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset [13, 14] . The COVIDx dataset consists of 16, 756 chest radiography samples with 76 radiography images for the COVID-19 case, 8066 images for the healthy patients, and 5526 patient cases who have non-COVID pneumonia. As for the development of the COVID-Net proposed in [12] , the authors utilized a human-machine collaborative design strategy to prototype the network in conjunction with network architecture exploration design tool provided by the Darwin AI, Inc. Finally, it was shown that the COVID-Net architecture achieves an overall accuracy of 92.4% with a sensitivity of 95%, 91% and 80% for healthy, non-COVID, and COVID-19 classes, respectively. Moreover, the achieved positive predicted value (PPV) for each class is as follows: 91.3% for the healthy class, 93.8% for the non-COVID infection type, and 88.9% for the COVID-19 case.",

This step conventionally consists of designing an image processing unit to first extract the useful features of likely high-dimensional input signals (images). Then, a classifier network will be trained to distinguish between different classes according to the learned features. Note that the infection regions in chest radiography images are low-contrast and admit a large variation of shape and position in different suspected cases, and hence, pinpointing the infected region in the images is an extremely challenging task in designing a successful image processing unit. However, with the advent of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the more recent 3-D CNN models (suitable for analyzing CT images), one can easily tackle such a difficult task when the input data is likely high dimensional. Indeed, the CNN model has shown a great promise in medical imaging applications and currently is the de facto model for such tasks. In this paper, we also make use of CNN models to design a powerful classifier as well as a novel image analysis methodology. After a successful design of the model, one seeks to learn the network parameters using the prepared dataset at the previous stage. Another challenge in this stage is that each class needs to be well-represented (i.e., a large number of data is required for each class) so the network can generalize well to unseen cases.",

For instance, if the network has a large number of parameters to be optimized (i.e., very high capacity) and the training data points are limited, the model is susceptible to over-fitting, leading to a small training error and a large test error. In such a case, one needs to either increase the available data at hand via either collecting new samples or using advanced data augmentation techniques, or to change the underlying model entirely.",

In fact, the studies as well as the expertise required in properly labeling and annotating the existing data points barely exist for such efforts. This in turn directly affect the performance of the underlying model both in training and testing phase-making it difficult to train a high capacity network and to properly asses its performance in real-world clinical applications. On the other hand, there exist a vast amount of information and dataset on other pneumonia-related diseases (e.g., Influenza-A) and one needs to design a sophisticated model that can deal with incorporation of other large datasets with the existing limited data on COVID-19, so that both classes can be well-represented while training the network. Note that such a mixture of limited representation of one class and another well-represented class can easily degrade the performance of a classifier. Hence, it is of paramount importance to develop novel sampling techniques for training purposes. Second, due to the limited amount of training datasets on the new corona virus, one should avoid using high capacity networks in that they are highly prone to over-fitting for limited data. One way to alleviate this problem is to use the transfer learning method. In transfer learning methodology, one takes a pre-trained network that can successfully perform a task in another context, and transfer the model using a fine-tuning stage to the new task. Although such an approach can be undertaken in the case of COVID-19 classification, the performance of the resulting network can be limited due to the fact that the pre-trained network might not be able to extract the unique features entirely, as it is trained on another dataset.

On the other hand, a common narrative among all the existing works is the fact that the algorithm and the network is designed in a supervised manner (i.e., supervised learning methodology), where the underlying model makes use of expert knowledge and heuristics for both extracting the relevant features from the data and the network architecture design. Such a supervised methodology requires a human in the loop strategy for most (if not all) of the stages in the model and further has an inherent bias towards the way it is being supervised which in turn will reduce the possibility of letting the model exploit unique information from the available limited data at hand during the training (that might seem irrelevant to the supervisor). In order to tackle the problems associated with supervised learning methodology, one can resort to unsupervised and semi-supervised learning methods. Specifically, in an unsupervised learning framework, one designs a model that can intelligently and automatically gain insight from the raw data without supervision and further use the derived information for the task of decision-making and classification. In fact, all of the existing works on identification of COVID-19 from medical radiography images make use of pre-trained networks for preparing the data to be propagated through the classification network in a supervised manner. These models are often ignorant to the fact that the classification is not the only purpose of the underlying algorithm and there exist other stages that can dramatically affect the performance of the model. In particular, an unsupervised learning methodology for compression, feature extraction, and denoising at early stages of the network can result in a tailored task-specific understanding of the data which can greatly improve the performance of the classification algorithm. On the other hand, a semi-supervised methodology can be interpreted as a bridge between supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. In a semi-supervised approach the classification task is performed in a supervised form, while learning the representation of the data is performed in an unsupervised manner to allow for an enhanced generalization of the classifier.",

Such a methodology differs from the existing deep learning models for the task of COVID-19 classification as our model ensures learning the unique data and feature distribution of Healthy and non-COVID cases independently. Namely, the current methodologies use a pre-trained feature extractor network that is trained on non-related datasets (e.g., real-world images) and usually have a very large number of parameters for fine-tuning.

Hence, to address this issue, we propose to use a task-specific feature extraction network that is tailored to handle chest X-ray images associated with the three classes considered in this work, i.e. Healthy, non-COVID and COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, due to the closeness of the chest X-ray manifestation of COVID-19 as compared to to other pneumonia diseases, the proposed TFEN module will designed in a manner to signify the abnormality regions in the chest that is most affected by COVID-19 as compared to healthy and non-COVID classes in a semi-supervised manner. Namely, we make use of AutoEncoders in this module and train the overall TFEN module in a semi-supervised manner to extract the relevant features and information from the raw data. The next step in our proposed methodology, is the CIN module which is tasked to perform the classification based on the extracted residual features from the TFEN module.

Then, such an abnormal regions will be fed into the classifier to differentiate between the three classes. It is a well-known that the success of supervised learning approaches in most classification tasks is closely related to the existence of high-quality datasets with a very large number of data samples. However, this is not the case in the classification of the COVID-19 from the X-ray images, as the available datasets are either not freely available to the research community, or comprised of very limited cases of COVID-19. Hence, any deep architecture with very high number of parameters trained on these datasets are prone to over-fitting and other classification issues. Furthermore, there exist very high-quality datasets on healthy chest X-ray images as well as non-COVID pneumonia cases. Note that human professionals can detect and segment the anomalies appearing in the chest X-ray images by training on very limited data points, and can further generalize the gained prior information to unseen cases. Namely, by providing a human professional with limited healthy and pneumonia chest X-ray images, the person can easily detect the abnormal regions and differentiate between the two very accurately. Indeed, humans make use of prior information very efficiently to recognize the abnormal sections of the X-ray images. This hints us to develop a semi-supervised feature extraction network that allows for obtaining the relevant prior information necessary for anomaly detection in the chest X-ray images, and then, exploit this prior to perform the classification task in order to mimic the human behaviour more closely. Due to the fact that the COVID-19 samples in the considered dataset are very scarce as compared to the other two classes (e.g., Healthy and non-COVID infection), we first use the information from these two high quality classes (Healthy and non-COVID) as a basis for detecting the abnormal regions in the chest X-ray images that will be used as the input to the classifier network. the network will be equipped with a classifier deep architecture to accurately distinguish between the three classes based on the extracted abnormal regions; more on this below.",

Consequently, the input to such a system is a set of signals following a certain distribution, i.e. x \u223c P(x), and the output is the recovered signalx from the decoder module using the latent representations. In short, the goal is to jointly learn an abstract representation of the underlying distribution of the signals through the encoder module, and simultaneously, learning a decoder module allowing for reconstruction of the input signals from the obtained abstract representations. Therefore, an AE module can be defined by two main functions: i) an encoder function E \u03a6 : X \u2192 Z parametrized on a set of trainable variables \u03a6, that maps the input signal x \u2208 X into a new vector space known as the feature or latent space Z, and ii) a decoder function D \u03a8 : Z \u2192 X parametrized on \u03a8, which maps the data from the latent space Z back into the original signal space X .

Let X i H and X i P denote two samples from the X-ray images corresponding to Healthy and non-COVID classes, respectively. Then, the anomalies appearing in the infected chest manifestation appear as local variations in certain parts of the healthy chest. Furthermore, let us consider the 2 norm as a measure of distance between a Healthy and non-COVID chest X-ray image quantifying the affected regions. Then, it might be the case that there exists another healthy X-ray image X j H such that,",

Now, we discuss the next stage in the TFEN module. Let X denote any data-point from the underlying dataset with all three classes represented. For instance, let us consider the case that X is a sample from the non-COVID class. Further letX P H = F H (X) andX P P = F P (X) denotes the reconstructed signals when X (belonging to non-COVID class) is fed to the two AEs, respectively. An interesting observation here is that the AE trained on Healthy cases will not be able to reconstruct the input fully as the class of the input (non-COVID in this example) is different from the class assigned to the AE. On the other hand, when a sample from non-COVID case is fed into the AE corresponding to non-COVID cases, the difference between the reconstructed image is much smaller than that of the Healthy autoencoder. In other words, the Healthy autoencoder tries to create a healthy-looking chest X-ray image while signifying the anomalies appearing due to the non-COVID infection regions. Hence, one can capture those anomaly and differences between different classes by simply considering the absolute intensity differences between the reconstructed signals and the input of each individual AE, i.e. the residual images E 1 = |X \u2212X P H | and E 2 = |X \u2212X P P |. The same argument holds for the case that the input is sampled from COVID-19 data points. Indeed, the residual images E 1 and E 2 are providing a measure of distance between the input sample and the corresponding classes that each individual AE is trained on. With this observation in mind, we suggest to use the residual images as the output of the TFEN module to be fed into the classifier network. More concretely, we define the output of the TFEN module as the 3D tensor X o \u2208 R 3\u00d7d1\u00d7d2 whose horizontal slices are given by:",

Instead, we inject the information regarding the COVID-19 to the algorithm pipe-line during the training of the classifier. In fact, for training (and also inference), each point in the dataset will be cross-correlated with the two AEs in the TFEN module successfully trained on two classes of Healthy and non-COVID (which we have enough samples to capture the relevant features), and the output is the 3 dimensional tensor consisting of residual images to perform the classification task accordingly.",

The output of the TFEN module is a 3D tensor that contains the information regarding the residual images obtained from each already trained AEs. Namely, given a sample point from the dataset (representing all classes), we first feed that image into the two trained AEs corresponding to Healthy and non-COVID classes.

Transfer learning is a methodology concerned with transferring knowledge from a network that is trained on another (but similar) task to perform a different task that is similar in nature. In particular, during the transfer learning, one consider the use of a pre-trained deep architecture that is trained on a very large dataset, and fine-tune the weights of the pre-trained network, to transfer the pre-acquired knowledge (in terms of fine-tuning the weights of the network) to perform another task. In particular, a pre-trained CNN on image analysis task is shown to be able to extract the significant patterns appearing in images. Hence, due to the nature of our work that deals with X-ray images, it is most suitable to consider a pre-trained network on images for fine-tuning for our purpose. Furthermore, it is well-known that the use of pre-trained network for transfer-learning not only reduces the training cost, but also immensely helps the performance in the case of limited datasets. Due to the success of transfer learning methodology and the promising fact that the pretrained networks (if used properly) can provide superior performance for classification tasks, in this work we consider a modified light-weight ResNet-18 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet [18] for our CIN module to perform the task of classification.",

Agarwal et al. [15] showed harnessing a generative model for removing features in input images leads to better attribution maps. Due to lack of good generative models for Chest X-Ray images, we chose one of the widely used perturbation-based algorithms 12 .

The proposed methodology is comprised of two modules: 1) the Task-Based Feature Extraction Network (TFEN), and 2) the COVID-19 Identification Network (CIN). The TFEN module is trained based on a semi-supervised methodology and makes use of two autoencoders that allows for automatic segmentation of the infected regions from a latent representation viewpoint. Furthermore, the TFEN module allows for capturing the unique features of each class for later use in the CIN module. Next, the output of the TFEN module is fed into a powerful classifier to provide a classification task on the underlying data. Overall, the proposed methodology is a task-specific deep model and can be seen as an amalgamation of semi-supervised feature extraction methodology, transfer 13 .
