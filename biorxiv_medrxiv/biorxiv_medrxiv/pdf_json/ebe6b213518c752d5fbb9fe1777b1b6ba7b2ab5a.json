Surprisingly, a recent small-scale clinical trial showed no clinical improvement was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care for treating patients with severe disease [20] . However, Deng et al. found that lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol, another drug against SARS-CoV, might show benefit in delaying clinical progression of COVID-19 and attenuating viral transmissibility [21] . Chloroquine is newly recognized as potential effect against SARS-CoV. In our study, chloroquine was used to treat four (7.3%) patients, mostly used on Overall, it needs to take a long time to identify or invent effective medicine for COVID-19. From our data, patients with severe disease were more likely to be treated by antibiotic therapy, intravenous systemic corticosteroid, intravenous immune globulin, thymosin injection, probiotics tablets, LMWH injection, high-flow oxygen nasal cannula support and mechanical ventilation, which, to some extent, may explain the longer duration and higher cost of hospitalization in severe patients. Our team also used new techniques to treat the critically severe patient, such as transfusion of convalescent plasma, ECMO, and even lung transplant. No significant difference was found in the duration of conversion from the positive PCR test to the negative one after admission (Table 3 & Figure 3B ), however, patients with severe disease had the tendency to stay longer in hospital after the negative PCR test. SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus causing COVID-19, has been proved to bind the entry receptor of host cells called angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), the same as previous SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV[25]. ACE2 is a protein with 805 amino acids and diffusely expressed in heart, vessels, lung, kidney and gut. It functions as the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, playing a pivotal role in renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) [26] . When infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus predominantly targeted ACE2 in human alveolar type 2cells, resulting in pulmonary symptoms [27] . It has been reported that ACE2 was associated with comorbidities, symptoms and complications in COVID-19 patients, such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and gastrointestinal abnormalities [28] . However, the mechanism still remains unclear. Chen et al. found that SARS-CoV-2 might attack pericytes of human heart, thus causing capillary endothelial cell dysfunction, leading to cardiovascular disease and cardiac injury[29]. Jin et al. suggested that gastrointestinal epithelial cells had a high affinity to ACE2, indicating the potential of fecal-oral transmission and the tendency of gastrointestinal symptoms in dissemination [3] . Despite SARS-CoV-2 had a huge relationship with ACE2, whether ACE2 could be a therapeutic target still remains controversial and needs further research. In Wuxi, potent and strict measures have been taken since the outbreak of COVID-19. People need to wear face masks and use Wuxi Health Code when going out.

Suspected patients would receive the nucleic acid PCR test and those who got a positive result would be admitted to hospital immediately. Every confirmed patient with COVID-19 would be arranged in the negative pressure ward of a designated infectious hospital for treatment. Those who got discharged still need the PCR test again two and four weeks after discharge, respectively. Of all patients, one patient retested positive of stool samples. Several limitations do exist in our study. First, this study included only 55 cases thanks to good monitoring and screening in Wuxi, which may cause some statistical and selective bias of our results. Second, no immune function test like serum T cells or cytokines and some other tests like serum lactate dehydrogenase were involved in the laboratory test. As such their role might be underestimated in causing severe disease. Third, this study was limited to the local investigation, and the findings may be inconsistent with nationwide or worldwide studies, which may decrease its credibility.",

Our results supported person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and suggested that patients with severe COVID-19 may be more likely to have an older age, present with lymphopenia and bilateral lung infiltration, receive multiple treatments and stay longer in hospital. Further large-sized and randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to identify the effective treatments for COVID-19.",

Wang et al. discovered chloroquine blocked virus infection in vitro with EC 50 of 1.13\u03bcM[22] and Yao et al. found hydroxychloroquine was more potent (EC 50 =0.72\u03bcM) than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2[23], providing more options for drug treatment of COVID-19. Recently, it was reported that remdesivir might have a promising effect against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir (GS-5734) is an adenosine analogue, which incorporates into viral RNA chains, and has been confirmed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 efficiently in vitro with EC 50 of 0.77\u03bcM[22]. The first patient of COVID-19 in United States showed a good clinical response to remdesivir[24]. Meanwhile, several clinical trials (NCT04257656, NCT04252664 and NCT04292899) are under completion to evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of remdesivir.",
