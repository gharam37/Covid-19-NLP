However, any such model will rely on parameters that are unknown, which in practice are estimated using stochastic and poorly measured quantities. As a result, an early prediction of the long-term evolution of a pandemic will quickly lose relevance, while a late model will be too late to be useful for disaster management. Unless a model is designed to be adaptive, it is bound either to lose relevance over time, or lose trust and thus not have a second-chance for retraining. We propose a strategy for estimating the number of infections and the number of deaths, that does away with time-series modeling, and instead makes use of a \"phase portrait approach.\" We demonstrate that, with this approach, there is a universality to the evolution of the disease across countries, that can then be used 1 .

Gearing up for providing the health care supplies including critical equipment such as ventilators requires an accurate estimate of the number of infections. But the key information that is required for this modelling, which is the number of infected people at any time, is in itself marred by uncertainties. There has been an acute shortage of testing kits required for extensive screening. As a result, although symptomatic patients may have been traced or tested, a significant fraction of the global infections are believed to have been through asymptomatic patients. 13 Although a pandemic such as COVID-19 appears as a once-in-a-century event, the 21st century has already seen a few others which drew very close: SARS in 2003, swine flu in 2009, MERS in 2015. Thus, having tools to quickly plan for the critical resource requirements is important.",

Inter alia, we also make predictions based on early data for Italy and New York state, update them, and demonstrate good agreement between the subsequent evolution of the pandemic and our predictions. Our approach can be summarized as follows: The COVID-19 data from most countries suggests that, especially in the growing phase of the pandemic, the number of active cases and the number of hospitalizations are both proportional to the total number of infections: approximately around 70-90 % and 20-30%, respectively. This conclusion is arrived at by eliminating \"time\" as a variable, and focusing only on the above-cited ratios. Moreover, it is quite easy to update our estimates on a weekly basis.",

Moreover an analysis of the raw time series data from several countries reveals that there is no universal value for r across countries. This is illustrated in Figure: 1A.

While this fraction might depend on country and quality of testing, it is more likely that an infected person who may die due to other health complications will be in hospital. To do this, we incorporate a scaling factor to account for the extensiveness of the testing. It is believed that, to date, the most extensive screening tests have been performed by South Korea, detecting most of the symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals.

This uncertainty factor that was calculated from the COVID-19 infection data of South Korea as a reference can be used for estimating infections when the number of deaths are known. \u03b2 = corrected infections reported infections was assumed to be 1 for South Korea. At any time in the evolution of the pandemic shown on this I versus D graph, using the known number of deaths in that country, the number of infections were rescaled to match with the infections in South Korea and this factor was used as \u03b2. The figure illustrates the procedure used for \u03b2 when deaths are slightly lower than 10, equal to 10 and 20. of a higher median age (for example in Italy) are infected compared to individuals of a slightly lower median age (for example in Germany). However, remembering that the objective is to plan for the resources needed for the individuals who are currently infected, the lower death rate is likely to predict the number of infections on the safer side as far as resource planning is concerned. The estimate of infections from these two different approaches will be used to set the limits on the number of infected individuals, and the resources required.",

In this subsection we discuss the estimation of r, the rate at which the infection spreads. A typical way to estimate r is to fit the time series of I(t) by an exponential. As pointed out earlier, when I is small, fitting a time series to an integervalued (and possibly noisy) variable is problematic. Instead, we use the slope of dI/dt versus I ( Figure:2A) to estimate r. Instead of applying Eq 2 exactly with all the attendant uncertainties in I and r, we use a piecewise strategy. A simple discretization of this in time steps of \u2206t gives I(t + \u2206t) = I(t) + r t,t+\u2206t \u00b7 I(t). It was seen from the COVID-19 infection data from several countries that as the number of daily new infections fluctuates considerably, the trends from the data can be captured only by following the data over a few days. We work with a \u2206t = 7 days, since inferring r from the data drawn over a shorter duration or making a prediction more fine-grained than this do not seem to be relevant from a practical point of view.",

There is a self-replication phenomenon at different scales, wherein the universalities in the patterns between the nations and at a national level, now are reflected between the individual states or provinces. This observation can be used by the governments of these provinces to plan for the worst-case scenario. Each pandemic is different in its ability to persist, infect, and diffuse through the population. While the medical knowledge and critical equipment required may differ from the earlier pandemics, as long as the universalities discussed in this work are seen in the data, one can certainly learn from other countries, states or provinces that experienced the same pandemic a few weeks or months earlier.",

Adapting the geometric ratio week by week serves two objectives: (i) smoothing out the daily fluctuations in data, and (ii) bridging the gap between predictions made using early data, and current data. The simplicity of the formalism, and its data-aware design permit us to make adaptive predictions for the next few weeks, starting at any time. Although COVID-19 is a rare pandemic, the quick, simple and adaptive principles laid out here, embracing the limitations of testing and drawing on the universalities of the progression, should be relevant for any pandemic spreading through person to person contact.",

Thus, assuming the risk profiles of infected individuals are constant across countries, the number of observed deaths can suggest another way of estimating the number of infected. We use two different measures of the number of infected: one by the number of individuals who test positive and two by the estimated number of infected individuals by studying the number of deaths. It is understood that the assumption comes with limitations: firstly the testing in South Korea may not have completely captured all the infections but only a majority; secondly the number of deaths per 1000 infections may be different if individuals 5 .",

At the end of week 2, by taking note of the reported data, the predictions for weeks 3 to 5 are updated. The reported number of deaths and infections are also shown. In comparison, the prediction of the number of deaths was more accurate. It should be noted that number of deaths also gives one a better estimation of the critical resources required. This could potentially be because the infections grow exponentially and the testing resources grow linearly thus increasing the gap in the reported infections.",

As it can be seen, the prediction at week 4 improved after retraining using the data from week 2. A similar adaptive prediction for the number of COVID-19 infections in Italy is shown inFigure :4B, using death and infection count as two independent estimates. The predictions for death were more accurate than the predictions of infections. This could be theoretically possible if the number of tests increase linearly with time, while the infections grow exponentially, thus increasing the gap of untested individuals. Many countries which initially allowed testing or hospitalizations during the initial phases of the pandemic have made the criterion stricter as the resource gap increased over time. Overall, it is clear that the trends in the number of infections can be captured with this simple approach. The model is simple enough that it can be repeated easily for making the predictions of the COVID-19 cases in any other state or country, each of which can be adapted on a weekly basis. We show these results for the New York state (Figure:5) and India (Figure:6). One can see the same pattern as for the data from Italy that the predictions of COVID-19 deaths in New York improves with the iteration. The prediction of infections continues to be an higher than the reported infections, just as in for the data from Italy. The numbers of deaths and infections predicted for India are still low, and at this point seem to be in accordance with the predictions.",

The adaptive predictions were performed for the data from India, just as described inFigure:4 and Figure:52.5 Outlook for disaster managementVarious governments may wish to use the number of infections as a metric to test the effectiveness of their containment measures, because the fatalities in a pandemic depend not just on the nature of the virus, but on many more variables, such as patient history, quality and availability of healthcare, and preparedness. Thus both the number of infections and deaths need to be predicted and validated. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a sudden spurt in the demand for critical health services. The planning, production and distribution of these resources in itself require lead times of several weeks to months. Hence, there is a need to have a disaster management plan that can predict the resource requirement in the weeks to come. But a forecast done based on noisy inputs from the early days of infection may turn out much a like a long-term weather prediction. While epidemiological models often attempt to predict the rate of infection spread, the requirements for critical patient care are often not directly modelled. The predictive model developed here is distinctive in using fatalities (D) as the key parameter rather than the number of reported infections (I). This key observation, coupled with the use of a phase plot (corrected infections versus deaths) allows us to provide projections for the critical health-care sector. We have performed this exercise for India and for indivdual states (see",
