The heterogeneity was assessed by using the I 2 test, with I 2 >50 % indicating the existence of heterogeneity. If there is significant heterogeneity, a random effect model (DerSimonian-Laird method) was used to calculate the pooled effect; otherwise, the fixed model (Mantel-Haenszel method) was used. Possible publication bias was evaluated via observing the symmetry characteristics of funnel-plots. If the number of included studies in each outcome was <10, the funnel plot was not performed due to limited power [9] . Data analysis was undertaken using STATA, version 15.0 (Stata Corp).",

Moreover, the presence of coexisting illness (such as DM, HTN, CHD, COPD) was more common among patients with severe disease than among those with nonsevere disease. We all know that the elderly with basic diseases, especially those with diabetes usually have a high blood glucose status for a long time, so their ability to defend against infection is low [32] . They are at high risk for various infections, and once infected, they can easily develop into severe diseases. The lower sensitivity of women to viral infections may be due to the protection from X chromosomes and sex hormones, which play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity [33] . So, we think that elderly male patients with underlying diseases are at high risk for severely ill with COVID-19 and needs special attention from clinicians.",

SARS-CoV-2, also known as the sister virus of SARS-CoV, has 85% nucleotide homology [39, 40] . The latest pathology reports [41] found that the pathological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are similar, mainly manifesting as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure, which also explains the cause of multiple organ dysfunction in critically ill patients. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to infect human respiratory epithelial cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors on human cells [42, 43] . Many studies [34, 44] have found that the levels of ACE2 RNA was higher in heart, kidney, intestinal tract, gallbladder, adipose tissue and testicles than lungs in human body, which also explains the reason why multi-organ dysfunction is prone to occur in severe patients.",

Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients have higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (Tbil) (ALT: WMD = 16.97 [2.18, 31.76]), AST: WMD = 20.60 [6.81, 34.40 ], Tbil: WMD = 3.93 [2.01, 5.86]), but creatinine (Cr), albumin (ALB) and neutrophil count (N count) does not seem obvious difference (Cr: WMD = 8.32 [-1.63, 18.28], ALB:WMD = -5.74 [-7.94, -3.54], N count, WMD=2.92 [-1.33, 7.17]). Regarding of C-reactive protein (CRP) and Procalcitonin (PCT), severe patients were higher than non-severe patients (CRP: SMD = 2.11 [0.71, 3.51], PCT: WMD = 0.16 [0.04, 0.28]). What'more, our study found that compared with non-severe patients, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) and D-dimer (D-D) increased more significantly in severe patients (LDH: SMD = 2.0 [1.20, 2.80], CK: WMD = 23.55 [17.08, 30.02], D-D: WMD = 0.67 [0.02, 1.32]).",

Second, populations, risk factors analyzed, lengths of follow-up, and statistical methods might differ and cause study heterogeneity. Third, although this study reviewed the risk factors of severe COVID-19 patients and their impact, assessing the effect size of each risk factor and developing risk models were important. Conclusion The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia has placed great pressure on intensive care resources in hospital, especially in some developing countries where lacking of medical staff and health resources, so early identification of severe patients and taking active and effective measures can reduce deaths.
