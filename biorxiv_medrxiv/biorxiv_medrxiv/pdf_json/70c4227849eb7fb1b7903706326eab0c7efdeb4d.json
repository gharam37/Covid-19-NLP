The variation in the total number of cases in the plateau region is attributed by China for the repatriation and coming of infected foreigners coming from abroad, the values of new cases are of a similar order between China and South Korea, however, the number of infected people in China is about 8 times greater so the difference in the plateau region for both countries.

This K value corresponds to Figure (3a) can be determined from the inflection point between the phases (b), of accelerated growth, and (c) of slowed growth of the growth curve, the y-coordinate value of the inflection point corresponds to K/2. Mathematically, the derivative or rate of change of the Logistic Function over time results in a function with a maximum peak that is associated with the inflection point (Figure 3b ), and that function can be expressed by a Gaussian function to determine the time t at which the maximum occurs. The derivative of the total number of cases over time is nothing more than the number of new cases over time. Therefore, the tipping point of the function total number of cases occurs at the same time as the maximum number of new cases; and when determining the time t of the maximum number of new cases, we have the x coordinate to determine the total number of cases in the inflection that corresponds to the maximum limit of the total number of cases divided by 2.",

We can read the graph of total number of cases by defining the initial date D0 and the total initial number of cases N0 as a reference for the model. Subsequently, we verify in the New Cases graph the date that the maximum number of new cases occurs DCNmax (if the maximum is not clear, it is necessary to perform a Gaussian function adjustment to determine the time t that occurs). Then we can see in the graph the total number of cases on this date DCNmax which is the value of the total number of cases NTC_DCmax, this is the value corresponding to the inflection point of this graph and thus the maximum limit value \"K\" corresponds to twice the NTC_DCNmax, allowing to know the limit of the total number of cases in that country. In order to be able to estimate by the Logistic Model, when the stability phase (Plateau) of the total number of cases, where there are practically very few new cases, will be reached we calculated the time interval Ti between the date of maximum new cases DCNmax and the initial reference date D0. From that time interval Ti, of the value of the maximum limit of total number of cases of COVID19 \"K\" patients and of the total number of initial cases of reference N0 it is possible to calculate the date by which, using the model, the total number of cases will be 90% K (D90%), 95% K(D95%), and 99% K (D99%).",
