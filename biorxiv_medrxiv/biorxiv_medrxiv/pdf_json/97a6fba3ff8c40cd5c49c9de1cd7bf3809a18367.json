Basic principles of early intervention treatment of COVID-19: on the premise of no effective antiviral drugs, treatment is based on supportive and symptomatic therapy (albumin supplementation, supplement of potassium, supplement blood plasma, etc.) in order to maintain the stability of the intracellular environment and adequately reactivate body immunity to clean up SARS-CoV-2 .",

Especially in all severe patients, 20-40g albumin / d was given, adjusted according to the heart function. Appropriate plasma supplementation had been applied in 68.8% severe and all critical cases, which could supply immunoglobulins and lymphokines to support the body's normal antiviral effect. We think that plasma (especially fresh plasma) supplementation has better supportive treatment effects than extracted immunoglobulins.

Shortness of breath was shown in all severe patients, which was 92% of ICU patients in the research of Huang et al [3] . A large scale multicenter research [12] of 1099 COVID-19 patients from 31 provinces reported 95.5%, 81.5% and 59.6% of severe cases had low lymphocyte count, high CRP and high D-dimer respectively, which were significant difference from non-severe ones. In the research of Huang [3] , low lymphocyte count, hypoalbuminemia and high D-dimer had been found common in severe COVID-19 patients, particularly in critical cases in ICU. In addition , we also found the hypokalemia and high BNP were more significant in severe cases than non-severe ones. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 viremia should also be paid attention to, as a predictor for progression to severe. Except for the abnormal values of above indicators, we found that it was more important to observe the changing trend of these indicators during course of disease. More significant low lymphocyte count and high CRP appeared in severe patients from the beginning and continued the whole course, which indicated the imbalance between early immune response and lateral inflammatory reaction. Liu [11] et al reported that mean days from illness onset to ICU admission were 8d in the severe or critical type. In our study, the peak of obvious abnormality of D-dimer and BNP appeared at day 8-9 of the disease course and then decreased slowly, which indicated early recognition of critical signs and the risk of secondary thrombosis and myocardial injury. The persistent hypoalbuminemia and hypokalemia suggested that the imbalance of homeostasis , at the same time instructed treatment. Some characteristic imaging findings, such as GGO, nodules, stripe and patchy consolidation , bronchial abnormalities, were consistent with previous studies [3, 12, 16] . The abnormal images on lung CT were corresponding to the pathological features of COVID-19 pneumonia [17] . Two types of acute exudative pathological changes had been considered corresponding to imaging change in these COVID-19",

According to the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, early and timely intervention is important. In this study, none of the 97 patients had basic diseases of immune dysfunction. Therefore, it is considered that immune dysfunction and internal environmental disorder are transient after the virus infection. So in the treatment, we mainly focused on symptomatic and supportive treatment in the early stage, such as adequate supplementation of albumin, plasma and potassium, in order to maintain the stability of the intracellular environment and adequately reactivate body immunity to clean up sars-cov-2 by themselves, which is consistent with Lei Zhang's opinion [18] .",

A meta-analysis [19] shows that glucocorticoid is a more effective drug for suppressing the occurrence of inflammatory storms, and it is safe within a certain dose range. The emergence of COVID-19 inflammatory storm is often life-threatening in a short time, with a variety of inflammatory factors [3] , so the effect of single IL-6 mAb on COVID-19 should be further evaluated [20] . If the inflammatory storms could not be suppressed timely, multiple organ failure and death might be caused. So far, glucocorticoid may be unique effective medicine suppressing the progress of the inflammatory storm with appropriated and reasonable application. The application of glucocorticoids in viral pneumonia is currently controversial. A retrospective cohort study about SARS showed that glucocorticoids can reduce case fatality rate and hospital stays [21] , but there are also studies that show that glucocorticoids may increase the case fatality rate of SARS patients and delay the virus clearance time [22, 23] .In patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and influenza virus pneumonia, the use of glucocorticoids is also controversial [24, 25, 26, 27, 28] . Application indication and dosage of corticosteroid had been strictly controlled from the beginning of epidemic of COVID-19, and corticosteroid had be recommended not be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV-induced lung injury or shock outside of a clinical trial [29] . Although this issue has always been controversial [30] \uff0cclinical usage of corticosteroid was obviously restricted, and the role was underestimated greatly.",
