Washington state announced the first imported case of COVID-19 in the United States on January 21, 2020, while community transmission of COVID-19 has been identified since late February in Northern California. The vast majority of cases in California are concentrated in counties surrounding the San Francisco Bay in Northern California, and Los Angeles in Southern California. These regions were also among the first to implement intensive public health interventions aiming to curtail transmission. Social distancing recommendations for vulnerable populations were issued in San Francisco on March 6, 2020, and large gatherings were banned in Washington on March 11. Large-scale stay-at-home orders were implemented March 17 for the six counties of the San Francisco Bay area, and statewide in California and Washington on March 19 and March 24, respectively. Understanding the impact of these interventions is of crucial importance to inform their broader use, and may help to account for regional differences in the severity of COVID-19 epidemics across the country. 7 To inform the epidemiology of COVID-19 in these regions, we analyzed healthcare data covering all hospitalized COVID-19 cases within the cohort of 9,596,321 individuals receiving comprehensive, integrated care from Kaiser Permanente (KP) healthcare systems in Northern California (KPNC), Southern California (KPSC), and Washington state (KPWA).",

[8] [9] [10] We analyzed clinical and administrative data captured from all KP members who had been hospitalized within these KP care delivery systems with COVID-19 laboratory or clinical diagnoses at any recorded healthcare encounter by April 9, 2020. We considered patients to be clinically confirmed if no positive test result was available and diagnosis codes included any of the six diagnoses listed in Table S1 . Clinical diagnoses were overruled by negative laboratory test results. Encounters included hospital, outpatient, and telehealth visits as well as uses of laboratory diagnostic services. We limited hospitalizations to acute inpatient admissions occurring between 14 days before to 28 days after the first encounter resulting in a COVID-19 diagnosis. Because only the most recent clinical encounter resulting in a COVID-19 diagnosis was available for KPWA patients, we considered COVID-19 hospitalizations to include those for which admission or discharge occurred within 30 days of the most recent COVID-19 encounter. Observational admissions were excluded. For the KPNC and KPSC cohorts, hospitalization events were sourced from electronic medical records and outside medical claims. Hospitalizations in the KPWA cohort were sourced from a centralized admissions database.",

We assumed time from infection to hospitalization was distributed according to the sum of random draws from fitted distributions of the time from infection to symptoms onset (incubation period) and the time from symptoms onset to hospitalization.

A small, single-center case series in Seattle, Washington reported an mean age of 70 years among ICU cases, consistent with the patient profile in our study. 27 This observation of older ages in hospitalized US patients may relate to underlying population demographic structure as well as differences in health status and risk factor prevalence in US populations versus those of other settings.",

These reductions precede large-scale implementation of social distancing in the study regions. It should be noted that our daily RE(t) estimates describe transmission resulting from infections acquired each day t, rather than those transmitting on each day t. Because most individuals begin transmitting >4 days after acquiring infection, declines in RE values are expected to precede dates of implementation of interventions that would affect transmission during individuals' infectious periods. Individuals may have also taken precautionary measures to limit risk of acquiring or transmitting infection prior to implementation of stay-at-home orders. Similar observations have been reported in a study of transmission dynamics in King County, Washington. 28 As our method propagates uncertainty in cumulative infection estimates based on time to hospitalization as well as the proportion of infected individuals experiencing symptoms, our approach does not aim to provide precise estimates of changes in RE associated with interventions implemented on particular dates.",

As such, we do not address presenting characteristics of hospitalized patients and their association with demographic characteristics, length of hospital stay, or clinical outcome. Limited availability of laboratory testing in early phases of the US outbreak may have hindered ascertainment of sporadic cases in January and early February, 2020; because all persons under investigation for COVID-19 may not have received testing, our estimates of disease incidence should be interpreted as lower bounds. Near real-time hospitalization data may be missing for a modest subset of cases admitted to hospitals not owned by Kaiser Permanente, which would result in lagged reporting. In estimating transmission dynamics and cumulative infections, we relied on data from other settings to infer COVID-19 natural history parameters including the proportion of symptomatic infections requiring hospitalization, the serial interval, and the time from infection to hospitalization. Increases in the proportion of cases ascertained at later phases of the outbreak would be expected to increase RE estimates over time, contrary to the trend we observed. Last, our estimation of RE required an assumption that the KPNC, KPSC, and KPWA cohorts transmit among each other (or among epidemiologically similar individuals residing in the same areas). Within these regions, individuals receiving healthcare from KP health plans may be wealthier than those without commercial insurance. Economic security and employment type may impact individuals' ability to comply with stay-at-home orders, 29 meaning our estimates of transmission dynamics may not describe circumstances for other populations, including socioeconomically vulnerable groups. Despite this limitation, our use of data on hospitalized cases in a prospectively-followed cohort, receiving care within a unified healthcare delivery system, overcomes inconsistencies affecting RE estimates from syndromic surveillance of milder COVID-19 cases across care providers and jurisdictions. 30",

Although current social distancing measures have provided a crucial stopgap in reducing transmission and protecting healthcare systems to date, 29 hospitals should ensure capacity to manage COVID-19 cases that will continue occurring in the coming months in a manner that is responsive to changes in social distancing or other pandemic-mitigating measures.
