COVID-19 patients and those infected with SARS-CoV-2 need air isolation and contact isolation, single-room isolation, constant air circulation, and disinfection of the air and environmental items to reduce the spread of the virus. A mask (N95) can block 95% of the virus from entering the respiratory tract. Strict implementation of hand hygiene can prevent contact transmission. Due to the intense outbreak of COVID-19 over a short period in Hubei, especially in Wuhan, the isolation wards of medical institutions are unable to accommodate the admission of a large number of patients. Many ordinary wards have been temporarily converted into isolation wards, which fail to meet the \"two-zone, three-passage\" standard. Furthermore, in the early stage of the epidemic, protective supplies such as N95 masks were scarce, and some medical staff lacked awareness of prevention and control. The failure to standardize mask-wearing and hand hygiene led to a large number of infections among medical staff. Recently, a large number of medical personnel in Italy and other countries have also contracted SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is urgent to strengthen COVID-19 prevention and control measures.",

In cases of SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the mouth and nose, immune intervention strategies to increase the local or systemic immunity of the mouth and nose may increase the body's resistance to the virus and make up for the lack of physical protection.",

It is by far the most widely used antiviral biological drug [4] . Because IFN can block the replication of virus particles and has some effect on all DNA and RNA viruses, it may reduce the amount of virus, making the dominant virus infection into recessive virus infection. For general viral infection, IFN can shorten the course of the disease. According to the latest results from the P4 laboratory of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, China, SARS-CoV-2 can inhibit the secretion of IFN by host cells and reduce the ability of host cells to suppress viruses by reducing endogenous IFN levels. Therefore, the use of exogenous IFN in early antivirals may be important. Furthermore, the nasal epithelial cells are the first stop in cases droplet infection of the host by SARS-CoV-2 (dropletnasal-respiratory infection). IFN nasal drops can maintain a high IFN-\u03b1 concentration in the nasal mucosa and inhibit the virus that has accumulated in the nasal mucosal epithelium but has not yet broken through the mucosal immune barrier [5] .",

In contrast, 529 medical personnel who were working in isolation wards and fever clinics for diagnosis and treatment were categorized into the high-risk exposure group. The personnel in this group were in direct contact with infected patients. Baseline information is shown in [6] , as follows: SARS-CoV-2 infection: Positive pathogenic test (nucleic acid or specific antibody), including: a. Asymptomatic infection: The total number of white blood cells was normal or decreased in the early stage of onset and the lymphocyte count was normal or decreased. There was no fever and/or respiratory symptoms and no imaging characteristics of pneumonia. b. Asymptomatic nonpneumonia COVID-19: Normal or decreased white blood cells in the early stages of onset, lymphocyte counts were normal or decreased, and fever and/or respiratory symptoms were observed. There were no imaging characteristics of pneumonia. c. COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed cases: In the early stage of onset, the total number of white blood cells was normal or decreased, and the lymphocyte count was normal or decreased. Fever and/or respiratory symptoms were present. In addition, imaging characteristics of novel coronavirus pneumonia were found, for example, in the early stage, multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes were evident in the extrapulmonary zone. Furthermore, multiple ground glass infiltrations and infiltrates could be detected in both lungs. In severe cases, pulmonary consolidation occurred. Pleural effusion was rarely seen.",

The study shows that if standard first-and second-level protections are strictly implemented, the use of IFN-\u03b1 nasal drops, 2-3 drops per nostril, four times a day can effectively prevent medical staff with low exposure levels (i.e., those not directly exposed to COVID-19) from developing the disease. In addition, the study also shows that IFN nasal drops combined with weekly thymosin alpha subcutaneous injections may help prevent medical staff with high exposure levels (i.e., those who are in direct contact with COVID-19 patients) from developing the disease.",

In some countries, the epidemic situation has progressed rapidly, and the global pandemic trend is apparent [7] . In addition, the study suggests that compared to people who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 before January 23, recently infected patients had more subtle symptoms, but the infectivity has not changed significantly, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 tends to gradually evolve into a low-virulence, highly infectious influenza-like virus [6] . Therefore, experts predict that epidemics of the virus SARS-CoV-2 may recur every autumn and winter, and the virus will coexist with human beings for a long time. For this reason, clinicians and public health scholars currently believe that a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that inhibits coronavirus is essential to prevent recurrent epidemics and mutations both before and after a vaccine becomes available in the marketplace.",

In accordance with China's \"Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Fifth Edition)\", medical personnel working in outpatient departments with suspected or confirmed patients on the ward are equipped with second-level protection for the general diagnosis and treatment of patients. Medical staff involved in the treatment of suspected patients using aerosol-generating procedures (such as tracheal intubation and related operations, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, bronchoscopy, sputum suction, throat swab sampling and the use of highspeed equipment (such as drilling, sawing, centrifuging, etc.), should use third-level protection. Medical staff in general wards should implement first-level protection and strictly follow standard hand hygiene procedures. Hand hygiene should be performed before putting on gloves and after removing gloves. Taihe Hospital in Shiyan City and other hospitals in Hubei Province have all followed the above-described prevention and control plan throughout the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. In addition to following these standard protections, the medical staff of Taihe Hospital in Shiyan City were given IFN-\u03b1 nasal drops with or without subcutaneous thymosin-\u03b11 according to their degree of exposure to COVID-19. Among the medical staff treated with this protocol, there were no COVID-19 cases reported over a 28-day observation period. In contrast, over the same period, more than 100 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed among medical staff at other hospitals in Hubei Province. The results suggest that IFN\u03b1 nasal drops, especially in combination with thymosin-\u03b11, may improve the protection of medical staff against COVID-19 and are an effective supplement to physical protections.",

In terms of vaccine development, although more than 20 vaccines are currently being developed worldwide (the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences has pioneered a small trial to develop a vaccine), conservative estimations indicate that it will be 1-1.5 years before a vaccine is commercially available. Additionally, the research team confirmed the existence of two subtypes of SARS-CoV-2 (the L and S subtypes), and the possibility of new mutations cannot be ruled out [10] . Therefore, experts have raised concerns about whether vaccines developed for early viral RNA sequences will be able to effectively protect against mutant viruses after they become available on the market. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a drug that can effectively prevent coronavirus infection in healthy people to cope with the uncertainty of the 1-to 1.5-year window before a vaccine becomes available on the market and the subsequent decline in the protection rate of early vaccines due to virus mutation.",

It is a secreted protein (mainly a glycoprotein) that has many biological functions, including the regulation of innate and acquired immune responses after infection, in addition to a broad spectrum of antiviral, immuneregulating biological functions. IFN is divided into three types: I, II and III. Type I includes IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2; type II has only one subtype, IFN-\u03b3; and type III includes IFN-\u03bb 1 (IL-29), IFN-\u03bb 2 (IL-28a), and IFN-\u03bb (IL-28b). At present, the \u03b1 subtype of type I IFN is generally used for the development of antiviral drugs because of its strong inhibition of viral replication. According to its amino acid sequence, IFN-\u03b1 has more than 20 subtypes. Common IFN-\u03b1s that have been developed and marketed for antiviral therapy are IFN-\u03b1 1b, IFN-\u03b1 2b, IFN-\u03b1 2a, and IFN-\uf077. The antiviral mechanism of IFN is implemented by activating cell membrane adenylate cyclase on cell surface receptors while promoting the increase of adenylate cyclase, which activates the intracellular antiviral mechanism so that a group of antiviral substances, including viral proteins and enzymes, can be generated. The generation of these substances has the effect of inhibiting virus replication and blocking virus spread.",

In addition, the China-World Health Organization joint inspection expert group reported the numbers of Chinese medical staff diagnosed as COVID-19 pneumonia as of February 23. Among the 422 medical institutions providing diagnosis and treatment services for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, a total of 3019 medical staff became infected with COVID-19, and 1716 cases were confirmed [3] . Cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei starting January 21 are presented in the attached table. Our study began on January 25, and there were no new confirmed cases of COVID-19 among 2944 medical staff members after 28 days of nasal drop intervention. The 2,415 medical staff members without direct exposure to COVID-19 were considered a healthy susceptible population, and the results confirm the effectiveness of IFN-\u03b1 nasal drops for the prevention of COVID-19 in the general healthy population. The 529 medical staff members working in the isolation ward were also free of infections and confirmed cases, proving that the drug can strengthen the protection of medical staff in the isolation ward. These results indicate that for SARS-CoV-2, which is homologous to the SARS coronavirus, recombinant human IFN-\u03b1 nasal drops can effectively compensate for the deficiency of the physical barrier and improve the nonspecific antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 in susceptible populations, and the mechanisms of this effect are clear. In addition, it can reduce the vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 resistance. Furthermore, the safety of intranasal IFN-\u03b1 nasal drops has been effectively evaluated, and no serious adverse reactions or adverse events occurred in the present study. This clinical study has the following characteristics: First, it is the first real-world study of an intervention using IFN-\u03b1 nose drops to prevent COVID-19 pneumonia in healthy susceptible people in the COVID-19 epidemic area. Second, this study began during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei, in late January 2020. Four weeks after the start of the study, the number of COVID-19 pneumonia cases in Hubei Province increased rapidly, while there were no new cases of COVID-19 pneumonia among the more than 2,000 subjects in class A tertiary hospitals in the epidemic area who were treated with IFN-\u03b1 nose drops or IFN-\u03b1 nose drops combined with thymosin-\u03b11; this finding indicates that IFN-\u03b1 has a good preventive effect in people who are susceptible to the virus. Third, this study divided the test population into a low-risk susceptibility group, comprising those who were not directly exposed to COVID-19 pneumonia patients, and a high-risk susceptibility group, comprising those who were directly exposed to COVID-19 pneumonia patients, and a single drug (IFN-\u03b1 nasal drip) or a combination drug (IFN-\u03b1 nasal drip combined with thymosin subcutaneous injection) was administered to the two groups of subjects with different risks of COVID-19 infection. Good preventive effects were achieved in both groups. This study provides insights and corresponding data related to the adoption of differentiated drug prevention methods for susceptible populations with different exposure levels.",

Instead, the study represents a real-world effort initiated by researchers in an emergency to verify the efficacy of IFN-\u03b1 nasal drops for preventing COVID-19 pneumonia in healthy but susceptible individuals. The results of the one-month intervention were very satisfactory and achieved the purpose of proof of concept. The results lay a good foundation for subsequent high-quality randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled studies. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests and serum antibodies tests were not performed for the subjects in this study, so it was impossible to determine whether IFN-\u03b1 has prevents infection with SARS-CoV-2 in healthy susceptible persons; instead, the development of COVID-19 pneumonia was the main evaluation indicator. The main reason for using this outcome was that no COVID-19 diagnostic kits had been approved at the beginning of the study. Subsequent high-quality studies should use combined nucleic acid and serum antibody testing to closely screen double-negative healthy susceptible people as enrolled subjects. COVID-19 pneumonia was used as the secondary evaluation indicator, while a positive nucleic acid or antibody test within 28 days was used as the primary endpoint for assessing the prevention of viral infection.",

We believe that recombinant human IFN-\u03b1 nasal drops can be used as an alternative drug to effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and to protect healthy and susceptible people from viral infection. During the COVID-19 epidemic, recombinant human IFN-\u03b1 nasal drops could play a complementary role along with vaccines, and they are likely to have a suppressive effect on mutant coronaviruses. In the future, recombinant human IFN-\u03b1 nasal drops could be developed, and larger-scale clinical studies can be conducted to verify the preventive effect of this broad-spectrum antiviral drug.
