            "text": "The Coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 originating from the virus \"SARS-CoV-2\" (Chan et al. 2020; CDC 2020) has led to a global pandemic, leading to 823, 626 confirmed global cases in more than 200 countries as of April 1, 2020 (WHO 2020). As the disease began to spread beyond its apparent origin in Wuhan, the responses of local and national governments varied considerably. The evolution of infections has been similarly diverse, in some cases appearing to be contained and in others reaching catastrophic proportions. In Hubei province itself, starting at the end of January, more than 10 million residents were quarantined by shutting down public transport systems, train and airport stations, and imposing police controls on pedestrian traffic. Subsequently, similar policies were applied nation-wide in China. By the end of March, the rate of infections was reportedly receding (Cyranoski 2020) . Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore managed to maintain fairly low infection rates throughout, even though a second wave of infections is appearing in Singapore, perhaps due to incoming repatriates (Lin & Wang 2020) . South Korea, Iran, Italy, and Spain experienced acute initial increases, but then adopted drastic generalized quarantine. This did result in apparent recession of the spread in South Korea, whereas in the other three countries the effect of the policies is not yet clear. In the United States, where both the onset of widespread infections and government responses were comparatively delayed, infection growth currently appears to be explosive. As of April 2 2020, the United States has the highest number of infected cases (\u223c 227k) globally. Given the available data by country and world-wide, there is an urgent need to use data driven approaches to quantitatively estimate and compare the role of the quarantine policy measures implemented in several countries in curtailing spread of the disease.",

            "text": "Existing models analyzing the role of travel restrictions in the spread of Covid-19 either used parameters based on prior knowledge of SARS/MERS coronavirus epidemiology and not derived independently from the Covid-19 data (Chinazzi et al. 2020 ), or were not implemented on a global scale (Kraemer et al. 2020) . In this paper, we propose augmenting a first principles-derived epidemiological model with a data-driven module, implemented as a neural network. We leverage this model to analyze and compare the role of quarantine control policies employed in Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and USA, in controlling the virus effective reproduction number R t Read et al. 2020; Tang et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020a; Wu & Leung 2020; Kucharski et al. 2020; Ferguson et al. 2020) . In the original model, known as SEIR (Fang et al. 2006; Saito et al. 2013; Smirnova et al. 2019) , the population is divided into the susceptible S, exposed E, infected I and recovered R groups, and their relative growths and competition are represented as a set of coupled ordinary differential equations. The simpler SIR model does not account for the exposed population E. These models cannot capture the largescale effects of more granular interactions, such as the population's response to social distancing and quarantine policies. This is where data come in: in our approach, a neural network added as a non linear function approximator (Rackauckas et al. 2020) informs the infected variable I in the SIR model. This neural network encodes information about the quarantine strength function in the locale where the model is implemented. The neural network is trained from publicly available infection and population data for Covid-19 for a specific region under study; details are in the Materials and Methods section. Thus, our proposed model is globally applicable and interpretable with parameters learnt from the current Covid-19 data, and does not rely upon data from previous epidemics like SARS/MERS.",

This can be attributed to the stringent government interventions and strict public health measures including immediate isolation and quarantine impositions in Wuhan and South Korea. This eventually resulted in the halting of infection spread and a corresponding R t < 1 within a month for Wuhan ( Figure  2c ) and within 20 days for South Korea (figure 6c) after the first signs of a pandemic were recognized.",

This is in general qualitative agreement with our forecasting results which show a plateau in Q(t) and R t at R t < 1: Figures 3a,b and 7a ,b. In Italy, as of March 20 th , I(t) is appearing to be linear (Figure 4a) , which is consistent with lower rates of infections being actually reported (Horowitz & Kirkpatrick 2020) and can be taken as a precursor to stagnation. It is also consistent with adoption of strict movement restrictions by the government shortly before the March 20 th date. We forecast that, for Italy, R t will drop below 1 and Q(t), R t both will stagnate between mid to end of April 2020 (Figure 5a , b) indicating halting of the spread of infection.",

Even though the effective R t is still greater than 1 as of April 1 2020 (Figure 8c ), its growth has started to show a decreasing trend and we expect the infection to start showing stagnation with R t < 1 by 20 April 2020 if the current US policies continue without change (Figures 9b, 10a ). This will be accompanied by a continuous ramp up of quarantine policies (Figure 9a ). At its peak, we forecast the infected count to reach approximately 600,000 before stagnation, again assuming no change in US policies. Our mixed model analysis for USA, employing Q(t) learnt from the models of Wuhan, Italy and South Korea in the USA model starting from 1 April 2020, reveals that stronger quarantine policies (Figure 10b ) might lead to an accelerated plateauing in the infected case count, as shown in Figure 10a , and subsequently smaller infected case count. On the other hand, in agreement with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases estimates (Miller 2020) , we forecast that relaxing or abandoning the quarantine policies gradually over the period of the next 17 days may well lead to \u223c 1 million infections without any stagnation in the infected case count (Figure 10a ) by mid April 2020.",

Initial conditions The starting point t = 0 for each simulation was the day at which 500 infected cases were detected, i.e. I 0 = 500. The number of susceptible individuals was assumed to be equal to the respective regional populations, i.e. S(t = 0) = 11 million, 60 million, 52 million and 327 million for Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and USA respectively. Also, in all simulations, the number of recovered individuals was initialized to a small number R(t = 0) \u2248 10. Parameter estimation The time resolved data for the infected, I data and recovered, R data for each locale considered is obtained from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. The neural network-augmented SIR ODE system was trained by minimizing the mean square error loss function L NN (W, \u03b2, \u03b3) = log(I(t)) \u2212 log(I data (t)) 2 + log(R(t)) \u2212 log(R data (t)) 2 (4.16) that includes the neural network's weights W . Minimization was carried out through local adjoint sensitivity analysis (Cao et al. 2003; Rackauckas et al. 2019 ) following a similar procedure outlined in Rackauckas et al. (2020) and implemented using the ADAM optimizer (Kingma & Ba 2014) for 300 \u223c 500 iterations. To avoid over-fitting, the training is stopped when the loss function, L is seen to stagnate and the first derivative I \u2032 (t), R \u2032 (t) is seen to match that of the data. (Lyons 2020) , leads to smaller recovery rate and hence a smaller fraction of the population being transferred from the infected compartment to the recovered compartment in the model described in (4.12) -(4.15). Thus, simultaneous training of W, \u03b2, \u03b3 as described above leads to our model over-estimating the infected case count. As a result, for the USA, we first find the optimal \u03b3 by minimizing (4.16), and then use this value of \u03b3 for minimizing the loss function, L(W, \u03b2) = log(I(t)) \u2212 log(I data (t)) 2 . Such an independent optimization procedure for estimating \u03b3 may lead to small errors in the estimation of R(t). Such errors are seen to be negligible in this case (figure 8a), thus validating this approach for the USA. The estimates of \u03b2, \u03b3, Q(t) obtained using this procedure are shown in table 1. Table  also shows the intervention efficiency defined as the number of days elapsed between detection of 500 th case and the first time when the effective reproduction number reached R t < 1 in the chosen locale.",
