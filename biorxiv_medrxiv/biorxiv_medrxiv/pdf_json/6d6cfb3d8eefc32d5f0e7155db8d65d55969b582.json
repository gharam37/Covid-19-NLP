            "text": "Coronaviridae are a family of large, enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses encompassing alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronavirus divisions 1 as well as unclassified divisions in the sequence databases. The genome is packed inside a helical capsid and is further surrounded by an envelope. The spike protein forms large protrusions from the virus surface, giving the coronaviruses the appearance of wearing a 'crown' under electron microscopy. Coronaviruses have the ability to infect a wide range of different animals and usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, however they can also cause severe respiratory infections as well as gastrointestinal and central nervous system diseases. Coronaviruses circulate among humans and animals such as bats, pigs, camels, and cats 1 . Recent zoonoses include SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged in November 2002 and became effectively extinct by 2004 [2] [3] [4] [5] . Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was believed to be transmitted from an animal reservoir in camels in 2012 6 . In veterinary terms, CoV such as porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV) causes an extremely high fatality rate in piglets 7 . SARS-CoV-2 emerged from China in 2019 8, 9 and was declared a pandemic during the first quarter of 2020 with an extremely high requirement for a vaccine to be provided in a short timeframe. Spike protein is a multifunctional viral protein found on the outside of the virus particle. It initially binds a host cell receptor though its S1 subunit and fuses viral and host membranes through its S2 subunit.",

DL has its roots in Rosenblatt's Perceptron neural network of 1957-1960 13 . DL algorithms use multiple layers to progressively extract higher level features from raw input. Many different architectures of neural network exist, and for the most part are involved in applications with image recognition. Some recent uses of DL include self-driving cars and robots; with creative projects using DL to compose music, create novel art from different styles of art and write 'fake news'. The recent advent of much increased processing power and availability in the shape of graphical processing units (GPUs), and CUDA architecture from Nvidia, have paved the way for a renewed interest in machine learning and DL algorithms.",

Therefore, the seed text provided SARS-like hits in several but not all cases. Once the initial predicted protein is finished, the prediction commences a new protein again immediately if the maximum number of characters has not been reached. Therefore, in some cases there were hybrid matches to parts of sequence from spike proteins in the dataset. Some sequences were definitively of interest to this study, such as a synthesized protein with 97% full length identity to a Bat beta-coronavirus sequence isolated from Chaerephon plicata in Yunnan in 2011 32. Further sequences of interest included those with high identity over stretches of the protein sequence to SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2, particularly those including hybrid regions. This dataset is provided with the model and source (as described below). With the study of the most relevant sequences of 2020, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 in mind, a much larger dataset of 1000 simulated sequences was generated with the same SARS-CoV seed text as previously. These simulated sequences were clustered with cd-hit and clusters corresponding to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 were aligned together with examples of the real spike proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Alignments were sliced in Biopython to remove extra sequences at the ends and the seed text at the start. The resulting multiple sequence alignment is shown in Supplementary  Figure 2 . This alignment indicates that residues important in human ACE2 recognition 33 are broadly conserved across the simulated sequences.",

The novel sequences share features that can be searched with bioinformatics tools to bring out highly significant BLAST matches and Pfam domain matches. That each of the sequences examined had BLAST and Pfam matches to Spike protein is exciting and warrants further consideration. Interestingly, in an example of a very accurate alignment, the prediction query was able to fill in a blank amino acid (G) where one was called as X in the real sequence that exactly matched other sequences of that type. It is to be noted that the generation of very large numbers of these synthesized sequences from the trained data is trivial and many thousands can be further generated and examined from the model (model & source code available at: https://github.com/LCrossman).",

However, it is to be noted that the training set is only as comprehensive as the initial database, animal CoV sequences may exist elsewhere that are not present in our database. Additionally, biases may exist, for example, the training set is overrepresented in MERS sequences and these are also heavily represented in the random simulated sequences. In some cases the resultant protein may not represent a viable protein (there could be stability or other issues). One additional potential issue could be that the premise is difficult to test.",
