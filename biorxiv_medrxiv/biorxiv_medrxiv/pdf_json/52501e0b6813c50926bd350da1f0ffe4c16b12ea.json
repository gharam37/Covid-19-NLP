To identify the early events underlying the rapid spread of the virus in the NYC metropolitan area, we sequenced the virus causing COVID19 in patients seeking care at the Mount Sinai Health System. Phylogenetic analysis of 84 distinct SARS-CoV2 genomes indicates multiple, independent but isolated introductions mainly from Europe and other parts of the United States. Moreover, we find evidence for community transmission of SARS-CoV2 as suggested by clusters of related viruses found in patients living in different neighborhoods of the city.",

Between March 9-14, screening capacity at the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) was greatly expanded, leading to a surge of newly diagnosed cases (Figure 1) . Within one week, the number of daily positive SARS-CoV-2 tests exceeded the normal volume of positive tests for influenza virus by a factor of 5. We sequenced 90 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from multiple clinical isolates taken from 84 of the >800 cases identified up to March 18, yielding 72 complete and 18 partial (>95% coverage) genomes. These cases were drawn from 21 NYC neighborhoods across four boroughs (Manhattan, Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn), as well as two towns in Westchester County. Sequenced isolates were obtained directly from nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from 44 females (52.4%) and 40 (47.7%) males ranging in age between 20-44 years (16%), 45-64 years (33%), 65-79 years (27.4%), and >80 (16.7%) years. Of the 68 cases with available hospital visit information, 12 were discharged (17.6%), 53 were admitted (80%), and 3 were initially discharged and later admitted on a subsequent visit (2.4%).",

Despite their diverse origins, many sequences in this clade are highly similar or identical, which makes it impossible to resolve direct relationships or directionality between them. By placing the ML phylogeny on a time scale, we inferred a period of untracked global transmission between late January to mid-February, consistent with epidemiological observations of the developing pandemic. The earliest sequences at the base of clade A2a include isolates from Italy, Finland, Spain, France, the UK, and other European countries from late February, in addition to a few North American isolates (Canada and US) from the first week of March 2020. Similar to isolates in clade A2a, isolates in our study positioned in clade A1a (6%) were interspersed among isolates from multiple regions with unknown directionality (Figure 2B) .",

Over the past months it has rapidly spread across the globe and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Targeted screening of suspected coronavirus disease 2019 cases, as well as a series of successive nation-wide travel restrictions were put in place to curtail SARS-CoV-2 introductions into the USA from outbreak hotspots in China (January 31, 2020), Iran (February 29, 2020), mainland European countries (March 11, 2020) , and the UK and Ireland (March 14, 2020) to the continental United States. Despite these measures, the first SARS-CoV-2 case in New York State was identified in New York City (NYC) on February 29, 2020. Following a large expansion of screening capacity in the first weeks of March the number of cases rapidly increased, and as of April 5, 2020, there were 122,031 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in NY state, including 67,551 (51%) in NYC (NY State Department of Health (NYS DOH); https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/). With more than 3,000 fatalities in the metropolitan area, NYC has become one of the major epicenters of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the USA.",

Here we present the genomic diversity of 90 SARS-CoV-2 isolates obtained from 84 patients seeking care at the Mount Sinai Health System between February 29, 2020 and March 18, 2020. These genomes provide clear evidence for multiple, independent SARS-CoV-2 introductions into NYC during the first weeks of March. Based on genetic similarity and phylogenetic analysis of fulllength viral genome sequences, most cases diagnosed during the 18 days after the first-reported case appear to be associated with untracked transmission and potential travel-related exposures. Cases with a history of travel exposure showed no evidence of onward transmission, supporting the efficacy of self-quarantine measures. Notably, the majority of introductions appear to have been sourced from Europe and the USA. We also identified two clusters totaling 21 closely related cases suggesting community spread. These observations are also supported by the city-wide distribution of these cases, which mapped to three of four represented NYC boroughs and five NY State Counties. Our data provide insight into the limited efficacy of travel restrictions for preventing spread of SARS-CoV2 infections in NYC, and point to the increased risk of community driven transmission within the larger metropolitan area.",

NYC isolates were distributed throughout the phylogenetic tree; consistent with multiple independent introductions. We assigned each SARS-CoV2 isolate to main monophyletic clades based on amino acid and nucleotide substitutions and statistical support (see Methods). These mutations were used only for the purpose of classification, as the functional impact of many of these substitutions remains unknown. For each assigned clade, we identified different types of events according to the position of the NYC sequences and available epidemiological information ( Table 1 ). The first isolate had documented exposure through travel to the Middle East (clade A3) and the second through travel to Europe (clade B). Neither of these showed evidence of onward transmission, so we therefore excluded these two cases from any inference made from the phylogenetic analyses. For the remaining isolates, the great majority (87%) cluster with clade A2a. This clade is largely composed of isolates obtained from patients with COVID19 in Europe (72%; Figure 2B ), suggesting that introductions from Europe account for the majority of cases found in NYC in the first weeks of March 2020. 5 clade is also largely composed of European-origin isolates (82%) where many of the early isolates at the base of the clade are from the UK.",

Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from around 10% of the patients diagnosed with COVID19 at the largest healthcare system of NYC during the first weeks of March provides unexpected insights into the origin and diversity of this new viral pathogen. We find clear evidence for multiple independent introductions into the larger metropolitan area from different origins in the world as well as the USA. These early introductions failed to seed larger clusters suggesting that early quarantine, hospitalization and contact tracing in the early days limited further spread. With increased testing, we observed the emergence of community acquired infections with the majority of the community cases caused by viral isolates from clades that are of European origin.",

For a specimen result to be positive for SARS-CoV-2, all three coronavirus reactions (N1, N2, N3) were required to be positive (Ct < 38), regardless of the quantity of RNaseP detected. A result was deemed negative if all three reactions failed to detect the product (Ct \u2265 38) and there was sufficient input (e.g., RNaseP Ct < 35). A result was deemed inconclusive if one or two of the three failed to amplify (Ct \u2265 38). A result was deemed invalid if all three coronavirus reactions were negative and if there was evidence of insufficient input (e.g., RNaseP Ct \u2265 35).

Branches are colored according to the region of origin, tip names are colored according to their source indicating the position of NY sequences in red (this study), blue (other NY sequences) and grey (other). Tip circles indicate NY state County assigned from zip code information (this study) and metadata from GISAID submissions. Clades that contain NY sequences and putative community spread clusters are highlighted with different colors where the grey shade on top of clade A2a indicates the position of the NY local transmission cluster (see main text for clade definition). The 90% confidence interval of the inferred time of the most recent common ancestor is indicated for the root and statistically supported nodes (>70% bootstrap values) related to sequenced isolates from NYC.",
