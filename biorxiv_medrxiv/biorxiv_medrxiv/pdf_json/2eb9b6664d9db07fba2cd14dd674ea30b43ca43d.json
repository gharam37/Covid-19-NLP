In an unprecedented collective effort, massive amounts of data are now being collected worldwide to estimate the immediate and long-term impact of this pandemic on the health system and the global economy. However, the precise timeline of the disease, its transmissibility, and the effect of mitigation strategies remain incompletely understood. Here we integrate a global network model with a local epidemic SEIR model to quantify the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States. For the outbreak in China, in n = 30 provinces, we found a latent period of 2.56\u00b10.72 days, a contact period of 1.47\u00b10.32 days, and an infectious period of 17.82\u00b12.95 days. We postulate that the latent and infectious periods are disease-specific, whereas the contact period is behavior-specific and can vary between different provinces, states, or countries. For the early stages of the outbreak in the United States, in n = 50 states, we adopted the disease-specific values from China, and found a contact period of 3.38\u00b10.69 days. Our network model predicts that-without the massive political mitigation strategies that are in place today-the United states would have faced a basic reproduction number of 5.3\u00b10.95 and a nationwide peak of the outbreak",

The cause of the disease was identified as the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2 [16] . Infection with the virus can be asymptomatic or can result in a mild to severe symptomatic disease, coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19. The majority of COVID-19 cases result in mild symptoms including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and respiratory distress [20] . Severe complications arise when the disease progresses to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure. The SARS-CoV-2 virus can spread quickly, mainly during close contact, but also through small droplets from coughing or sneezing [32] . After the first four cases were reported on December 29, the outbreak quickly spread from Wuhan across all provinces of mainland China, and, in the following two months, across the entire world. On March 11, 2020 , the World Health Organization acknowledged the alarming levels of spread and severity, and characterized the COVID-19 situation as At day 0, a fraction of the susceptible population is exposed to the virus. At day 3, exposed individuals become infectious, and the infectious period lasts for 10 days. At day 5, infectious individuals become symptomatic; the majority of the symptomatic population recovers after 9 days. At day 9, a fraction of the symptomatic population is hospitalized; the majority of the hospitalized population recovers after 14 days. At day 10, a fraction of the hospitalized population experiences critical conditions that last for 10 days and end in either recovery or in death. On the population level, the outbreak of COVID-19 can be summarized in eight curves that illustrate the dynamics of the individual subgroups.",

            "text": "The first mathematical models for infectious diseases date back to a smallpox model by Daniel Bernoulli in 1760 [4] . Since the 1920s, compartment models have become the most common approach to model the epidemiology of infectious diseases [21] . One of the simplest compartment models is the SEIR model that represents the timeline of a disease through four compartments, the susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered populations [2] . The temporal evolution of these compartments is governed by a set of ordinary differential equations parameterized in terms of the transition rates between them [18] . The transition rates \u03b1 from the exposed to the infectious state and \u03b3 from the infectious to the recovered state are disease specific parameters. In fact, they are the inverses of the latent period A = 1/\u03b1, the time during which an individual is exposed but not yet infectious, and the infectious period C = 1/\u03b3, the time during which an individual can infect others. This suggests that these two parameters are relatively independent of country, region, or city. In the example of Figure 1 , the latent and infectious periods are A = 3 days and C = 10 days [17] . The most critical feature of the model is the transition from the susceptible to the exposed state. This transition is typically assumed to scale with the susceptible population S, the infectious population I, and the contact rate \u03b2, the inverse of the contact period B = 1/\u03b2, between them [23] .",

The basic reproduction number is a measure of the contagiousness or transmissibility of an infectious agent and it can vary considerably between different infectious diseases [10] . Typical basic reproduction numbers are on the order of 18 for measles, 9 for chickenpox, 7 for mumps, 7 for rubella, and 5 for poliomyelitis [1] . When the basic reproduction number is larger than one, R 0 > 1.0, the infectious period C is larger than the contact period B [23] . This implies that at onset of an epidemic outbreak, when the entire population is susceptible, an infected individual will infect more than one other individual. In agreement with Figure 1 , the infectious population first increases, then reaches a peak, and decreases toward zero [21] . As more and more individuals transition from the susceptible through the exposed and infectious states into the recovered state, the susceptible populations decreases.

            "text": "The first mathematical models for infectious diseases date back to a smallpox model by Daniel Bernoulli in 1760 [4] . Since the 1920s, compartment models have become the most common approach to model the epidemiology of infectious diseases [21] . One of the simplest compartment models is the SEIR model that represents the timeline of a disease through four compartments, the susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered populations [2] . The temporal evolution of these compartments is governed by a set of ordinary differential equations parameterized in terms of the transition rates between them [18] . The transition rates \u03b1 from the exposed to the infectious state and \u03b3 from the infectious to the recovered state are disease specific parameters. In fact, they are the inverses of the latent period A = 1/\u03b1, the time during which an individual is exposed but not yet infectious, and the infectious period C = 1/\u03b3, the time during which an individual can infect others. This suggests that these two parameters are relatively independent of country, region, or city. In the example of Figure 1 , the latent and infectious periods are A = 3 days and C = 10 days [17] . The most critical feature of the model is the transition from the susceptible to the exposed state. This transition is typically assumed to scale with the susceptible population S, the infectious population I, and the contact rate \u03b2, the inverse of the contact period B = 1/\u03b2, between them [23] .",

            "text": "The product of the contact rate and the infectious period defines the basic reproduction number, R 0 = \u03b2 C = C/B, the number of individuals that are infected by a single one individual in an otherwise uninfected, susceptible population [11] . The basic reproduction number is a measure of the contagiousness or transmissibility of an infectious agent and it can vary considerably between different infectious diseases [10] . Typical basic reproduction numbers are on the order of 18 for measles, 9 for chickenpox, 7 for mumps, 7 for rubella, and 5 for poliomyelitis [1] . When the basic reproduction number is larger than one, R 0 > 1.0, the infectious period C is larger than the contact period B [23] . This implies that at onset of an epidemic outbreak, when the entire population is susceptible, an infected individual will infect more than one other individual. In agreement with Figure 1 , the infectious population first increases, then reaches a peak, and decreases toward zero [21] . As more and more individuals transition from the susceptible through the exposed and infectious states into the recovered state, the susceptible populations decreases. Once a large enough fraction of a population has become immune-either through recovery from the infection or through vaccination-this group provides a measure of protection for the susceptible population and the epidemic dies out [11] . This indirect protection is called herd immunity [14] . The concept of herd immunity implies that the converged susceptible population at endemic equilibrium is always larger than zero, S \u221e > 0, and its value depends on the basic reproduction number R 0 . For a given basic reproduction number R 0 , herd immunity occurs at an immune fraction of (1 \u2212 1/R 0 ). Knowing the basic reproduction number is therefore critical to estimate the immune fraction of the population that is required to eradicate an infectious disease, for example, 94.4% for measles and 80.0% for poliomyelitis [18] .",

We weight the edges by the estimated annual incoming and outgoing passenger air travel as reported by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics [6] . We summarize the connectivity of the graph G in terms of the adjacency matrix A IJ , the frequency of travel between two states I and J, and the degree matrix D II = diag adjacency matrix A IJ defines the weighted graph Laplacian L IJ , Figure 2 illustrates the discrete graph G of the United States with N = 50 nodes and the E = 200 most travelled edges. The size and color of the nodes represent the degree D II , the thickness of the edges represents the adjacency A IJ . For our passenger travel-weighted graph, the degree ranges from 100 million in California to less than 1 million in Delaware, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming, with a mean degree ofD II = 16 million per node. We assume that the Laplacian L IJ , normalized to one and scaled by the travel coefficient \u03d1, characterizes the global spreading of COVID-19 and discretize our SEIR model on our weighted graph G. Specifically, we introduce the susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered populations S I , E I , I I , and R I as global unknowns at the I = 1, ..., N nodes of the graph G. This results in the spatial discretization of the set of equations with 4 N unknowns,",

            "text": "Unlike many other countries, China has already seen a peak of the COVID-19 outbreak and is currently not seeing a significant number of new cases. The COVID-19 outbreak data of the Chinese provinces capture all three phases, increase, peak, and decrease of the infectious population and are currently the richest dataset available to date. This dataset describes the temporal evolution of confirmed, recovered, active, and death cases starting January 22, 2020 [9] . As of April 4, there were 81,639 confirmed cases, 76,755 recovered, 1,558 active, and 3,326 deaths. From these data, we map out the temporal evolution of the infectious group I as the difference between the confirmed cases minus the recovered and deaths, and the recovered group R as the sum of the recovered and deaths in each Chinese province. To simulate the province-specific epidemiology of COVID19 with the SEIR model, we use these data to identify the latent period A = 1/\u03b1, the infectious period C = 1/\u03b3, and the contact period B = 1/\u03b2 as a direct measure of the basic reproduction number R 0 = B/C. As our sensitivity analysis in Figure 3 shows, the dynamics of the SEIR model depend critically on the initial conditions, the number of susceptible S 0 , exposed E 0 , infectious I 0 , and recovered R 0 individuals on the day the very first infectious case is reported, I 0 \u2265 1. Naturally, on this day, the recovered population is R 0 = 0. Since the exposed population is asymptomatic, its initial value E 0 is unknown. To quantify the initial exposed population E 0 , we introduce a parameter \u03c1 = E 0 /I 0 , the initial latent population [27] . It defines the fraction of exposed versus infectious individuals at day 0 and is a measure of initial hidden community spreading. The fraction of the initial susceptible population, S 0 = 1 \u2212 E 0 \u2212 I 0 \u2212 R 0 , ensures that the total population sums up to one. To map the total population of one onto the absolute number of cases for each province, we introduce the normalization parameter \u03b7 = N * /N , the affected population. It defines the fraction of the province-specific epidemic subpopulation N * relative to the province population N [29] . Altogether we identify five parameters for each province, the exposed period A = 1/\u03b1, the infectious period C = 1/\u03b3, the contact period B = 1/\u03b2 or the basic reproduction number R = C/B, the initial latent population \u03c1 = E 0 /I 0 , and the affected population \u03b7 = N * /N . We performed the parameter identification using the Levenberg-Marquardt method of least squares. In this identification process, we ignored data from secondary outbreaks [9] .",

Before identifying these parameters for the outbreaks in China and in the United States, we will illustrate their e\u21b5ects by systematically varying each parameter while keeping the other values fixed.

Decreasing the initial exposed population by a factor 10 delays the maximum by 65 days. This highlights the exponential nature of the model, which causes a constant delay for a logarithmic decrease of the exponential population, while the overall outbreak dynamics remain the same.

The highest exposed and infectious curves and the steepest susceptible and recovery curves correspond to an unconstrained infectious population I tol = 0.150 > I max = 0.121 with peak infection after 125 days. In view of the COVID-19 outbreak, the gray line tells us how drastic political counter measures need to be. A required level of containment of R 0 (t)/R 0 = 0.524 implies that we need to reduce the number of infections of a single individual by about one half. However, reducing the maximum infectious population comes at a socioeconomic price: The graphs teach us that it is possible to reach an endemic equilibrium at a smaller total number of individuals that have had the disease; yet, this endemic equilibrium would occur much later in time, for this example, after two or three years. Figure 9 summarizes the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in 30 Chinese provinces. The dots indicate the reported infectious and recovered populations, the lines highlight the simulated susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered populations. The simulations are based on a province-specific parameter identification of the latent period A, the contact period B, the infectious period C, and from both, the basic reproduction number R 0 = C/B, the fraction of the initial latent population \u03c1 = E 0 /I 0 , and the fraction of the affected population \u03b7 = N * /N for each province. These five province-specific values are reported in each graph. Notably, the province of Hubei, where the outbreak started, has seen the most significant impact with more than 60,000 cases. Naturally, in Hubei, where the first cases were reported, the fraction of the initial latent population \u03c1 is zero. Small values of \u03c1 indicate a close monitoring of the COVID-19 outbreak, with very few undetected cases at the reporting of the first infectious case. The largest value of \u03c1 = 26.4 suggests that, at the onset of the outbreak, a relatively large number of cases in the province of Shandong was undetected. The fraction of the affected population \u03b7 = N * /N is a province-specific measure for the containment of the outbreak. Naturally, this number is largest in the province of Hubei, with \u03b7 = 1.3 \u00b7 10 \u22123 , and, because of strict containment, much smaller in all other provinces. Table 1 summarizes the parameters for the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Averaged over all Chinese provinces, we found a latent period of A = 2.56 \u00b1 0.72 days, a contact period of B = 1.47\u00b10.32 days, an infectious period Figure 10 shows the dynamics of the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in the 50 states of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The dots indicate the reported cases and death, the lines highlight the simulated susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered populations. The simulations are based on a state-specific parameter identification of the contact period B that defines the basic reproduction number R 0 = C/B and of the fraction of the initial latent population \u03c1 = E 0 /I 0 at a given outbreak delay d 0 for each state. These three state-specific values are reported in each graph. Since the outbreak is currently still in its early stages, we do not attempt to identify the latent and infectious periods, but rather adopt the mean latent and infectious periods A = 2.56 and C = 17.82 from the Chinese outbreak in Table 1 . Notably, the state of New York is currently seeing the most significant impact with more than 100,000 cases. Naturally, in Washington, Illinois, California, and Arizona where the first cases were reported, the fraction of the initial latent population \u03c1 is small. Largest \u03c1 values occur in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, and Louisiana. The largest basic reproduction numbers R 0 are identified in Idaho, Puerto Rico, Pennsylvania, and Indiana. Table 2 .

The simulation uses latent, contact, and in-fectious periods of A = 2.56 days, B = 3.38\u00b10.69 days, and C = 17.82 days from Table 1 and a fraction of the initial latent population of \u03c1 = E 0 /I 0 = 43.75 from Table 2. The orange curve suggests, that the individual states will see a peak of the infectious population at a mean of 39 days after the first infectious case has been reported. The 95% confidence interval suggests that this peak will occur between 4 and 6 weeks after the first reported case provided no additional counter measures are implemented. Figure 12 illustrates the outbreak delay d 0 across the United States. The first reported case was in the state of Washington on January 21, 2020, followed by cases in Illinois with a delay of d 0 = 3, California with d 0 = 4, and Arizona with d 0 = 5, shown in blue. The final states to see an outbreak were Alabama, Idaho, Montana with d 0 = 52 and West Virginia with d 0 = 56, shown in red.

These values agree with the reported incubation period of 5.1 days found in 181 confirmed COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan [22] and 5.2 days for the first 425 cases in Wuhan [24] . The total duration from exposure to recovery, (A + C) of our SEIR model, is 20.3 days, 5.3 days shorted than the reported value of 25.6 for the 391 Shenzhen cases [5] . In our model, the reported 4.8 to 5.2 day incubation periods maps onto the latent period A of 2.5 days plus 2.3 to 2.7 days within the infectious period C during which the individuals are infectious but still asymptomatic. This period is critical since individuals can spread the disease without knowing it. The contact tracing study postulates that the infectious period C begins on day 4.8 with the onset of symptoms, 2.3 days later than in our model, and ends on day 7.3 or 9.4 with or without active contract tracing with the beginning of isolation, 13.0 or 10.9 days earlier than in our model.

The basic reproduction number significantly affects the peak of the infectious population both in time and magnitude. The early outbreak data for the infectious populations of all 50 United States in Figure 10 suggest that the contact period is for 3.4 days, resulting in a basic reproduction number of 5.3. For the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the basic reproduction number was estimated to 2.2 [24] and for the 391 cases in Shenzhen, it was 2.6 [5] . A review of the reported basic reproduction numbers for COVID-19 found ranges from 1.40 to 6.49 with a mean of 3.28, values that are larger than those reported for the SARS coronavirus [25] . Huge variations of R 0 values are not uncommon [11] ; even for simple diseases like the measles, reported R 0 values vary between 3.7 and 203.3 [10] . Community mitigation and political action can modulate the basic reproduction number R 0 by a variety of measures including active contact tracing, isolation of infectious individuals, quarantine of close contacts, travel restrictions, physical distancing, or total lock down [13] . Importantly, many of the reported values already include the effect of isolation [24] and active contact tracing and quarantine [5] . If we correct our identified basic reproduction number for China in Figure 9 and Table 1 by reducing our identified infectious period of 17.8 days to the time prior to isolation using the correction factors of 6.6 and 3.9 with and without contact tracing, our R 0 values for China would be 1.91 and 3.23 and fall well within the reported range [25] . Our R 0 value for the United States of 5.30 agrees well with the range of values reported for mathematical model ranging from 1.50 to 6.49 with a mean of 4.20 early isolated population in Shenzhen [5] . This comparison suggests that it is critical to understand how the infectious period is reported, either as a disease-specific parameter or as a medically-modulated exposure time.",

The basic reproduction number significantly affects the peak of the infectious population both in time and magnitude. The early outbreak data for the infectious populations of all 50 United States in Figure 10 suggest that the contact period is for 3.4 days, resulting in a basic reproduction number of 5.3. For the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the basic reproduction number was estimated to 2.2 [24] and for the 391 cases in Shenzhen, it was 2.6 [5] . A review of the reported basic reproduction numbers for COVID-19 found ranges from 1.40 to 6.49 with a mean of 3.28, values that are larger than those reported for the SARS coronavirus [25] . Huge variations of R 0 values are not uncommon [11] ; even for simple diseases like the measles, reported R 0 values vary between 3.7 and 203.3 [10] . Community mitigation and political action can modulate the basic reproduction number R 0 by a variety of measures including active contact tracing, isolation of infectious individuals, quarantine of close contacts, travel restrictions, physical distancing, or total lock down [13] . Importantly, many of the reported values already include the effect of isolation [24] and active contact tracing and quarantine [5] . If we correct our identified basic reproduction number for China in Figure 9 and Table 1 by reducing our identified infectious period of 17.8 days to the time prior to isolation using the correction factors of 6.6 and 3.9 with and without contact tracing, our R 0 values for China would be 1.91 and 3.23 and fall well within the reported range [25] . Our R 0 value for the United States of 5.30 agrees well with the range of values reported for mathematical model ranging from 1.50 to 6.49 with a mean of 4.20 [25] . Understanding the natural value of R 0 -without any mitigation strategy-is critical to predict the endemic equilibrium, interpret herd immunity, and the estimate the fraction of the population that requires vaccination [18] .",

As we can see in Figures 6, 7 , and 8, we can achieve this goal by reducing the basic reproduction number R 0 = C/B, which is a direct signature of effective containment measures and drastic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population [13] . By isolating infectious individuals, active contact tracing, and quarantining close contacts, we can reduce the effective infectious period C; and by implementing travel restrictions, mandating physical distancing, or enforcing total lock down, we can increase the contact period B [27] . Figure 9 demonstrates that combinations of these measures have successfully flattened the curves in the 30 provinces of China [24] . But the million-dollar questions remains: What's next? In the very near future, our model has the potential to predict the timeline of the outbreak, specifically, the timing and peak of the infectious population in individual states and countries. This will help us optimize planning and distribute medical resources where needed [17] . In the short term, we could enhance our model to study the effect of different subgroups of the population [5] . This could provide scientific guidelines to gradually relax political measures, for example by releasing different subgroups of the population before others. In the long term, we will need accurate values of the basic reproduction number to estimate the effect of vaccination. This will be critical to design rigorous vaccination programs and prioritize which subgroups of the population to vaccinate first [18] . Naturally, as more data become available, we can train our models more reliably and make more accurate predictions.",

While this allows us to estimate the peaks of the outbreak in space and time, we need to be aware that this study uses a simple model to characterize a complex infectious disease about which we still know very little to this day. Importantly, we have to be cautious not to overstate the results. Specifically, our study has several limitations: First, our mathematical model does not account for asymptomatic cases. Little is known about the fraction of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals but early studies suggest that up to 25% of individuals have gone from susceptible to recovered without having ever been reported as infectious. Second, the classical SEIR model does not distinguish between asymptomatic infectious in the first days of the disease and symptomatic infectious in the later days. Knowing more about this group and modeling appropriately is critical to accurately estimate the impact of community spreading and mitigation strategies to reduce it. Third, while the initial infectious group I 0 can be reasonably well approximated from the reported active cases and the initial recovered group R 0 is likely zero, the initial exposed group E 0 is really unknown and can hugely effect the outbreak dynamics as the sensitivity study in Figure 3 and the data for China and the United States in Figures 9 and 10 show. We decided to include this effect through the initial latent population \u03c1 to highlight this effect, but more data are needed to better estimate the size of this group. Fourth and probably most importantly, the major variable we can influence through social and political measures is the basic reproduction number R 0 , or rather the interplay of the contact period B and infectious period C. Obviously, we do not know the true R 0 , nor can we measure it at this stage of the outbreak, where every state, province, or country has implemented different measures to modulate the local outbreak dynamics. Nonetheless, our study shows that estimating R 0 is important to quantify if and how different political counter measures work and to predict the timeline of the infectious population under no, moderate, and massive political action. Finally, our network model only provides rough mobility estimates from air travel statistics. To more accurately simulate the spreading of COVID-19, we could gradually refine our network and include more granular mobility patterns, for example from cell phone data.",

Here we combined data from the outbreak in China with data from the early stages of the outbreak in the United States to identify the latent, contact, and infectious periods and the basic reproduction number of COVID-19. To quantify the outbreak dynamics, we integrated a global network model with a local epidemic SEIR model and solved the resulting set of coupled nonlinear equations using a Newton-Raphson scheme. For the outbreak in China, in n = 30 provinces, we found a latent period of 2.6 days, a contact period of 1.5 days, and an infectious period of 17.8 days. For the early stages of the outbreak in the United States, in n = 50 states, we found a contact period of 3.4 days and a travel coefficient of 0.42.

The total duration from exposure to recovery, (A + C) of our SEIR model, is 20.3 days, 5.3 days shorted than the reported value of 25.6 for the 391 Shenzhen cases[5]. In our model, the reported 4.8 to 5.2 day incubation periods maps onto the latent period A of 2.5 days plus 2.3 to 2.7 days within the infectious period C during which the individuals are infectious but still asymptomatic. This period is critical since individuals can spread the disease without knowing it. The contact tracing study postulates that the infectious period C begins on day 4.8 with the onset of symptoms, 2.3 days later than in our model, and endsFig. 15 COVID-19 outbreak dynamics across the United States predicted with the SEIR network model. Exposed, infectious, and recovered cases for the United States reported and predicted by the SEIR network model using data from the early stages of the outbreak. With no additional counter measures, the SEIR network model predicts a nation-wide peak of the outbreak on day 54, on May 10, 2020. Latent period A = 2.56 days, contact period B = 3.38 days, infectious period C = 17.82 days, fraction of initial latent population \u03c1 = E 0 /I 0 = 43.75, day at which the last state reported its first case d 0 = March 17, 2020, and travel coefficient \u03d1 = 0.43.and assumes that no additional counter measures have been implemented. Days 10 and 20 illustrate the slow growth of the infectious population during the early states of the outbreak. The state of New York sees the outbreak first, followed by New Jersey and Louisiana. Days 30 and 40 illustrate how the outbreak spreads across the country. With no additional counter measures, the SEIR network model predicts a nation-wide peak of the outbreak on day 54, on May 10, 2020. Day 50 illustrates that the earlier affected states, New York, New Jersey, and Louisiana already see a decrease of the infected population. Nebraska, West Virginia, and Wisconsin are still far from reaching the peak. Compared to Figures 12 to 14 these maps account for both, the outbreak delay and the travel of individuals between the different states represented through the network model. This model would allow us to probe the effect of travel restrictions to and from a specific state by locally reducing its travel coefficients or by globally reducing the nation-wide transport coefficient across the United States.",
