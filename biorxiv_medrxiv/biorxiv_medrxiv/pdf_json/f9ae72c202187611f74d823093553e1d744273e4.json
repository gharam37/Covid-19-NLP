This system generates estimates of the current reproductive rate, R t , together with predictions of future daily deaths and clearly outperforms a number of alternative forecasting systems that have been presented recently. Our current 5 (14th April 2020) estimates for R t are, respectively, UK 0.49 (0.0 -1.02), Spain 0.55 (0.33 -0.77), Italy 0.90 (0.74 -1.06) and France 0.67 (0.40 -0.94) (mean and 95% credible intervals). Thus, we believe that the epidemics have been successfully suppressed in each of these countries, with high probability. Our approach is trivial to set up for any region and generates results in a few minutes on a laptop. We believe it would be straightforward to set up equivalent frameworks using more complex and realistic models, and hope that some experts in the field of epidemiological modelling will consider investigating this approach 10 further.",

The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method (Metropolis et al., 1953; Hammersley and Handscomb, 1964; Hastings, 1970) is particularly convenient in terms of flexibility and ease of implementation, and although it requires O(10000) model simulations, this is easily affordable for the simple model that we are using. 15 The approach we present here is based on fitting a simple homogeneous SEIR model to data. While the MCMC method (using the package 'MCMCpack' in the R language) is easy to set up and use, it seems likely that more efficient methods might be possible. In particular, it should be possible to exploit the log-linear behaviour exhibited in the dynamics to use much more efficient approaches such as Kalman Filtering, and thus we expect the principles of model calibration and initialisation demonstrated here could be readily applied to more computationally demanding models. 20 2 .

Using a prior centred on unity means that one can easily discern from the posterior predictive distribution whether the observed data are more consistent with suppression or mitigation even before the effect of the policies is known with high confidence. An alternative approach might be to use an uncertain scaling factor \u03b1 such that R t = \u03b1R 0 but the interpretation of results would be marginally less clear and the prior choice on \u03b1 slightly less natural for us.

In particular, the \"Monday dip\" in recent weeks been substantially greater than can be accounted for via sampling uncertainties alone and therefore as our second source of uncertainty we include an additional factor for these reporting errors, for which we use a Gaussian distribution with a magnitude of 20% of the expected value (again at one standard deviation). We make no attempt to either directly correct for these reporting errors or to account for their somewhat periodic and skewed nature. 15 Perhaps the most subtle and important source of model-data discrepancy is the inadequacy of the model itself. Even if the model is perfectly initialised, with the best possible choice of parameter values, it is inevitable that it will diverge from reality to a greater extent than could be accounted for by stochastic factors. There are in fact no 'true' parameters for which the model can track reality indefinitely. This failure does not just affect the forecast, but also prevents the model from 'shadowing' (Smith, 2006) an indefinitely long historic time series of observations. However, a consequence of the (log-)linear and deterministic 20 nature of the model is that, in the limit of an infinite data stream of unlimited precision, the posterior probability distribution under a standard Bayesian updating methodology will converge to a point estimate and a point forecast which therefore will not validate. This ubiquitous problem in data assimilation and parameter estimation has a number of possible solutions. Here we treat the model inadequacy in a simple way as a multiplicative error that increases linearly with time at the rate of 3% per day. This is necessarily a rather subjective approach and the calibration of this number is rather subjective. An error term of 25 1% per day or less would be too small to significantly influence results within the time scale of interest, and a value of 10% per day would render the model largely useless. As well as inflating the forecast spread, this error also grows in time backwards from the forecast time during the calibration process. What this means in practice is that observations sufficiently distant in time from the present have little influence on the calibration, and that the posterior certainty is bounded even for an unlimited time series of perfect observations.",

Therefore, we can use Sweden as a test of our system's 5 ability to detect failure or absence of controls. In this test, we assume imposition of controls in Sweden at around the same time as in the rest of Europe (17 March), and calibrate our model as before, with an assumed R t \u2208 N (1, 0.5 2 ) subsequent to that date. The results are shown in Figure 6 . These results demonstrates that the prior on R t is sufficiently vague that the data easily dominates it and generates a result showing essentially no change in the growth rate over the interval for which we have data. Our results for Sweden are also consistent with the latest forecast from MRC.

Similarly, Davies et al. (2020) used alignment with observed deaths (up to 27th March) to choose the starting date of their model simulations, but do not appear to have considered calibrating the growth rate even though by that time it must have been apparent to all researchers that the empirical rate was very much at the high end of all prior expectations. It seems extremely remiss that 5 such simple calibration is not performed routinely, and it may well have played a significant r\u00f6le in the tardy and complacent response of the UK government in the early stages of the epidemic. Compared to the expert prediction of a 5-day doubling time, simple modelling suggests that the 3-day doubling that has been widely observed will, in the absence of strong controls on behaviour, result in the peak of the epidemic being roughly a month earlier and twice as high, resulting in a hugely increased demand on healthcare resources while giving far less time to prepare. Coincident with this, the higher implied value for R also 10 makes the epidemic rather harder to control. We urge epidemiological modellers to consider more seriously the calibration and initialisation of their models when attempting to provide policy-relevant guidance.",

We have shown that this method generates valid 15 forecasts and an initial assessment of its performance shows it to be rather more reliable than the forecasts generated by both the MRC/IC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We suggest that these centers, and others like them, might like to consider the potential of model calibration for improving their forecasts.",
