The resulting disease, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019), soon became a pandemic. This study aims to characterize key attributes of the epidemiology of this infection in China. Methods: An age-stratified mathematical model was constructed to describe the transmission dynamics and estimate the age-specific differences in the biological susceptibility to the infection, age-assortativeness in transmission mixing, case fatality rate (CFR), and transition in rate of infectious contacts (and reproduction number 0 R ) following introduction of mass interventions. Results: The model estimated the infectious contact rate in early epidemic at 0.59 contacts per day (95% uncertainty interval (UI)=0.48-0.71). Relative to those 60-69 years of age, susceptibility to the infection was only 0.06 in those \u226419 years, 0.34 in 20-29 years, 0.57 in 30-39 years, 0.69 in 40-49 years, 0.79 in 50-59 years, 0.94 in 70-79 years, and 0.88 in \u226580",

            "text": "The model was parameterized using current data on COVID-19 natural history and epidemiology. The duration of latent infection was set at 3.69 days based on an existing estimate [12] and based on a median incubation period across confirmed cases of 5.1 days [1] , adjusted for the observed viral load among infected persons following exposure [13] and reported infection transmission prior to onset of symptoms [14] . The age-stratified proportions of infected individuals that will eventually progress to develop mild, severe, or critical infections were based on the observed distribution of cases across these infection stages in China [3, 15, 16] . The duration of infectiousness was assumed to last for 3.48 days based on an existing estimate [12] and based on the observed time to recovery in persons with mild infection [3, 12] and the observed viral load among infected persons [13, 14] . Individuals with severe (or critical) infections develop severe (or critical) disease over a period of 28 days prior to recovery, as informed by the observed duration from onset of severe (or critical) disease to recovery [3] . Individuals with critical disease had the additional risk of disease mortality [17] . The disease mortality rate was fitted factoring the observed crude case fatality rate in each age group in China as of February 11, 2020 [2, 17] .",

The rate of infectious contacts can be expressed roughly as c p \u00d7 , where c is the number of \"social\" contacts conducive to COVID-19 transmission per day and p is the transmission probability of the virus in a single contact. While p is unknown, it is possibly in the order of 1-5%, as suggested by contact tracing data from China-1-5% of contacts were subsequently laboratoryconfirmed as COVID-19 cases [3] . This implies that, on average, each infected person had somewhere between 10-60 contacts per day at the beginning of the epidemic, but very few contacts after the lockdown. The latter further affirms the role of the lockdown in severely cutting the contact rate, making sustainable infection transmission very difficult.",
