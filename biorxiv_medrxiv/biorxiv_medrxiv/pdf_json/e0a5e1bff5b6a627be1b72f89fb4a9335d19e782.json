Generalized additive models with quasi-Poisson distribution was first fitted to estimate city-specific effects of PM 10 and PM 2.5 on daily confirmed COVID-19 cases while controlling AT, AH and MSI. Then, we used meta-analysis to generate the pooled effect estimates from city-specific results.",

Similar trend was also found in different cumulative lag days (from lag 01 to lag 07 and lag 014).

Meanwhile, because of evidently influence of meteorological factors in COVID-19 transmission (Wang et al. 2020b; Oliveiros et al. 2020 ) we chose to control meteorological factors and MSI in our models to clarify the associations between COVID-19 case counts and airborne PM pollution. After controlling these factors, we found both PM 2.5 and PM 10 were positively related to the COVID-19 confirmed cases, suggesting the airborne PM pollution might affect the COVID-19 transmission. This was similar to other studies focusing on the influenza and SARS. A study conducted in 47 Chinese cities has found that ambient PM 2.5 may increase the risk of exposure to influenza in China especially during days with low temperature ). Croft etc. have found that short-term increases in traffic and other combustion sources-related PM 2.5 might contribute to the increased rates of influenza hospitalizations (Croft et al. 2020 . By conducting an ecologic study, Cui etc. found that case fatality rate of SARS in 5 regions increased with the increment of air pollution index (API) and those patients in regions with higher API suffered greater risks of death(Y e t a l .",

To our knowledge, no studies have reported the associations between COVID-19 confirmed case counts and particulate pollution in cities across China. As of March 2 nd , 2020, we collected a total of 24 939 confirmed cases from 72 cities in China and found positive relationships between PM 2.5 and PM 10 and COVID-19 cases after controlling meteorological factors and population migration.",
