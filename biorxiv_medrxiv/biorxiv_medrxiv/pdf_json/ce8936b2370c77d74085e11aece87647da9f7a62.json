According to a COVID-19 Community Mobility Report informed by Google this reduction was intensified and spread to other settings since the local government declared a state of emergency (8) . This report suggested that intervention was effectively applied, and it is consistent with the transmissibility reduction observed. Furthermore, uor study indicated that social distancing measures impact should be monitored on daily based using hospitalized SARI cases, especially during the shortage of the COVID-19 confirmatory tests.",
