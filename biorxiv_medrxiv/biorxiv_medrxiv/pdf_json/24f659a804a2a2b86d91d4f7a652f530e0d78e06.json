The peak of the epidemics has not yet been reached and it is expected to be delayed in Central and Southern Italian regions compared to Northern ones. We have modeled the Covid-19 outbreak progression in Italian Regions vs. Lombardy. Methods. In our models, we have estimated the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) -which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection -both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period and also by using day by day assessment, based on single observations. We used the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading of the pandemic in Italy. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. h  a  s  n  o  t  y  e  t  b  e  e  n  r  e  a  c  h  e  d  .

The method is based on non-linear least square framewo for intrinsic growth estimation , in order to obtain with M the Laplace transforming probability distribution of the serial interval of the infection. The estimation is obtained with 100 susceptibility for 2019-nCoV at the early stage in Wuhan as reported in [7] .

According to our model and Piedmont, Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Marche reach an R 0 value up to 4. The R 0 is 3.7 for Lazio and 3.6 for Campania region, where this latter shows the highest value among the Southern Italian regions, followed by Apulia (3.5), Sicily (3.4), Abruzzo (3.4), Calabria (3.1), Basilicata (2.5) and Molise (2.4). The value of R 0 is decreasing in Lombardy and Northern Regions, while it is increasing in Central and Southern Regions. Conclusion. The expected peak of SEIR model can be forecast by the last week of March at national level, and by the first weeks of April in Southern Italian Regions. These kind of models can be useful for adoption of all the possible preventive measures, and to assess the epidemics progression across Southern regions as opposed to the Northern ones.",
