Hence, there is a chance of no secondary reinfections from the recovered population as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes, that is, = 0.",

In his study, Nesteruk (2020) used the popular SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed) model to obtain optimal values for the model parameters with the use of statistical approach and hence predicated the number of infected, susceptible and removed persons versus time. This model approach by Nesteruk (2020) has been a major breakthrough in modelling disease control as used by several authors (Ming and Zhang, (2020) and Victor (2020) among others). However, although there exist a global interest in knowing the rate of infection that will occur over time globally, in this study we adopt solutions from Victor (2020) and Victor and Oduwole (2020) for a new deterministic endemic model (Susceptible -Exposed -Infectious -Removed -Undetectable -Susceptible: SEIRUS) originally developed for the control of the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Africa.",

This implies that as a pandemic as declared by WHO (2020) the COVID-19 coronavirus does not have a curative vaccine yet and precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and observatory procedures. The basic reproductive number was found to be 0 = 0 and hence shows that there is a high chance of no secondary infections from the recovered population as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes, that is, = 0.",

            "text": "Furthermore, numerical simulations were carried to complement the analytical results in investigating the effect of the implementation of quarantine and observatory procedures has on the projection of the further spread of the virus globally. Result shows that the proportion of infected population in the absence of curative vaccination will continue to grow globally meanwhile the recovery rate will continue slowly which therefore means that the ratio of infection to recovery rate will determine the death rate that is recorded globally and most significant for this study is the rate of reinfection by the recovered population which will decline to zero over time as the virus is cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class.. However, unless there is a dedicated effort from individual population, government, health organizations, policy makers and stakeholders, the world would hardly be reed of the COVID-19 coronavirus and further spread is eminent and the rate of infection will continue to increase despite the increased rate of recovery until a curative vaccine is developed. .
