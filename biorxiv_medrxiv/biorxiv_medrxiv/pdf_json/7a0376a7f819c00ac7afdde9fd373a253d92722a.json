SOFA was developed primarily for use in hospitalized sepsis. It has one respiratory measurement: the PaO2/FIO2 ratio. The other five measures document deterioration in other organ systems. Published data consistently report many COVID-19 patients did not develop multi organ failure during the Intensive Care Unit stay [7] [8] [9] . US and European colleagues treating COVID-19 patients confirm that many deaths are from primary respiratory, not multiple system, failure 10 . SOFA scores for triage in a COVID-19 pandemic may then not discriminate who would benefit from intubation and only be useful late in a patient's course, after they have received multiple days or weeks of mechanical ventilation. More so, since COVID-19 patients will presumably have lower SOFA score at the time of intubation compared to septic patients they will be allocated a ventilator even though current articles report a significantly higher mortality 7, 11 .",

(MDN) Phoenix ICU database. Phoenix provides data critical to research efforts such as the development of TACS as well as providing insight and understanding to clinicians and administrators making front line decisions that impact patient care. The dataset provided by MDN for the development of TACS consists of 3,301 de-identified admissions admitted to 41 adult ICUs. To qualify, an ICU had to send electronically captured vital signs to MDN. These ICUs were situated in the Southeast, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Pacific West regions. Patients had to be 18 years and above and have one of the following admitting diagnoses: asthma, COPD, pneumonia (bacterial, viral, or parasitic), pulmonary edema, respiratory arrest, restrictive lung disease (fibrosis, sarcoidosis), sleep apnea, or hemorrhage/hemoptysis. Variables considered as predictors were organized as demographics, comorbidities and , pulmonary physiology parameters. Vital signs and labs were formatted dependent on methodology taken from the Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) system [12] [13] [14] . The vital signs data were aggregated into minimum and maximum value within the first 24 hours after admission (e.g. max_hr24) and within 24 and 48 hours (e.g. max_temp48). The same was carried out for albumin and ph. Based on clinical knowledge the following vitals and labs were entered into the multivariable models: Maximum heart rate Maximum respiratory rate Minimum mean arterial pressure Maximum temperature Minimum albumin Minimum pH Missing values for albumin were imputed as the median value of 2.80, while missing pH values were imputed with the median value of 7.39. None of the min/max vital signs had missing values. Along with vital signs and the two lab values, a patient's age, gender = female, square root of the length of time between hospital admission and ICU admission, (This was done to reduce the .

Another variable combined seven comorbidities indicative of immunosuppression was derived by a patient having one or more of the following comorbidities based on the APACHE methodology: AIDS, cirrhosis, leukemia, lymphoma, metastatic cancer, hepatic failure, and diabetes. Finally, interaction terms were created for age with COPD, congestive heart failure, body mass index, and male gender. All of these variables were chosen based on clinical expertise, the emerging literature describing COVID-19 cases, and descriptions provided by front-line practitioners and no addition or removal of variables was performed based on statistical significance. To account for the effects of when a patient was placed on mechanical ventilation, a variable called \"initMV\" was computed as the duration between ICU admission and hospital admission.

Finally, a cut-point probability of 0.50 was used to calculate the positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity of the model. There were three outcomes for which the above procedures were carried out: hospital mortality given labs and vital signs at 24 hours, PAMV given labs and vital signs at 24 hours, and PAMV given labs and vital signs at 48 hours. For the outcome mortality at 24 hours, only a patient's first ICU admission was included (to avoid counting one patient twice).

It was designed specifically with this pandemic in mind. We used the early reports from China and discussions with front line practitioners treating COVID-19 patients as the basis for selecting predictor variables. While it focuses on respiratory physiology parameters, it also has seven possible choices for immunosuppression among other pre-existing conditions, as these are well-documented and very important risk factors. The final model is broad enough to include all possible current and future COVID trajectories but also narrow enough to focus on death from respiratory causes such as Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). While previous attempts at developing an ARDS mortality prediction models were inferior to more general multi organ failure scores such as APACHE, those models combined a very heterogenous ARDS population 16 The model relied on age, bilirubin, hematocrit and net volume balance over 24hrs. Pneumonia severity prediction tools including respiratory parameters have maintained their predictive performance (curb-65, psi). Since current reports describe COVID-19 pneumonia as predominantly a single organ failure we decide to focus on respiratory parameters.",

A secondary use would be serial measurements to assess the trajectory of intubated patients and predict patients who will require prolonged mechanical ventilation. A third use would be to compare outcomes from various treatment strategies. We initially focused on these objectives. While earlier reports from China showed that higher SOFA scores were associated with higher mortality, all hospitalized patients were included 18 . More than half of the patients were admitted to the general wards therefore comparing non-critically ill and critically ill patients. This comparison will not be relevant in crisis situations when the selection criteria will be applied solely to critically ill patients. This is why in our model, we included patients who had an ICU stay. Other studies have used SOFA in critically ill patients but with very small samples sizes, only 9 outcomes thus questioning the validity of the analysis 19 . When analyzing 52 critically ill patients, Yang et al found the initial 24hr SOFA score was 4 in survivors compared to 6 in non-survivors 19 . The traditional cutoff for SOFA is < 6 which correlates with a mortality of 10% 20 . The findings by Yang et al reinforce the concept that early SOFA will not discriminate between survivors and non-survivors as most patients present to the ICU in single organ failure. In the study by Yang et al, the in-hospital mortality was 61.5% although the SOFA score in non-survivors predicted a mortality below 10%.",
