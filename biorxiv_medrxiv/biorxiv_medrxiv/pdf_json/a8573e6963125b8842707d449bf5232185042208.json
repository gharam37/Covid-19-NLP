Australia is currently about two weeks behind the trajectory of similar highresource nations such as the UK and the Netherlands 1,2 . This delay has been achieved through our relative geographic isolation and strong response on international travel in the initial stages, beginning with travel restrictions to China (1st February) 3 , then Iran (29 th Feb), South Korea (5 th March), and Italy (11 th March) 4 . However, failure to identify emerging populations as at-risk in March (e.g. returning travelers from the US and the cruise ship the Ruby Princess) allowed a number of people to enter the country without testing for or awareness of infection with COVID-19. This finally led to an advisory against all non-essential travel for all countries on 20 th March 2020. Despite this strong stance, on 25 th March 2020, Australia surpassed China as the country with highest number of daily notified COVID-19 cases in the Western Pacific Region. Now that sustained local transmission rivals importation as the main driver of new COVID-19 cases (including local transmission among people who are unaware that they are infected) there is a need for all Australians to change their behaviour. In this context, we need to examine just how stringent social distancing measures need to be to avoid most of our population becoming infected, and the associated loss of life.",

Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient fraction of the population is immune to allow the effective reproduction number to fall below one.

A recent study by Ferguson et al of Imperial College suggests that even by modifying the transmission rate by public health interventions that combine home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of those living in the same household as suspect cases, and social distancing of the elderly and others at most risk of severe disease (i.e., a mitigation strategy), the UK would still experience an epidemic which would overwhelm current health services many times over 6 . Applying these results directly to Australia's national or jurisdictional demography is similarly alarming 8 . Therefore a much expanded effort to control the epidemic has been advocated. Achieving a \"suppression strategy\", which would bring the reproduction number below one, would require a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of identified cases and household quarantine of their family members as a minimum effort 6 . This model was specified for the UK and US based on demography and detailed agent-based features, such as having specific country-level representation of transmission in households, schools, workplaces, and the wider community 9 .",

At the peak, 3% of the population would be symptomatic. Around 57% of the population would be expected to be infected by the end of the epidemic.",

We applied the concepts of mitigation and suppression to the Australian COVID-19 epidemic, calibrated to our current epidemic curve as at 27 th March 2020. Our results show that with a reproduction number of 2.4 and in the absence of a response to the epidemic, we can expect the majority of Australians to be infected by the end of winter 2020, with a peak expected in early July. Mitigation measures, as simulated in Scenario 2, dramatically reduce the rate of upswing of the epidemic curve, and delay its peak until early November. However, mitigation measures that only reduce the reproduction number to 1.6 have only a modest effect on the final number of people infected. Aiming for herd immunity and slowing the epidemic peak by 5 to 6 months will still overwhelm the health system (albeit by about 7-fold rather, than 16-fold) and the associated excess deaths would be unthinkable. We could do our best to protect the elderly from the illness to reduce deaths, but it is unlikely that we could avoid enormous numbers of fatalities even with moderate strategies in place that reduce the reproduction number to 1.6. On the other hand, slightly more stringent measures that reduce the reproduction number to 1.2 and maintain ICU case numbers below current capacity would extend the duration of the epidemic for more than two years, which seems an impractical strategy.",

These two settings have taken very different approaches, with South Korea conducting high numbers of tests (around 40 tests for every confirmed case) 14 , while Hubei has used travel restrictions and universal social distancing with home lockdown 15 . Singapore and Japan have taken different paths to China, in relying primarily on test and manage tactics with cancellation of some major events, but continuation of work, schools and life 15 .

Fundamentally, there are only three possibilities: 1) relax restrictions and allow an epidemic with similar characteristics to the first wave, 2) maintain suppression until vaccination is possible (or indefinitely), and 3) allow limited circulation to occur while protecting the vulnerable. Each of these approaches is associated with enormous costs. For the first, in the absence of population immunity, the burden of disease and loss of life would be similar to that predicted under our Reff > 1 scenarios. For the second, it remains unclear whether suppressive measures that can maintain Reff < 1 are compatible with a functioning society and economy, while the timing of the arrival of a novel vaccine remains similarly uncertain. The third would require segregation of society to isolate the elderly and at-risk from controlled transmission in younger groups, which would require unprecedented changes to our social structures and/or lifestyles. Ferguson et al. explored time out periods to allow financial recovery and re-instate these measures after a threshold is again reached 6 . From an exclusively epidemiological standpoint, there is no particular reason to conclude that this would minimise the impact of interventions, but could be considered if pulsed relaxations were beneficial from a social/economic perspective, as suggested by the authors.",
