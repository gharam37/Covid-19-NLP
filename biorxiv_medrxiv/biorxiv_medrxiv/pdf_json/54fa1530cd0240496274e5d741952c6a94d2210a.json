As of April 4, 2020 , this pandemic has resulted in 1,192,028 confirmed cases and 64,316 deaths worldwide 5 . COVID-19 has caused 77 national governments around the world to impose a lockdown in part or all their countries, as of April 4, 2020 3 . However, most world jurisdictions have not achieved the containment of COVID-19. Only China Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea had appeared to be successful so far in the suppression of transmission of COVID-19. China contained the virus after social isolation measures. Despite this, a report 6 suggested that if these social interventions (non-pharmacological interventions) had been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in mainland China, cases in this region could had been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively. However, if these social interventions were instead conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later, the number of cases could have shown a 3-fold, 7-fold, and 18-fold increase, respectively. South Korea, instead, began systematically testing for the virus and isolating individuals reported to have COVID-19. Despite the success of South Korea in containing the virus, this approach may be difficult to implement in countries who lack comparable human, technological, and economical resources to support widespread case detection, contact tracing and testing.",

These interventions may suppress (lower the effective reproductive value to less than one) or mitigate (reduce the epidemic peak) the number of cases, deaths, and other adverse outcomes of COVID-19. Some of these social non-pharmacological interventions include social distance, work distance, or closure of schools and universities. Imperial College London suggested the United Kingdom could expect 510 thousand deaths without suppression or mitigation, and a reduction between 92-98% of deaths with several social interventions 4 . The report by Ferguson et al. (2020) 4 simulated an intermittent intervention that would be triggered in the United Kingdom by reaching between 60 and 400 critical care admissions in a day, under several transmission scenarios.",
