Using publicity available data I model the change in deaths probability from day 30 of outbreak until 14 th April 2020. The global trend is that this proportion is increasing and that many countries have not yet reached the maximum deaths rate. However, there are visual differences between countries and in some countries the proportions are clearly below or above the global trend. A positive correlation between deaths cases and recorded infections indicates that a higher infection number results in increased mortality numbers.",

Many countries are heavily affected by the outbreak and there is a high deaths rate [2] . The deaths probability will be an important parameter guiding how long lock-down and social distancing are necessary. Countries economies are under pressure and for older adults, who are the most vulnerable group, social distancing is predicted to come with serious negative effects [3] , but obviously spread of the disease should be condemned as much as possible until the health system can cope with the disease. Here, I analyse the death proportion dynamics of COVID-19 infections since outbreak of the disease. I focus on the change of deaths probability over confirmed cases of a particular day and if this proportion changes over time. This indicates the probability of a fatal case for the current number of cases and reflects whether further increase can be expected, or if proportions have reached the maximum. The analysis reveals that at the current number of confirmed cases, the proportion of people dying is still increasing in most countries, indicating the situation may further worsen.",

A time-series analysis was conducted to track changes over time using generalized additive mixed effects models (GAMMs) following ref. [5] . This approach smoothes changes over time tracking non-linear trends. Change in proportion and count data were modelled using `Days` as continuous variable building a global model for all countires applying a smooth term with family either binomial for proportion or poisson for count data. The change over time per country was introduced into the random effect. The models were build using the R packages nlme [6] and mgcv [7] . The change over time was smoothed using 10 knots and a cubic regression spline. Model convergence was controlled using the lmeControl function, with the maximum number of iterations set to 500 and using optimisation opt=optim function. Temporal autocorrelation was introduced to account for violation of independence.",

In China this measure doesn`t change because there are no new cases of infections, neither deaths cases recorded (Supporting Figures 1+3) , which causes no more temporal change. This indicates the maximum proportion was reached. Interestingly, in the country with most confirmed cases, the United States, the deaths proportions are lower than could be expected. Germany is reaching the global trend now, despite it has more than average confirmed cases. In Japan the deaths proportions are declining, which may be caused by the fact that there are more daily new infections than on average, but the deaths rates are increasing less than the global trend. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

Because of this I looked into correlations between confirmed cases and deaths proportion, checking for positive trends. Indeed there seems to be a positive trend that more confirmed cases result in a higher probability of fatal recordings (Fig. 2) . With more infected cases the probability to die from COVID-19 infections seems to increase. This is true for 4 different days within the last month. In line with the global analysis the correlations are all positive but slowly decrease over time.",

However, there are clear differences between countries and individual countries will have to follow individual actions to condemn the spread of the disease. While in general it looks like more infections cause more fatal cases, this is not true or all countries. Particularly in the US the deaths proportions are less increasing than might be expected. This may be either that the healths system can still cope with the cases, or confirmed cases are accumulating faster than fatal cases rise.",

Another measure could be to calculate \"Deaths cases\" over \"Open cases\". This would require to calculate daily new cases of deaths only. This is a promising future step and certainly worth following up. In this work I focus on whether countries have already reached the maximum deaths proportion and if this trend seems stabilizing over time. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

I start on looking at the proportion of deaths per confirmed cases. This measure may represent how likely deaths occurs and if the maximum is reached already.
