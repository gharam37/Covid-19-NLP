Results: A total of 21 studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect (OR = 0.35 and 95% CI = 0.24-0.51). Use of masks by healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-healthcare workers (Non-HCWs) can reduce the risk of respiratory virus infection by 80% (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.11-0.37) and 47% (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.36-0.79). The protective effect of wearing masks in Asia (OR = 0.31) appeared to be higher than that of Western countries (OR = 0.45). Masks had a protective effect against influenza viruses (OR = 0.55), SARS (OR = 0.26), and SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 0.04). In the subgroups based on different study designs, protective effects of wearing mask were significant in cluster randomized trials, case-control studies and retrospective studies. Conclusions: This study adds additional evidence of the enhanced protective value of masks, : medRxiv preprint https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.htm [45] Chan JF, Yuan S, Kok K, To KK, Chu H, Yang J, et al.

The concepts of droplet and airborne transmission that are entrenched in clinical practice recently are more complex than previously thought. The concern is now increasing in the face of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [1] . The spread of respiratory viral infections (RVIs) occurs primarily through contact and droplet routes. And new evidence suggests severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours [2] . Therefore, the use of masks as appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is often considered when preventing the spread of respiratory infections. Experimental data shows that the micropores of mask block dust particles or pathogens that are larger than the size of micropores. For example, the micropores of N95 masks materials are only 8 microns in diameter, which can effectively prevent the penetration of virions [3] [4] [5] .",

Only one study included in our meta-analysis investigated whether people with certain underlying conditions require masks or not [33] . Recall bias in case-control studies seems inevitable [22] . Therefore, high-quality and well-designed RCTs will be desired to investigate the actual protective effectiveness of masks. Although RCT, in general, is the best study design for assessing the effectiveness of interventions [11] , it should be noted that many cluster randomized trials are significantly different from ordinary RCTs (control, randomization and blind). In addition, cluster RCTs included in our study generally have insufficient trial design and low adherence and compliance to interventions Further interventional experiments should also pay attention to the delay between the onset of symptoms and the application of interventions, otherwise, the efficacy of non-drug interventions may be underestimated, or the statistical capacity to detect significant differences may be lacking. Research on enclosed spaces, such as transportation, is relatively rare [32]. Droplet-borne and airborne viruses are likely to cause large-scale infections among passengers sharing closed transportation [49] . In most studies, the detection criteria for virus types are not detailed and clear. Failure to analyze sufficient types of viruses may lead to biased results. For most studies conducted in healthcare settings, there is a lack of data on control subjects without masks. Because it would be unethical to randomly assign health care .

Also, our results of sub-group analysis showed an insignificant reduction of risk of H1N1 by wearing masks, which could be explained by the limitations of the included studies including relatively small sample size, and confounding factors such as prior influenza vaccinations.

HCWs are expected to work long hours with often inadequate resources and under significant pressure, facing the dangers inherent in close contact with index-patients during outbreak [37]. Through February 21, 2020, a total of 1,716 HCWs in China have become infected by SARS-CoV-2 and 5 have died [38]. In Italy, more than 2,600 healthcare workers have been infected by March 19, 2020, accounting for 8.3% of the country's total cases [39]. According to our analysis, wearing masks significantly reduced the risk of infection among HCWs by 80%. It is noteworthy that, none of the 278 HCWs wearing N95 masks in quarantined areas were infected by SARS-CoV-2 yet, 10 of the 215 HCWs who did not wear masks in the open areas were infected [35]. Therefore, wearing proper PPE including N95 masks at all clinical settings are likely to provide great benefits for HCWs during current COVID-19 pandemic.",

This difference between laboratory-confirmed cases and clinically diagnosed influenza-like illness cases were likely due to an underdiagnosis of real cases caused by too few nasal swabs collected for laboratory confirmation. Zhang et al. conducted a case-control study and found that none of the passengers always wearing masks on the international flight were infected with H1N1 [32], further suggesting that wearing masks properly may be protective when using public transport[40]. More importantly, protective benefits were also reported in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients[33]. Besides, Sokol's study also found a reduced risk of hospital-acquired RVIs by putting surgical masks on all workers and visitors in every patient room on the bone marrow transplant unit[41]. People with older age, immunosuppressed state and underlying comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, and malignancy are more prone to become severely ill when infected by SARS-CoV-2[42][43][44]. Therefore, providing appropriate safety protection measures for them, such as wearing masks, may reduce the risk of infection during current COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, those who have close contact with the elderlies, immunosuppressive patients, and people with underlying comorbidities should consider wearing masks as well.Protective effects were also found among household setting showing a 40% reduced risk of RVIs. However, one household study included in our analysis found that during the follow-up period, only 21% of face mask arm family contacts often or always wear masks, and it failed to show protective effects of wearing masks[23].
