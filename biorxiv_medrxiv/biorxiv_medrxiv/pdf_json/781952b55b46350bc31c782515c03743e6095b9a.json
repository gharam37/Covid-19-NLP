We used a publicly available mobility index based on the relative frequency of trips planned in a popular transit application to evaluate the effect of physical distancing on infection growth rates and reproductive number in 34 states and countries. We found that a 10% decrease in relative mobility in the 2 nd week of March was associated with a 11.8% relative decrease (exp(\u03b2) = 0.882; 95% CI: 0.822, 0.946) in the average daily growth rate in the fourth week of March and a change in the instantaneous reproductive number of -0.054 (95% CI: 0.097, -0.011) in the same period. Our analysis demonstrates that decreases in urban mobility were predictive of declines in epidemic growth at national or subnational scales. Mobility metrics offer an appealing method to calibrate population-level physical distancing policy and implementation.",

These physical distancing (previously termed social distancing) policies have helped control previous epidemics (1) and played a significant role in reducing COVID-19 transmission in China (2, 3) . Many regions have since adopted physical distancing measures, incrementally increasing restrictions and enforcement over time. However, public health officials have not had access to measures indicating whether current interventions are sufficient for reducing transmission. A proximal indicator of future infection rates (at a known temporal lag) is urgently needed to guide the further implementation of physical distancing measures. In this analysis, we demonstrate that a mobility index based on regular users of a web-based transit application is able to capture the effect of physical distancing on the reproductive number and growth rate of COVID-19 in 34 states and countries spanning 4 continents.",

The mobility index was provided by a public transit application (app) and uses the number of trips planned on the app to estimate the percentage of each city that is commuting relative to an internal reference from a recent usage period. The index is available from March 2 nd to present and includes all 41 cities where the app operates. Importantly, outbreaks in major urban centers (like those in our dataset) represent a large proportion of total COVID-19 cases at national and sub-national (regional) levels (4) . As a result, reduced mobility in these cities should have a significant impact on infection growth rates at larger geographies. Furthermore, changes in the city-level mobility index are related to physical distancing interventions, many of which were implemented at the national or subnational level (5); thus, reduced mobility in major urban centers should serve as a reasonable proxy for larger-scale behavior change.",

Cities within Europe, Australia, and the Americas showed strikingly similar patterns in mobility reduction that corresponded to the dates of national or sub-national physical distancing mandates, including restrictions on public gatherings or mandatory closures. Prior to the implementation of the first major physical distancing policy, the mobility index was declining by an average of 1.84% per day (95% CI: 1.53, 2.16); after implementation, the rate of decrease was 3.94% per day (slope change of 2.10%; 95% CI: 1.84, 2.36) (Fig. 1) . Increasingly restrictive physical distancing policies were adopted in an incremental fashion following the index date and thus continued declines in mobility were expected through the remainder of the month. Messaging from public health authorities and news media likely contributed to changes in behavior prior to the index date.",

To ensure results were not unduly influenced by the early onset of the Italian epidemic (with concomitant lower mobility in early March), we removed these regions and found that the relationship remained (exp(\u03b2) = 0.870; 95% CI: 0.787, 0.962). Our findings are also robust to estimation of median daily growth rate (exp(\u03b2) = 0.875; 95% CI: 0.822, 0.932). When the model is adjusted for days since the 100 th case (a measure of epidemic timing), the association is attenuated (exp(\u03b2) = 0.930; 95% CI: 0.851, 1.015). However, these two variables are highly correlated, as physical distancing measures are rarely implemented prior to significant case growth (Spearman's \u03c1 = -0.66). The mobility index in the first week of March (March 2 nd to March 8 th ) showed a similar strength of association to outcomes in the fourth week, whereas the mobility index in the third week of March (March 16 th to March 22 nd ) showed a much weaker association ( Table 1) .",

Although we have justified the use of a city-level mobility metric above, this inevitably introduces measurement error for an outcome aggregated at the national or sub-national level. Variation across countries and regions in the delay between symptom onset and public reporting of cases adds uncertainty regarding the correct lag between changes in mobility and the expected effects on growth rates. This should become less of an issue as more rapid and standardized testing is implemented across regions.",

We also did not account for imported cases in the calculation of the instantaneous reproductive number; however, locally acquired cases were certainly undercounted during this period, and likely to a greater degree than imported cases due to the increased attention on international travelers.",

Unlike a declaration of emergency, these measures have clear and consistent implications across regions.

To adjust for epidemic timing (e.g., sub-exponential growth that could occur due to the host contact network, behavioral changes and inhomogeneous mixing (11)), we ran an additional model including days since the 100 th case as a continuous covariate (excluding the Principality of Monaco, which had fewer than 50 cases by the end of week 4). However, we note that epidemic timing is strongly correlated with mean CMI in week 2. For example, Italy, which had an earlier epidemic than other European countries, had a substantially lower CMI in early March than other European countries in the dataset.",
