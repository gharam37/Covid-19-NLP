However, on the night of the 22nd, about 300 000 people left by train alone. About 70% of the people left Wuhan for other locations within the same province; 14% went to the neighboring provinces of Henan, Hunan, Anhui and Jiangxi; and the rest went further (Kinetz, 2020) . The virus kept on spreading across China, and we conducted a survey on February 20-21, 2020 on working adults from locations that vary in their travelling distance from Wuhan. We reached 410 adults, and 308 of them answered the survey, with a response rate of 75.1%.
