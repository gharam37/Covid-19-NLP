Risk factors and transmission models of COVID-19 among HCWs were analyzed and constructed. Findings A high proportion of COVID-19 HCWs had engaged in night shift-work (75.0% vs. 40.6%) and felt they were working under pressure (66.7% vs. 32.1%) than uninfected HCWs. COVID-19 HCWs had higher total scores of PSQI and NSI than uninfected HCWs. Furthermore, these scores were both positively associated with COVID-19 risk. An individual-based model (IBM) estimated the outbreak duration among HCWs in a non-typical COVID-19 ward at 62-80 days and the basic reproduction number =1.27 [1.06, 1.61].

Reports from Italy indicated that 20% of responding HCWs were infected with COVID-19. 5 In Spain, HCWs infected with COVID-19 accounts for around 12% of all confirmed cases. 6 Therefore, the establishment of protection guideline for HCWs is an important step to fight against COVID-19, and is the most important bridge that prevents the collapse of the medical system and reduces social panic. However, the specific reasons for the infection of HCWs and the failure of protection still need to be further investigated. 7 To the best of our knowledge, the risk factors in the susceptibility for COVID-19",

We aim to investigate the risk factors that play roles in the susceptibility of HCWs to COVID-19.

Governments or hospitals should try to arrange appropriate accommodations for those HCWs who had this kind of concerns. Quantifying the effect of such preventive means on susceptibility is a challenging task. However, by reducing the susceptibility of HCWs by a 1.40 factor during simulation, we observed the epidemic peak occurring on day 80 with a combined infected pool of 40 over 120 days and the highest incidence happened with 2 newly infected hosts ( Figure 3A ).",

Besides, findings in this study showed that a high proportion of COVID-19 nurses felt they were working under pressure, especially the pressure of dealing with a pneumonia of unknown etiology, such as COVID-19. We further analyzed the pressure source by NSI, and these scores were positively associated with COVID-19 risk among nurses when the contact status with infected cases was adjusted. One possible reason is the prevalent of oxidative stress among nurses with higher job stress, 14 which can damage the immune function, 15 and further lead to the increased susceptibility to COVID-19.",

Besides, we used a novel IBM to simulate the dynamics transmission of COVID-19 spread through person-to-person contact among HCWs, which accounted for the heterogeneity of disease progression, contact patterns, and transmission rates, when compared with the regular SEIR models. Our IBM simulation fitted the first 30 days' data well (12 infected HCWs among 118 HCWs from Jan 8, 2019, to Jan 23, 2020) and estimated that the epidemic peak was reached after 62-80 days with a high incidence level (4 additional HCWs on certain days).

First, there was the possibility of unmeasured residual confounding effects of contact status with infected cases, although we had adjusted for some primary confounders. Second, the insufficient sample size may influence the statistical power. Further large prospective studies are needed to validate our findings. Third, we ignored dynamic interactions between patients and HCWs in our IBM, but simply considered infectious patients as external sources. A more comprehensive model including patients, visitors, nurses, doctors, staff, and even family members should be studied in the future since the hospital is not a closed system. Fourth, our model has many uncertain parameters (susceptibility, infectivity levels, disease progress, and detailed contact patterns) that could be adjusted to available data for any given local community and can be further used to explore the efficacy of different control strategies for specific local communities and single entities (e.g., schools, working places, hospitals).",
