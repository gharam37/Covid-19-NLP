            "text": "A key challenge for estimating the epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan is the discrepancy between the officially reported number of infections and the true number of infections. A common approach to tackling the challenge is to use the number of infections exported from Wuhan to infer the true number in the city. This approach can only provide a static estimate of the epidemiological parameters before Wuhan lockdown on January 23, 2020, because there are almost no exported cases thereafter. Here, we propose a method to dynamically estimate the epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by recovering true numbers of infections from day-to-day official numbers. Using the method, we provide a comprehensive retrospection on how the disease had progressed in Wuhan from January 19 to March 5, 2020. Particularly, we estimate that the outbreak sizes by January 23 and March 5 were 11, 239 [95% CI 4,372] and 124,506 [95% CI 69,113], respectively. The effective reproduction number attained its maximum on January 24 (3.42 [95% CI 3.34-3.50]) and became less than 1 from February 7 (0.76 [95% CI 0.65-0.92]). We also estimate the effects of two major government interventions on the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan. In particular, transportation suspension and large scale hospitalization respectively prevented 33,719 and 90,072 people from getting infected in the nine-day time period right after its implementation.",

As of April 6, 2020, the virus has infected 83,005 individuals in China and 1,210,956 individuals globally according to WHO reports 2 . An essential step to contain or slow the outbreak of COVID-19 (i.e., the disease caused by the novel coronavirus) is to uncover its epidemiological parameters over time so that we can analyze the effect of different interventions on its spread 3 . Toward that end, a number of studies have attempted to estimate its epidemiological parameters such as the number of infected cases and the reproduction number 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 . A key challenge for these studies is that the officially reported number of infections (hereafter referred to as the official number) could be much lower than the true number of infections, especially in the early stage of the pandemic and at the center of the pandemic in China, the city of Wuhan 10 . This under-reporting problem could be attributed to many factors, such as insufficient amount of virus test kits and the shortage of hospital beds.",

For example, Wu et al. 5 use the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally to infer the true number of infections in Wuhan whereas Cao et al. 4 employ the official number of cases exported from Wuhan domestically. This approach can only provide a static estimate of the epidemiological parameters before January 23, 2020, because there are almost no exported cases from Wuhan after the Wuhan lockdown effective January 23, 2020 11 . However, the epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 are dynamic, partly because of various interventions over time.

            "text": "Here, we solve the under-reporting problem from a distinctive perspective. Rather than relying on cases exported from Wuhan, we propose a method to dynamically estimate the epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan over time by transforming day-do-day official numbers of infections. Specifically, we propose a Bayesian estimation method that seamlessly integrates a epidemic model characterizing the spread mechanism of the disease and a salient transformation approach, coupled with prior knowledge on key parameters of the epidemic model. Our proposed method has the following distinguishing features compared to existing methods. First, we tackle the under-reporting problem by proposing a straightforward yet effective transformation approach to adjust for potential discrepancies between official and true numbers to give better overall picture for the scope of the COVID-19 outbreak, thereby more reliably quantifying its key epidemiological parameters. Second, our approach conveniently incorporates the fast evolving knowledge from new COVID-19 literature to generate well-justified and more refined parameter estimation results with uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the temporal dynamic estimation over time keeps track of the evolving disease spread in response to interventions and holds the promise of objectively monitoring and evaluating effectiveness of various containment measures. Our analysis uncovers and demonstrates the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan from January 19, 2020 to March 5, 2020. In particular, for every day in this period, we apply the proposed method to estimate the effective reproduction number as well as true numbers of infections, such as the cumulative number of infected cases and the number of actively infected but not quarantined cases. Our proposed method also produces daily under-reporting factors, which indicate the degree of discrepancies between official and true numbers. Finally, using the dynamic epidemiological parameters estimated by our analysis, we evaluate the effects of two major interventions on the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan.",

            "text": "Using our approach detailed in the Method section, we estimated the true cumulative number of infections in Wuhan by each day for the period between January 19, 2020 and March 5, 2020. The input to our method is the cumulative number of infections in Wuhan by January 18, 2020 estimated in Imai et al. 12 , whose baseline estimate is 4,000 with a 95% confidence interval [1, 800] . Fig. 1 plots the true cumulative number of infections estimated by our method in a dotted blue line, in comparison to its respective official number reported by the government (solid blue line). As shown, the gap between these two curves is significant, especially at the beginning of the observation period measured by percentage. Such marked difference is partly attributable to the lack of testing and treatment capacities, especially at the beginning of the outbreak. In particular, we estimated that the true cumulative numbers of infections in Wuhan by January 23, 2020 (date of Wuhan lockdown) and March 5, 2020 were 11,239 [95% CI 4, 372] and 124,506 [95% CI 69,526-265,113], respectively. In comparison, their respective official numbers were 495 and 49,797. We also provide our estimated true cumulative number of infections in Wuhan by each day in the observation period (Supplementary Table 1) . Fig. 1 also presents the estimated true number of actively infected and quarantined cases by each day in the observation period (dotted red line) and its respective official number (solid red line). The former is computed by our method, which estimates the actual number of actively infected cases who are quarantined effectively, whereas the latter typically counts those actively infected and currently quarantined at hospitals. By March 5, 2020, our estimated true number of actively infected and quarantined cases was 44,778 [95% CI 24,049-112,697] whereas its official counterpart was 20,049. The gap between these two curves represents the number of actively infected people who are effectively quarantined but fail to be included in the government statistics. Many of these infected people could not be tested or officially admitted to hospital, but nevertheless conducted effective self-quarantine at home or other isolated places.",

It refers to the number of actively infected people who are not quarantined at all (e.g., non-symptomatic infected cases 13 ) or not quarantined effectively (i.e., still being able to infect others). These infected people were not recorded by government reports either. Hence, we do not have the official number of actively infected but not quarantined cases. As shown, the estimated true number of actively infected but not quarantined cases peaked on February 7, 2020 (55,139 [95% CI 24, 273] ) and then started to decline. This decline was due to the operation of a number of new hospitals and a major COVID-19 testing facility 14 . As a result, many of those actively infected but not quarantined got tested and hospitalized. Fig. 2 plots the evolution of the effective reproduction number R in Wuhan from January 19, 2020 to February 24, 2020, with the shaded area representing the 95% credible interval. As discussed in the Method section, R is estimated using a rolling-window approach with 10-day window size. Therefore, R of day t indicates the transmissibility of COVID-19 in Wuhan over the time window of [t, t + 10]. Three major government measures illustrated in the figure include Wuhan lockdown effective January 23, 2020, which stopped all innercity and inter-city public transportations, vehicle ban effective January 26, 2020, which suspended all non-essential taxi, ride-hailing operation and private vehicle services, and large scale hospitalization beginning on February 5, 2020, which tested and hospitalized a large number of infected people due to added testing and treatment capacities. As shown in the figure, R of January 19, 2020 was 3.11 [95% CI 2.93-3.40]. It then climbed up and attained its maximum on January 24, 2020, which was 3.42 [95% CI 3.34-3.50]. This initial surge could be partly attributed to increased gathering and friend visiting during the period of the Chinese Spring Festival. The effective reproduction number R declined from January 24, 2020. This could be due to the two government measures that suspended transportation in Wuhan and subsequently reduced the average contact rate among Wuhan residents. The large scale hospitalization started on February 5 further reduced R and it became less than 1 from February 7, 2020 (0.76 [95% CI 0.65-0.92]).",

This is done by introducing transformation functions with under-reporting factors, and calibrating them via a Bayesian estimation approach, which is discussed in detail in the Method section. Fig. 3 shows the dynamics of the under-reporting factor a for the period between January 19, 2020 and February 24, 2020. Note that a is the ratio of the official daily increased number of infected and quarantined cases to its respective true number. Like R, a is also estimated using a rolling-window approach and a of day t denotes the under-reporting ratio over the time window of [t, t + 10]. Fig. 3 plots a of Wuhan in a solid black line, with the shaded area representing the 95% credible interval. As shown, a of January 19, 2020 was 0.28 [95% CI 0.14-0.73], indicating that official daily increased numbers of infected and quarantined cases over the window of January 19, 2020 to January 29, 2020 were on average 28% of their respective true numbers. The under-reporting factor of Wuhan gradually increased over time. For example, the underreporting ratio over the window of January 29, 2020 to February 8, 2020 was 0.55 [95% CI 0.20-0.99] and that over the window of February 15, 2020 to February 25, 2020 was 0.94 [95% CI 0.43-0.99]. The evolution of a in Wuhan is in alignment with the reality. Due to insufficient testing and treatment capacities at the beginning of the observation period, many infected people were not tested or hospitalized hence not on government statistics. Through the addition of testing and treatment facilities, more infected people got tested and hospitalized, thereby increasing the under-reporting factor. Fig. 3 also presents the under-reporting factor of Shanghai and Beijing in a solid blue line and a solid green line, respectively. Clearly, all three cities underreported the actual number of quarantined cases at the beginning. While Shanghai and Beijing improved the reporting accuracy quickly, Wuhan did not catch up until the end of period. This result is consistent with the fact that Wuhan experienced explosive number of COVID-19 infections in contrast to the other two cities. But it did not have sufficient medical resources and hospital capacity to test and treat all the infected cases. The discrepancies between true and official numbers of infections in Fig. 3 imply that a data transformation approach, such as the one proposed in this paper, is necessary before estimating the epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan.",

These two measures constitute the intervention of transportation suspension in Wuhan, which essentially shut down the transportations in the city. It is noted that our analysis here is distinct from the study in Chinazzi et al. 7 : the former analyzes the effect of transportation suspension in Wuhan on the spread of COVID-19 in the city, while the latter studies the effect of the transportation restrictions from and to Wuhan on the spread of COVID-19 nationally and internationally.",

We then ran the SIQR model for the evaluation period, with the estimated infective number on January 26, 2020 as the initial state, and computed the cumulative numbers of infected cases without the intervention. Fig. 4 (A) plots the computed cumulative numbers of infected cases without the intervention (dotted green line). In particular, by February 4, 2020, in the absence of the intervention, the number of infections would be expected to climb up to 117,842 [95% CI 55,098-238,212]. Using this number as the benchmark, the number of infections saved by the intervention during the evaluation period was 33,719, resulting in 29% reduction from the scenario of no intervention.

The underlying challenge in studying the pandemic dynamics lies in the discrepancy between the officially reported number of infected cases in Wuhan and the actual number of infections, in together with the lack of reliable data sources after the city's complete lockdown (e.g., most existing work focuses on static estimation before the lockdown on January 23, 2020 and often relies on exported case numbers 4,5,10 ) . To address the data discrepancy issue, we employ a straightforward yet effective data transformation approach under a Bayesian dynamic epidemic modeling framework, which leads to important implications in understanding the evolution of Wuhan's outbreak. First, using prior literature knowledge on COVID-19, we adjust for the reported data to estimate and gauge the actual outbreak sizes, which is shown to be substantially larger than those from official reports particularly in early periods. Second, taking into account the adjusted numbers, the resulting trajectory for effective reproduction numbers serves as more accurate reflection of disease spread trends and the temporal changes in response to official intervention policies. Third, our study results are crucially equipped with under-reporting factors that, to some extent, reflect the difficulty level in recording the actual infective numbers and the stress of COVID-19 on medical resources. In particular, by comparison with two other major cities in China, our results from the under-reporting factors are in alignment with the reality that Wuhan as the epicenter experienced the longest periods of high stress on health care system while the numbers outside Wuhan tend to be generally trustworthy at smaller outbreak scale with better medical preparedness.",

In addition, the removed compartment in our model contains both death and cured cases, which prevents us from estimating the time-varying case fatality rates. Consequently, our assessment of large scale hospitalization does not reflect its effectiveness in death toll reduction, although literature has shown that promptly hospitalizing infected people could reduce the fatality rate for older adults and even for those with mild symptoms 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 .

This work thus gives a cautionary tale for drawing immediate public health conclusions solely based on unadjusted official case numbers that do not necessarily give a complete overall picture for pandemic situation in outbreak early periods. In addition, by examining the temporal trajectory of effective reproduction numbers, we can clearly see the gradual control effects of COVID-19 in Wuhan soon after the implementation of city-wide lockdown and suspension of all non-essential vehicle operation to reduce the contact rate among Wuhan residents; the aggressive increase of testing and hospital capacity further brought down the effective reproduction number rapidly by shortening infectious period of positive carriers and reducing new cross-infection cases from close family and community contacts. Our study affirms the believed importance and effectiveness of imposing tight non-essential travel restrictions (which may also include, e.g., the shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders) early on, as well as swiftly addressing the testing shortage issues and avoiding hospital overcrowding for effective mitigation of COVID-19 community spread.",

It is worth noting that daily number of newly infected cases dramatically increased to 13,436 on February 12, 2020 from 1,104 the day before, according to CCDC. This surge was attributed to the change of government criteria for confirming infections. Before February 12, 2020, only those tested positive by test kits were considered as infected. Starting from February 12, 2020, an infection was confirmed either based on positive testing result or through clinical diagnosis using computed tomography (CT) scans. As a result, suspected infections by CT scans before February 12, 2020 were relabeled as confirmed infections on February 12, 2020. It is therefore necessary to adjust the number of newly infected cases on February 12, 2020 (i.e., 13,436) by reallocating this number to days prior to and including February 12, 2020, proportional to the number of daily suspected cases in these days.",

These state variables and system parameters are summarized in Table 1 ; their meanings and the epidemic model will be elaborated in the next subsection. In particular, Q t represents the number of actively infected and quarantined cases by day t and R t represents the cumulative number of removed cases by day t. Ideally, we can obtain data about actual diffusion of COVID-19 over time. That is, ideally, we can have stochastically realized true values of Q t and R t for t = 1, 2, 3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , denoted as Q e t and R e t . In general, if the realized true values of all state variables were known, we could estimate system parameters \u0398 H using well-developed statistical methods (e.g., 25, 26, 27 from frequentist perspectives). In reality, we only observe a subset of state variables with their officially reported numbers Q o t and R o t . Due to the under-reporting problem, these official numbers, Q o t and R o t , could be much lower than Q e t and R e t , respectively. As a result, directly applying an existing method to Q o t and R o t may not generate or reliably uncover the epidemiological parameters of COVID-19. To address this issue, we propose transformation functions that aim to recover Q e t and R e t from observed Q o t and R o t with some (unknown) transformation parameters \u0398 f .",

Second, the posterior distribution, given our proposed modeling strategy and prior, has clear interpretation and can provide straightforward uncertainty quantification. To our knowledge, the MLE approach for our specified model settings has no well-developed inference theory for the estimators.

Therefore the infectious period of COVID-19 ranges from 3 to 10.5 days. Accordingly, we set parameter \u00b5 to be uniformly distributed over ( 1 10.5 , 1 3 ). In addition, to the best of our knowledge, there is no literature on the duration from quarantine to removal for COVID-19 infected cases. Therefore, we collect data about 32 death cases and 22 cured cases in Wuhan from local newspapers. Details of these cases are given in Supplementary Table 2 . Among the death cases, the minimum duration of hospitalization is 1 day and the maximum is 40 days. The range of hospitalization for cured cases is from 6 to 30 days.

Subsequently, the computed (S 2 , I 2 , Q 2 , R 2 ) can serve as the initial values for the second time window [2, 3, ..., T +2], and we continue this strategy as the rolling window moves forward. Consequently, the proposed dynamic parameter estimation procedure is expected to track the trend of the epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 and dynamically assesses temporally evolving situations. 51 the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",
