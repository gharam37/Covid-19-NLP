For China and South Korea, who have already flattened their infection curves, the number of infected individuals (I(t)) exhibits power-law behavior before flattening of the curve. Italy has transitioned to the power-law regime for some time. For the other six nations-USA, Spain, Germany, France, Japan, and India-a power-law regime is beginning to appear after exponential growth. We argue that the transition from an exponential regime to a powerlaw regime may act as an indicator for flattening of the epidemic curve. We also argue that long-term community transmission and/or the transmission by asymptomatic carriers traveling long distances may be inducing the power-law growth of the epidemic.",

[10] constructed a India-specific model for devising intervention strategies; they focussed on four metros-Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Bengaluru-along with intercity connectivity. To account for spatio-temporal behavour, Min et al. [11] simulated how a disease could spread within a network with different mixing styles, and showed that the average epidemic size and speed depend critically on network parameters. In addition, there are many epidemic models that are inspired by population growth models [5, 12] . There are several other models designed to understand the spread of COVID-19 [13] [14] [15] .",

Note however that the power law regimes are quite small, except for Italy. We believe that the curves will flatten further down from here, that is, they will transition to subsequent power laws with lower exponents. However, we need more data of subsequent days for a definitive conclusion. Figure 1 also contains plots for\u0130, derivatives of I(t), that represents daily new count of infections. Similar to I(t),\u0130 increases exponentially in the beginning. After this, we observe a transition to power law regimes. For the power law I(t) \u223c Bt n , we derive that\u0130 \u223c I 1\u22121/n . Clearly, this slope is suppressed compared to the exponential regime by a factor of I \u22121/n . From time t 0 , I(t) doubles at t = 2 1/n t 0 . For South Korea, n = 3, hence for t 0 = 10, the count doubles at t = 10 \u00d7 2 1/3 \u2248 12.6 day, or in the interval of 2.6 days. This is a slower doubling rate than that in the exponential phase, which was one day. Note however that the epidemic growth in the power law regime is still very significant because I(t) is large. For large n (e.g., 4 or 5),\u0130 \u221d I, which is same as the formula for the exponential growth (refer to the t 4 regime of Italy and Japan). Also note that in the linear regime,\u0130 is constant, implying a constant number of new cases every day.",

In early stages, the epidemic spreads via contacts between infected and susceptible individuals. However, once the epidemic has spread widely, then indirect transmissionscontacts with infected surfaces, public transport, airbegin to play an important role in the epidemic growth. Such transmissions are referred to as community spread or transmission. This is analogous to interactions among clusters of molecules in phase transition, and those among large fluid vortices in turbulence. Such interactions are responsible for the dynamic scaling in phase transition, and for the aforementioned turbulence diffusion [23, 24, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Super spreading of COVID-19 and the powerlaw regime of I(t) may be connected to the above phenomena. Note however that community spread could also contribute in the exponential growth phase; the two exponential regimes in Fig. 1 may be due to these reasons. These issues need further exploration.",

These constants depend on various factors, such as immunity levels of the population, climate conditions, extent of lockdowns and social distancing, etc. South Korea and China exhibit power law growths of t 3 and t 2 respectively, from which we may infer that a stricter lockdown may result in a relatively lower power-law exponent. The second exponential regime for USA, France, Germany, and Spain, as well as stretched power law regimes for Italy may be due to delay in the lockdowns. For India, for around a week, the exponent appears to be unity, but it may be too early to deduce anything from it. We also believe that a careful study of the I(t) curves may help in forecasting when the epidemic curve will flatten. Now we summarize our findings. The COVID-19 real-time data of infected individuals, I(t), contains useful information that may help forecast the development of the epidemic. We conjecture that the power law growth of I(t) may be due to the epidemic transmission by asymptomatic carriers traveling long distances, and/or due to community spread.",
