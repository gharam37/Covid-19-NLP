As the pandemic 13 progresses, information about the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among humans is critical 14 to apply appropriate infection control measures and to slow its spread. Here we show that SARS-15 CoV-2 is transmitted efficiently via direct contact and via the air (via respiratory droplets and/or 16 aerosols) between ferrets. Intranasal inoculation of donor ferrets resulted in a productive upper 17 respiratory tract infection and long-term shedding, up to 11 to 19 days post-inoculation. SARS-18 CoV-2 transmitted to four out of four direct contact ferrets between 1 and 3 days after exposure 19 and via the air to three out of four independent indirect recipient ferrets between 3 and 7 days 20 after exposure. The pattern of virus shedding in the direct contact and indirect recipient ferrets 21 was similar to that of the inoculated ferrets and infectious virus was isolated from all positive 22",

Here, we used a 52 ferret transmission model to assess whether SARS-CoV-2 spreads through direct contact and/or 53 through the air (via respiratory droplets and/or aerosols). For this purpose, individually housed donor ferrets were inoculated intranasally with a strain of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from a German 55 traveller returning from China. Six hours post-inoculation (hpi), a direct contact ferret was added to 56 each of the cages. The next day, indirect recipient ferrets were placed in adjacent cages, separated 57 from the donor cages by two steel grids, 10 cm apart, allowing viruses to be transmitted only via the 58 air (Supplementary Figure 1) . On alternating days to prevent cross-contamination, throat, nasal and 59 rectal swabs were collected from each ferret in the inoculated and direct contact groups and from 60 the indirect recipient group, followed by SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR and virus titration.
