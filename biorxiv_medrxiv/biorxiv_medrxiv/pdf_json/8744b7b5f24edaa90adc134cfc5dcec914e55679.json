            "text": "The infection of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 have caused more than 150,000 deaths, but no vaccine or specific therapeutic antibody is currently available. SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike protein, in particular the receptor binding domain (RBD), to bind human cell receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry, and thus targeting RBD holds the promise for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, a competitive biopanning strategy of a phage display antibody library was applied to screen blocking antibodies against RBD. High-affinity antibodies were enriched after the first round using a standard panning process in which RBD-His recombinant protein was immobilized as a bait. At the next two rounds, immobilized ACE2-Fc and free RBD-His proteins were mixed with the enriched phage antibodies. Antibodies binding to RBD at epitopes different from ACE2-binding site were captured by the immobilized ACE2-Fc, forming a \"sandwich\" complex. Only antibodies competed with ACE2 for recognizing RBD at the same or similar epitopes can bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by the Ni-NTA magnetic beads. Top 1 lead from the competitive biopanning of a synthetic antibody library, Lib AB1, was produced as the full-length IgG1 format. It was proved to competitively block the binding of RBD to ACE2 protein, and potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of ACE2-overexpressing Hela cells with IC50 values of 12nM. Nevertheless, top 1 lead from the standard biopanning of Lib AB1, can only bind to RBD in vitro but not have the blocking or neutralization activity. Our strategy can efficiently isolate the blocking antibodies of RBD, and it would speed up the discovery of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. author/funder. All rights reserved.

Its pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, is a newly identified \u03b2-coronavirus. Coronavirus got the family name from the spike(S) protein on the viral particle. The highly glycosylated S protein stays compact in trimeric state, recognizes receptor on the host cell membrane, and then undergoes a series of conformation changes, proteolysis events and membrane fusion to complete viral entry. For vaccines, clinical diagnosis, early prevention and medication, the S protein is the most significant target.",

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 recognized the same host cell receptor ACE2 for mediating viral entry into host cells. It was reported that SARS-CoV S protein trimer bound to ACE2 at 1:1 in ratio [1, 2] . Before infection, RBD of each SARS-CoV S monomer was partially buried in the inactive \"down\" conformation and not able to bind ACE2 due to steric clash. Once infection started, one monomer turned \"up\" its RBD to expose enough space to ACE2, inducing further conformational open and loose for proteolysis [1, 3] . Atomic-level structural analysis suggested that the spatial interaction and interface between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 was mostly in accordance with the SARS-CoV case [4] . Besides, a Cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein trimer published recently showed that one of the three RBDs was in \"up\" conformation and naturally exposed the whole interaction interface [5] , while the classic closed symmetric trimer still existed [6] . That might explain why SARS-CoV-2 is much more contagious than SARS-CoV and causing tricky problems worldwide.",

Briefly, 100\u03bcl of ACE2-hFc protein (5\u03bcg/ml) was coated on the 96-well Maxisorp plates. The wells were washed and blocked with 1% PVA, and then the mixture of antibody library (10 10 pfu per well) and free RBD-His protein (100ng per well) was added. After a 2-hour competitive binding, the supernatant was transferred into a 1.5ml microfuge tube containing the pre-washed Ni-NTA magnetic beads (GenScript) and incubated on a shaker at room temperature for 1 hour. Beads were collected using the magnetic separation rack and washed by the PT buffer for 8 times. Bound phages were eluted with 100mM HCl (100\u03bcl per tube) after 5-min incubation. Beads were collected using the magnetic separation rack, and the supernatant was transfer into a tube for neutralization. Half the neutralized phage solution was mixed with 1ml of actively growing NEB alpha F' cells and amplified as the standard biopanning protocol. 10\u03bcl of the bacterial culture before infection with helper phages was taken, diluted, and grown on the LB plates containing 50\u03bcg/ml carbenicillin at 37\u00b0C overnight. The single clones were picked up next day for the phage ELISA assay. Fig.1 Schematic presentation of a competitive biopanning strategy. A specific binder of target protein was added during the binding step for the selection of blocking antibodies. In this work, the immobilized ACE2-hFc captured RBD-His and the antibodies binding RBD at different epitopes, forming a complex like a \"sandwich\". However, when an antibody recognized the same or similar epitopes within RBD as the ACE2 did, it could block RBD-ACE2 interaction. The antibodies would bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by the Ni-NTA magnetic beads.",

            "text": "RBD-ACE2 interaction initiated viral infection of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Their RBDs share high sequence identities (73%) and structure homology, so the well-established SARS-CoV antibodies were firstly assumed short-cut therapeutic candidates for SARS-CoV-2. However, the real scenario is much more problematic. Several independent peer-reviewed studies as well as preprinted ones have proved that all structurally known SARS-CoV specific antibodies, including S230, 80R, m396 and F26G19, have no cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 [4, 5, 9] . These antibodies all compete with ACE2 to bind SARS-CoV RBD, but their epitopes only have limited overlaps of the full ACE2-RBD interface, which could be the reason of lacking cross-reactivity. CR3022 is a special case with 86% conserved key residues in the epitope between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Its cross-reactivity was remarkable, but one site loss of N-glycan results in 1~2 magnitude reduction of binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD [9] . As in human life, RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies derived from COVID-19 recovered individuals indicated similar patterns of no cross-reactivities with either SAR-CoV or MERS-CoV [10] . In general, structural and functional analysis suggests that targeting SARS-CoV-2 RBD could be a direct and promising therapeutic strategy, while focusing on previous SARS-CoV antibodies is not very ideal or efficient. No SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific monoclonal antibody has been reported from human antibody libraries (up to April 17 th , 2020). In the meantime, SARS-CoV-2 spreads unexpectedly fast around the world, and a new study just shifted its basic reproductive number (R0) from 2.2 to 5.7 [11] . A rapid and effective method of obtaining the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies is much required. Na\u00ef ve antibody libraries derived from natural immune systems have their capacity limits, while synthetic libraries with higher diversity have more opportunities to isolate binders especially for novel infectious antigens. Compared to a na\u00ef ve antibody library of 10 8~1 0 9 diversity, a synthetic library with additional artificial randomization on CDRs can reach diversity as high as 10 12~1 0 13 . When the recombinant RBD and ACE2 proteins were ready, it took 3 weeks to isolate, produce and verify the antibodies in this study. Using the standard biopanning method, we enriched RBDspecific phages from our synthetic Lib AB1 but not from our na\u00ef ve antibody libraries (data not shown). Unfortunately, the top1 lead rRBD-16 from the standard biopanning of Lib AB1 couldn't block the RBD-ACE2 interaction (Fig. 4) , although it did bind to RBD with an EC50 of 5.3nM (Fig.  3) . The clinical potential and applications of an antibody often depends on its binding epitopes of the target protein. A high-affinity antibody against the target protein can be screened from a phage display antibody library using the standard biopanning process, but its binding epitopes are identified by some extra steps, such as epitope mapping and competitive ELISA. We therefore developed a new competitive biopanning strategy to efficiently isolate isotype-specific antibodies from libraries. As expected, the top1 lead rRBD-15 successfully bind to RBD in compete with ACE2 both in solution and in pseudovirus, and its binding affinity is quite high in 1~10nM differing from measuring methods. In conclusion, our strategic discovery of human monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 RBD may fill the blanks of antibody-related pharmaceutical development and shed author/funder.
