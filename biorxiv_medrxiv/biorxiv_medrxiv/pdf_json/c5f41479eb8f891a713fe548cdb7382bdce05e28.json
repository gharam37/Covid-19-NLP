            "text": "The infectious novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 outbreak has been declared as a public health emergency of international concern, and later as an epidemic. To date, this outbreak has infected more than one million people and killed over fifty thousand people across the world. In most countries, the COVID-19 incidence curve rises sharply in a short span of time, suggesting a transition from a disease free (or low-burden disease) equilibrium state to a sustained infected (or high-burden disease) state. Such a transition from one stable state to another state in a relatively short span of time is often termed as a critical transition. Critical transitions can be, in general, successfully forecasted using many statistical measures such as return rate, variance and lag-1 autocorrelation. Here, we report an empirical test of this forecasting on the COVID-19 data sets for nine countries including India, China and the United States. For most of the data sets, an increase in autocorrelation and a decrease in return rate predict the onset of a critical transition. Our analysis suggests two key features in predicting the COVID-19 incidence curve for a specific country: a) the timing of strict social distancing and/or lockdown interventions implemented, and b) the fraction of a nation's population being affected by COVID-19 at the time of implementation of these interventions. Further, using satellite data of nitrogen dioxide which is emitted predominantly as a result of anthropogenic activities, as an indicator of lockdown policy, we find that in countries where the lockdown was implemented early and strictly have been successful in reducing the extent of transmission of the virus. These results hold important implications for designing effective strategies to control the spread of infectious pandemics.",

Thus, concerned with the public health and well-being affected due to COVID-19, various countries have adopted comprehensive strategies converging to social distancing such as the closure of schools, ban of large gatherings, isolation of symptomatic individuals, and monitoring travelers, particularly to those from COVID-19 hotspots. Large scale lockdowns of populations have been implemented to prevent social contacts and reduce reproduction of the infected cases [5] [6] [7] . Evidence also highlights the impor-often irreversible transition to an alternative stable state [11, 20] . In particular, the phenomenon of CSD can be captured as a large time taken by a system to return to its previous states due to which the rate of return of a system decreases prior to a transition. Moreover, it leads to an increase in the short term memory of a system, this feature can be identified by the changes in the correlation structure of a time-series preceding a critical transition [13, 14, [21] [22] [23] . Thus, it is crucial to understand whether these indicators capture the characteristics of slowing down in the epidemic growth curves.",

The total reported cases (confirmed) at the time of the lockdown were nearly 623 (accounting for approximately 4.4732\u00d710 \u22127 of the total population). The daily increase in the number of confirmed cases in China, thus, saturated nearly in mid of March, hence flattening the growth curve of the total confirmed cases. European countries adopted different non-pharmaceutical measures to intervene in the disease transmission. The spread began later in Italy as compared to China; however, the strict interventions were initiated on 9 March, which marks a gap of nearly 40 days from the first reported case. Spain, which is continued to suffer severely by the virus, reported its first infected case on 1st Feb and took nearly 45 days to put the country on lockdown(see Table I ). India confirmed its first case on 30 January and prompted \"Janata curfew\" and lockdown measures for complete cessation of public contacts nearly around 22 March, with approximately 2.36 \u00d7 10 \u22127 of its population as COVID-19 infected cases, while this proportion was more than 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22124 % in the US. Therefore, it is essential to unfold how prolonged gaps between the arrival of the epidemic and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as quarantining/social distancing can influence public health and the environment at a national as well as a global scale. More interesting is to understand if the statistical tools can be useful to formulate laws to stifle the spread of an epidemic.",

We use statistical tools to calculate the return rate and lag-1 autocorrelation function of the time-series data of the cumulative confirmed cases each in nine different countries. We investigate the EWSs for the alarming situations observed in the growth curves in each of the countries and record the timing of implementation of containment strategies to slow down the outbreak. Our work suggests that the dynamics of growth curve in the initial 40 days since the first reported case can signal an upcoming sudden rise in the cumulative number of infected cases. Thus, preliminary actions of at least 20 days before the timing of observed EWSs is crucial for an effective and timely containment of the disease. Delay in the strict surveillance and control measures can increase the time to contain the spread, which in turn will affect a larger proportion of the population. Furthermore, the proportion of the affected cases on the commencement of public health measures plays a significant role in containing the epidemic in each country. The timeline of implementation of strict intervention strategies coincided with that of emergence of EWSs for many countries such as India, Italy and Germany. However, the relatively low proportion of the affected cases in the case of India compared to Italy or Germany can be a significant factor explaining the slow rise for India but a relatively disruptive situation in the other countries. Thus, a combination of these two factors for India may restrict the extent of COVID-19 spread in the country, as compared to many other countries across the world. We conclude that model-independent forecasting systems can be applied to clinical data sets for predictability of the disease re-occurrence and formulate control policies.",

Figure 1 depicts the growth curve of the fraction of the affected population in each of these countries. Interestingly, it is noted that the growth curve of the confirmed cases follows a slow increment for around initial 20-25 days, which can be interpreted as a time window to control the epidemic promptly and effectively. Since human to human contact is a leading transmitter of the disease, therefore, by-passing a certain threshold of infected cases, the growth curve shows an increasing slope and finally depicts a sudden large shift/transition in the fraction of affected populations (Fig. 1 ) [25] . It is important to note that the growth in number of cases for China and South Korea, the countries which initiated public monitoring/social distancing actions relatively earlier as compared to the other countries, saturates after nearly 3-4 weeks from the initiation of the lockdown.

To examine whether the system slows down to recover from perturbation while approaching the transition, we estimate the changes in the return rate and autocorrelation at first lag (ACF(1)) of each extracted data for all the nine countries (see Methods). Critical slowing down is reflected in systems near a critical transition through an increase in the autocorrelation. We observe that after nearly 40 days of the onset of the epidemic, the short term memory of the time-series data exhibits an increasing trend in most of the countries (Fig. 2) . However, there are no significant signals of CSD exhibited by ACF(1) for the datasets of India as well as Italy (Figs. 2J and 2P). The return rates for all, except India ( Fig. 2A) , decreases, thus signaling to ex-pect a sudden rise in the number of the COVID-19 cases for these countries. Furthermore, the strength of signals varies amongst countries depending upon the data sets determining the fraction of affected populations in individual countries. For instance, the trends in the UK are observed to be very strong, with ACF(1) approaching close to 1 (see Fig. 2Q ) [21] . Since the time lag of up to almost two weeks is expected for the detection of symptomatic cases, the observed signals of CSD around 40 days indicate that the total cases gathered till then must be infected with the disease around two weeks ago. Thus, suitable preventive and surveillance strategies adopted in the initial 20-25 days are capable of suppressing the COVID-19 outbreak [26] .",

The rising indicators of CSD around 40 days also suggest that the time gap in implementing the protocols such as the closure of public gatherings, controlled public movement, lockdown beyond 15-25 days from the onset of the crisis can significantly influence the growth curve and result in the more extended time required to flatten it. However, the interventions during the initial 40 days in each of these countries can slowly hamper the daily increase in the number of cases. In the US, the hints of an approaching transition are visible relatively early (around 35 days after the first case was reported) by both the return rate as well as the ACF(1) (Figs. 2D and 2M).",

So far, Germany and Italy, which had the largest outbreak in Europe around mid of the March, had visible signals of the forthcoming transition (Figs. 2F and 2O). It is noted that each of the countries, namely India, Germany, and Italy, adopted concerned public health measures around the time when the EWSs were visible in their respective data sets (see the arrow-heads on the x-axis in Fig. 1 ). However, the fraction of the population affected by the time in Germany and Italy was much higher (approximately 2.9 \u00d7 10 \u22124 and 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , respectively) as compared to that for India \u2212 2.36\u00d710 \u22127 . Thus, the growth curve projected a significant rise in these two countries, whereas the rise in the number of cases in India is still gradual and is expected to follow a similar response owing to the effectiveness of these interventions. Overall, our analyses suggest that delayed interventions (depending upon the signals of CSD) along with the fraction of the affected population can influence the country-wise variation in the daily number of rising cases.

Figure 4 depicts the distribution of the test statistic of the surrogate time-series. Solid lines show the trend estimate obtained for the original timeseries.

While in the case of the US, the probability of randomness in our observed estimates is relatively high (Figs. 4C and 4K), rapid spreading in the epidemic makes it keystone to consider applicability of EWSs to warn-off such events.

The solid curve in each subfigure of Fig. 6 represents a 10-triad moving window average. In the majority of the countries, the timing of NO 2 decline concurs with the spread of the virus and the onset of pragmatic lockdown in a country may be hypothesized by the reversal (or break) in the trend of NO 2 . In China (Fig 6B) , the decreasing trend in NO 2 is evident from January end till February; after that, it starts increasing which is coincident with the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 disease. In India (Fig 6A) , South Korea (Fig 6C) , US (Fig 6D) , Italy ( Fig 6G) and Spain (Fig 6F) , the decreasing trend in NO 2 coincides with time of the rapid spread in the virus (Fig. 1) . We estimate that after the date of official enforcement of lockdown, time-averaged NO 2 decreased by 35.9% in China and 50.4% in Italy compared to the pre-lockdown period. India has also seen a significant drop by 5% of NO 2 in the last 2 triads around the day of \"Janata curfew\". The decreased pattern in NO 2 is expected to continue as the lockdown prevails up to 14 April. It should be noted that we did not control for meteorological variations which may have a significant impact on total-column NO 2 over the period of our study [27] .

We use the data of the number of COVID-19 cases in nine different countries to investigate some statistical patterns in the growth curves. The number of cases covers a small fraction of the population during the initiation of the epidemic, and the fraction remains nearly stagnant for around 20 days from the arrival of the first case. After the threshold of around 20 days, the number of cases starts increasing rapidly, and in a relatively shorter span a significant fraction of the population can be affected. This trend is analogous to the idea that the growth curve remains close to one stable state for sufficient time and, crossing a time threshold invokes a sudden shift/transition to another stable state, where a significant fraction of the population gets affected. In our work, we employ statistical indicators of critical slowing down to check if such transitions can be signaled beforehand and how the anticipation of such transitions can help mitigate such crisis at a policy level.",

In the vicinity of 35-40 days, an increase in the short term memory (at lag 1) of the data as well as a decrease in the return rate indicates the phenomenon of critical slowing down. Our work suggests that while non-pharmaceutical interventions are necessary to mitigate such epidemic, the timing of initiation of concerned actions can strongly influence the outcome of the situation. Owing to the time lag in the detection of symptomatic cases, the statistical indicators suggest that the initial 20-25 days being crucial to suppress the loss of public health. The controlled response of the epidemic growth curve for China and South Korea can be associated with the time distance between implementation of interventions and the transition point. Thus, EWSs analyses is crucial while defining the onset of the interventions and suppress the rise of daily cases. Importantly, another crucial aspect is the proportion of affected cases in each country, i.e., a measure of the fraction of the country's population, and not the absolute numbers, which is infected at the time of interventions such as a strict lockdown. As probability of the propagation of disease can be thought of as mostly similar or equal amongst individuals across the globe, it depends upon the fraction of infected cases in each country during the beginning of interventions. For instance, a decrease in the return rate and increased autocorrelation anticipated the upcoming rise in the growth curves for both India as well as Italy, and interestingly, both the countries imposed individual nationwide lockdown near the situation close to the transition (Table I) . However, the control in India depicts better results in altering the growth curve than that in Italy. The alterations in the growth curve is most likely to be a consequence of a difference in the proportion of cases affected by the epidemic at the beginning of mitigation strategies. India resembling China in terms of the total population density accounted for approximately 2.36 \u00d7 10 \u22127 cases of the total population, while Italy with relatively less population density crossed 1.22 \u00d7 10 \u22124 cases of their total population. Thus, even with imposition of the public health measures near the signals of CSD, the outcome for both the countries can dramatically vary. Furthermore, the disruptive situation in the US is indicated by EWSs, as the EWSs indicators were visible quite early for the US. Thus, sharp rise in the number of cases for the country is a consequence of both the delay in effective social distancing interventions .

Population weighted average column NO 2 was found to decrease with amplification in a number of cases across most of the countries. Apart from this, NO 2 column quantities may be used as a proxy to estimate the effectiveness of a lockdown on air quality. We find that NO 2 column quantities started following a decreasing trend during the last week of February in Italy and US which indicate a partial unofficial closure of anthropogenic activities, taking into consideration that the official COVID-19 induced lockdown was enforced on 09 March and around 25 March in Italy and the US, respectively. Whereas, in the UK, an increasing trend in NO 2 column till the last week of March indicates no such public awareness to restrict anthropogenic activities (the government declared the lockdown from 23 March).

We generate 1000 surrogate time-series of the same length as the analysed real data sets to test the likelihood of obtaining the computed trends by chance. The surrogate records are obtained on bootstrapping the real datasets by shuffling the original residual time-series and sampling the data with replacement. This method generates the surrogate time-series with a similar distribution of the original time-series [18] . For each surrogate, we consider the Kendall-\u03c4 estimate as the test statistic to measure the robustness of the outcomes. Further, we calculate the fraction of the surrogates having the same or higher (lower, for return rates) test static value than the original data and measure the probability P (\u03c4 * \u2264 \u03c4 ) to calculate that the observed test statistic is by chance.",

Thus, it is essential to check the efficacy of our results to such choices. In particular, we analyse the sensitivity of our observations to the choice of rolling window size and degree of smoothing (filtering bandwidth) used during the calculation of indicators and detrending/filtering the data sets, respectively. We estimate the return rate using window sizes ranging from 40% to 90% of the time-series length in an increment of 2 points and for bandwidths ranging from 5% to 100% with the increment of 2 points. We quantify the robustness of the outcomes towards the range of window sizes and bandwidth using the distribu-tion of the Kendall-\u03c4 test statistic.",

Worldwide, the lockdown response to the onset and spread of COVID-19 caused a decrease in daily and economic activities, which in turn is expected to cause a reduction in ambient air pollution. This can also be used as an indicator to determine whether government policies of lockdowns/restricted human movements are successful or not. To further examine this, we use the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) retrieved total column NO 2 (available from https://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/omi.html) as a proxy to infer the change in anthropogenic air pollution for the timeperiod of our study. OMI flies onboard the EOS Aura sun-synchronous polar-orbiting satellite. It has a swath length of 2600km and a level-2, spatial resolution of 13\u00d724km 2 [34] . The OMI NO 2 column was satisfactorily validated against surface spectrometer measurements in recent studies [35, 36] . To roughly obtain a global coverage, we consider 3-day time slices (triads) within which the overlapping swath overpasses were averaged. Thereafter, we perform a population-weighted average of the grids that lie within the political boundaries of the countries considered in this study. Gridded population data was obtained for 2015 from SEDAC (https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4). .
