            "text": "Human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 are respiratory pathogen of zoonotic origin that have gained 23 worldwide distribution. OC43 apparently emerged from a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) spill-over. All 24 three viruses attach to 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans via spike protein S with hemagglutinin-esterase HE 25 acting as a receptor-destroying enzyme. In BCoV, an HE lectin domain promotes esterase activity 26 towards clustered substrates. OC43 and HKU1, however, lost HE lectin function as an adaptation to 27 humans. Replaying OC43 evolution, we knocked-out BCoV HE lectin function and performed forced 28 evolution-population d ynamics analysis. Loss of HE receptor-binding selected for second-site 29 mutations in S, decreasing S binding affinity by orders of magnitude. Irreversible HE mutations 30 selected for cooperativity in virus swarms with low-affinity S minority variants sustaining propagation 31 of high-affinity majority phenotypes. Salvageable HE mutations induced successive second-site 32 substitutions in both S and HE. Apparently, S and HE are functionally interdependent and co-evolve to 33 optimize the balance between attachment and release. This mechanism of glycan-based receptor 34 usage, entailing a concerted, fine-tuned activity of two envelope protein species, is unique among 35 CoVs, but reminiscent of that of influenza A viruses (IAVs). Apparently, general principles fundamental 36 to virion-sialoglycan interactions prompted convergent evolution of two important groups of human 37 and animal pathogens. The subfamily Orthocoronavirinae comprises a group of enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses of 40 clinical and veterinary significance. Adding to the socio-economic impact of coronaviruses (CoVs) 41 already extant in humans and livestock, the emergence of 'new' CoVs through cross species 42 transmission poses an ever-looming threat to public health, animal health, and food production. 43 Seven coronaviruses are known to infect humans, but not all of them have become established. The 44 introduction of SARS CoV in 2002 from horseshoe bats with masked palm civets as incidental transient 45 hosts, was rapidly contained through quarantine measures 1 . MERS CoV, natural to dromedary camels, 46 causes a classical zoonotic infection with limited human-to-human spread 2 . December 2019, a 47 member of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), called 48 SARS-CoV-2 and 79.5% identical to the 2002 SARS CoV variant, emerged in Wuhan, China 3,4 to progress 49",

            "text": "Four other respiratory coronaviruses of zoonotic origin already did succeed in becoming true human 52 viruses with world-wide distribution 5-7 . Among them are HKU1 and OC43 (subgenus Embecovirus, 53 genus Betacoronavirus), related yet distinct viruses that arose from different zoonotic progenitors and 54 entered the human population independently. OC43 is far more related to bovine coronavirus (BCoV), 55 its presumptive ancestor, with early isolates sharing 97% genome identity 8,9 . Together with viruses of 56 swine, canines, equines and lagomorphs, OC43 and BCoV are considered host range variants of the 57 virus species Betacoronavirus-1 (collectively referred to as \u03b21CoVs throughout) 7 . OC43 apparently 58 emerged 70 to 130 years ago from a single cross species transmission event that gave rise to a human-59 only virus [8][9][10] . Like OC43, other \u03b21CoVs also exhibit host specificity 8,11 . While these observations attest 60 to the host promiscuity and zoonotic potential of embecoviruses and \u03b21CoVs in particular, they are 61 also indicative for the existence of host barriers, the breaching of which selects for adaptive mutations 62 that result in host specialization and, ultimately, virus speciation.

Homotrimeric 'peplomers' comprised of spike protein S and extending 20 nm 67 from the viral membrane, mediate virion attachment to entry receptors and membrane fusion 12 . 68 Interspersed are stubby 8-nm homodimeric projections comprised of the hemagglutinin-esterase 69 (HE) 13-15 , a dual function protein typically encompassing a receptor-binding lectin domain specific for 70 O-acetylated sialic acid (O-Ac-Sia) and a receptor destroying sialate-O-acetylesterase domain 16-20 . The 71 HE lectin domain contributes to virion attachment, but at the same time enhances sialate-O-72 acetylesterase activity towards clustered sialoglycotopes 11 . 73 Some embecoviruses, like mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and related CoVs in rodents, attach to 4-or 9-74 O-acetylated sialosides (4-or 9-O-Ac-Sias) via HE 21-25 and to a proteinaceous entry receptor via S 26,27 . 75 Others, animal \u03b21CoVs included, bind to 9-O-Ac-Sias via HE 28 but, remarkably, also via S 29,30 or, in the 76 case of human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1, even exclusively via S 11,31,32 . 77 Structure function analyses of HE and S proteins have yielded a wealth of data on ligand binding, 78 substrate selection and protein-glycan interactions. The receptor binding sites (RBSs) of CoV HE lectin 79 domains and those in related proteins of toro-and influenza C/D viruses 22,33-35 differ in sequence and 80 structure yet conform to a common architectural design with a deep hydrophobic pocket ('P1') to 81 accommodate the crucial sialate-O-acetyl moiety, and an adjacent pocket or depression ('P2') to 82 accept the 5-N-acyl group 17,21,22,33 . Characteristically, P1 and P2 are separated by an aromatic side 83 chain and binding of the ligand is stabilized further through electrostatic protein-glycan interactions 84 typically involving distinctive Sia functions such as the Sia glycerol side chain, the 5-N-Acyl and/or the 85 Sia carboxylate. The RBS for 9-O-Ac-Sia in the S proteins of BCoV and OC43, identified by comparative 86 structural analysis 32 and confirmed by the cryo-EM holostructure of OC43 S 36 , conforms to this 87 blueprint. Moreover, this site is structurally and functionally conserved in HKU1 32 . : bioRxiv preprint 5 Much less is known about the functional relationship between S and HE, and the role of HE in particular 89 remains poorly understood. In MHV, HE expression is dispensable for replication and rapidly lost 90 during cell culture propagation 15 . Conversely, in \u03b21CoVs, HE seems critical for infection. In OC43, loss 91 of HE-associated acetyl esterase activity abrogates the production of infectious virus and virus 92 dissemination in cell culture 37 . Moreover, acetyl-esterase inhibitors impede BCoV replication 19 , and 93 antibodies against HE neutralize the virus in vitro and in vivo 38-40 . Still, even among \u03b21CoVs there are 94 differences in HE function apparently correlating with host specificity. Whereas HE lectin activity is 95 strictly maintained in BCoV 28 , OC43 lost this function through progressive accumulation of mutations 96 in the HE RBS, apparently as an adaptation to replication in the human respiratory tract 11 . 97 Nevertheless, isolates of either virus propagate in cultured cells. To better understand the 98 consequences of loss of HE lectin function as it occurred during OC43 and also HKU1 evolution, we 99 took a reverse genetics/forced evolution approach with BCoV as a model. The findings reveal that HE 100 and S are functionally interdependent and that the acquisition of HE by a proto-embecovirus allowed 101 its \u03b21CoV descendants to adopt strategies for reversible virion-sialoglycan attachment, remarkably 102 similar to those of influenza A viruses. RESULTS 104 Disruption of HE lectin function selects for mutations in S. To study the role and importance of HE in 105 \u03b21CoV propagation, we developed a reverse genetics system for BCoV strain Mebus (sFig. 1A) based 106 on targeted RNA recombination 41,42 . Recombinant 'wildtype' BCoVs (rBCoV) with parental type HE and 107 S, but with accessory ORF4a replaced by the Renilla luciferase gene (rBCoV-Rluc), were readily 108 generated upon seeding acceptor-virus-infected, donor RNA-transfected mouse LR7 cells onto 109 monolayers of feeder HRT18 cells. rBCoV-Rluc arose and within seven days grew to final titers 110 routinely obtained for wildtype BCoV (~10 8 TCID50/ml). 111 Generating BCoV-Rluc derivatives defective in HE lectin function proved more cumbersome. To 112 abolish the HE RBS, we substituted Phe 211 , which is key to ligand binding 17 (sFig. 1B), by Ala via two 113 nucleotide substitutions to block reversion. Mutant viruses were recovered eventually, but, in 3 out 114 of 4 successful trials, a multistep 160-hr rescue did not suffice and an additional 72-96 hr blind passage 115",

Surprisingly, the purified viruses all suffered single site 118 mutations in S, clustering in domain S1 A (aa 15-302) in proximity of the RBS (Figs. 1A-C; sFig. 2). Two 119 of the trials yielded multiple S variants and some variants -Thr 83 Ile and Leu 89 Pro-emerged 120 independently in separate experiments (Fig. 1A) . The mutations map to three distinct S RBS elements 121 (Fig. 1C, sFig. 2C ; nomenclature according to 32 ). Ile 26 Ser and Asn 27 Ser locate in the S1 A \u03b21 element 122 within the N-terminal L1-\u03b21-L2 segment (aa 15-33) that walls pocket P1; P1 is crucial for ligand binding 123 as it accommodates the all-important sialate-9-O-acetyl moiety 32,36 . Moreover, in the OC43 S cryo-EM 124 holostructure, the Asn 27 side chain hydrogen bonds with the 9-O-acetyl carbonyl 36 . Leu 89 Pro in S1 A 125 element 3101 is immediately adjacent to Trp 90 . The latter is arguably the most critical residue in the 126 RBS as its indole side chain separates the P1 and P2 pockets, and its replacement precludes receptor-127 binding and virus infectivity 32 . Finally, Gly 82 Glu and Thr 83 Ile substitutions occurred in S1 A element \u03b25 128 that interacts with the sialate carboxylate through hydrogen bonding with Lys 81 and Thr 83 . : bioRxiv preprint 7 As measured by solid phase lectin binding assay (sp-LBA) with S1 A -Fc fusion proteins and bovine 130 submaxillary mucin (BSM) as ligand, all mutations significantly reduced S binding to 9-O-Ac-Sia albeit 131 to widely different extents. S1 A -Fc binding affinities of the mutants were 500-fold (Asn 27 Ser) to more 132 than 10.000-fold (Ile 26 Ser; Gly 82 Glu) lower than that of parental BCoV S1 A -Fc (Fig. 1D) . 133 Loss of the HE lectin RBS would both abolish HE-assisted virion attachment to 9-O-Ac-Sia receptor 134 determinants as well as reduce virion-associated receptor-destroying sialate-O-acetylesterase activity 135 towards clustered glycotopes 11 . The findings suggest that the HE-Phe 211 Ala substitution creates a 136 fitness defect that can be alleviated not by increasing but by dramatically reducing the affinity of the 137 S RBS. Thus, the defect apparently is caused by loss of virion-associated RDE activity rather than by 138 loss of overall virion avidity.",

The observations led us to entertain the possibility that the mutations 269 in S1 A and HE did not occur independently and that, even in viruses expressing low affinity spikes, 270 partially restorative mutations in HE would yet provide a selective advantage. To test this, the clonal 271 S1 A -Thr 83 Asn/HE-Thr 114 Asn variants were serially passaged. All three viruses independently lost HE 272 Asn 114 glycosylation over time and, saliently, through Ser 116 Phe substitution exclusively. Even more 273 remarkably, with HE-Ser 116 Phe mutants gaining dominance, variants emerged that had restored S 274 affinity to (near)wildtype through substitution of S1 A -Asn 83 either by Thr or by Ser (Fig. 3E) . 275 For one of the five clonal populations obtained by endpoint dilution, we unfortunately failed to 276 determine its genotype for technical reasons. From the NGS analysis of the p1 population, we deduced 277 that the starting mutant must have been a low affinity S1 A -Leu 89 Pro variant that, like the S1 A -278 Thr 83 Asn/Ile variants described above, quickly lost the HE-Asn 114 glycan through an HE-Ser 116 Phe 279 substitution. Oddly enough, the Leu 89 Pro substitution had not been detected by NGS in the pre-cloning 280 virus stock. Note, however, that this mutation had been selected before twice independently in trials 281 with rBCoV-HE-F 211 A ( Table 2) . Possibly, it arose spontaneously during end point dilution procedure.",

Variants that combined the HE-Phe 211 Ala 357 mutation with (near) wildtype affinity S proteins increased to dominate the swarm at least 358 numerically. Still, these high affinity S variants for their proliferation were strictly reliant on minority 359 low affinity S variants. This relationship extends beyond cooperativity and group selection described360 for other systems 46-52 and amounts to a state of dependency. We propose that the virions of the low 361 affinity minority variants provide aid by serving as a source of exogenous sialate-O-acetylesterase 362 activity. They themselves evade decoy receptors through enhanced reversibility of virion attachment, 363 but this phenomenon increases their motility -whether by sliding diffusion or binding-rebinding-364 causing them to deplete cell surface 9-O-Ac-Sias, decoy receptors and functional receptors alike. With 365 increasing concentrations of low affinity virions in the culture supernatant, high affinity variants would 366 profit progressively, whereas falling cell surface receptor densities would put the low affinity viruses 367 increasingly at a disadvantage. 368 The forced evolution trials performed with rBCoV-HE-F 211 A were restricted in course and outcome by 369 design, because full reversion would require simultaneous mutation of two adjacent nucleotides. 370 Moreover, the crucial role of the Phe 211 in ligand binding (sFig. 1) obviates conservative substitutions 371 17 . Although rBCoV-HE A211V variants did emerge in two separate experiments, this mutation only 372 marginally increases HE RBS affinity and sialate-O-acetylesterase activity. 373 In contrast to the HE-Phe 211 Ala mutation, the deleterious effect of N-glycosylation at HE-Asn 114 can be 374 reversed, completely or partially, through various single-nucleotide substitutions in codons 114 and 375 116 and would therefore more readily allow for compensatory mutations also in HE.
