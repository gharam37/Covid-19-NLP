This epidemiological 'curve' refers to the cases versus time graph, which shows the rise of a disease to its peak before descending. The aim in a pandemic is to flatten this curve by reducing the peak and spreading out the timeline. However, the models used to predict this curve are often not clearly outlined, no model parameters are given, and models are not tested against real data. This lack of detail makes it difficult to recreate the curve. What is much needed is a simple tool for approximating the curve to allow ideas to be tested and comparisons made.",

For example, in the UK, the much cited Imperial College Report 2 has been used to guide national policy. Although the epidemiological curve is presented in this report, no details are given as to how it was produced, making it impossible to recreate. Nonetheless, the model is based on previous work 3 and has considerable merit. It uses population density, household data, school data, workplace data as well as commuting and travel data to ultimately construct the curve. This is certainly useful when modelling an epidemic in a country but is quite difficult to extend to a pandemic or to recreate for different diseases or populations.",

To estimate this, the time delay between infection and diagnosis and between infection and infectiousness need to be known or assumed. The difficulty with this model is twofold. Firstly, it requires a good understanding of epidemiology to produce the elusive 'curve', and secondly, it can be misled by incorrect assumptions of initial conditions, and any errors will quickly propagate through the model. 5 As a result, many authors and reporters have reverted to much simpler models, typically exponential increases. 6 However, these models break down as the curve begins to flatten, 7 either due to interventions or as a natural progression of the disease. The assumption that the infection rate will only increase is also leading to unrealistic figures reported in the media. 8 Between inactive governments and irresponsible sources underplaying the numbers and describing the virus as 'just the flu' 9 and the exponential models describing an apocalyptic scenario, 10 it is difficult to eke the truth out from the reporting.",

It also has the advantage of being defined by clearly understandable and adjustable parameters. This type of Gaussian model is in fact often used in epidemiological approximations, 13 and has been used to approximate other pandemics such as AIDS. 14 It should be noted that this model is only approximate, making it useful for visualisation but not for long-term predictions as was done in the AIDS study. 15 However, as presented in the results here, this model fits well to a fast-rising pandemic like COVID-19 and serves as a useful visualisation tool for approximating the curve.",

The width (FWHM) of the Chinese curve is likely to be narrower than countries affected later. As the virus spread to Italy after China, the peak day (p) will be later. Finally, the maximum number of cases recorded in any one day (M) is adjusted until the curve approximately fits the data. The Results are shown in Figure 6 . Besides the anomaly observed in China due to a redefinition of diagnosis, there are other issues with tracking cases. Some countries have rolled out significant testing measures which means that a vast number of cases are captured. Others have more recently had to curtail testing. There are also dates on which little or no data was recorded. This is more likely due to a glitch in the data gathering and reporting than a lack of cases on those days, as the subsequent day often captures this lost data.

In Italy, approximately 10% of infected patients were admitted to intensive care units daily during early to mid-March. 23 Before the construction of COVID-19 hospitals, the capacity of Italy's available critical care was around 5,200 beds. Using these approximations suggests that Italy's capacity for COVID-19 cases would have been 52,000. This intersects SCAT's curve on Day 82 (22 March 2020). As mentioned previously, case rates can become unreliable as testing and reporting becomes erratic in a crisis. Instead, looking at death rates can be useful as they can be extrapolated backwards. By 26 March 2020 (Day 86), Italy had reached a case fatality rate of 10%. This may suggest that there is a correlation between critical care bed occupancy and case fatality rate, as the typical survival time of non-survivors is 1-2 weeks. This also intersects SCAT's curve on Day 82 (22 March 2020) , showing a strong similarity to the previously approximated capacity. Figure 11 shows these lines on the case graphs.",
