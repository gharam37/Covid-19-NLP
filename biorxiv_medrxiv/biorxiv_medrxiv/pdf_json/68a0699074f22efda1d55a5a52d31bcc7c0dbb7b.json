Most were conducted in Asia (59%), in the hospital setting (79%), and examined the impact of the SARS epidemic (69%). The pooled prevalence was higher for anxiety (45%, 95% CI 21 to 69%; 6 studies, 3,373 participants), followed by depression (38%, 95% CI 15 to 60%; 7 studies, 3,636 participants), acute stress disorder (31%, 95% CI 0 to 82%, 3 studies , 2,587 participants), burnout (29%, 95% CI 25 to 32%; 3 studies; 1,168 participants), and post-traumatic stress disorder (19%, 95% CI 11 to 26%, 10 studies, 3,121 participants). Based on 37 studies, we identified factors associated with the likelihood of developing those problems, including sociodemographic (younger age and female gender), social (lack of social support, social rejection or isolation, stigmatization), and occupational (working in a high risk environment (frontline staff), specific occupational roles (e.g., nurse), and lower levels of specialised training, preparedness and job experience) factors. Five studies reported interventions for frontline HCW, two of which were educational and aimed to prevent mental health problems by increasing HCWs\u00b4 resilience. These interventions increased confidence in support and training, pandemic self-efficacy, and interpersonal problems solving (very low certainty). One multifaceted intervention implemented training and organisational changes) targeted at hospital nurses during the SARS epidemic, reporting improvements in .

Perceived safety, namely through access to protective equipment, and specialised training, mitigated those outcomes. 2 During December 2019 a new infectious disease outbreak was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, 4 which was named COVID-19. 5 The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic by March 11th 2020, and by 30 March 2020 it had spread to most countries and territories, with more than 693,000 known cases and a death toll of over 33,000 people. 6 Early anecdotal evidence from Wuhan showed how this unprecedented situation impacted the mental health of frontline HCWs, who reported mental problems such as anxiety, depressive symptoms, anger, and fear. 7 These problems cannot only have a long-lasting effect on the mental health of HCWs, 3 but also hinder the urgent response to COVID-19, by jeopardising attention and decision-making. 7 Tackling the mental health of HCWs during this pandemic is essential, and will strengthen healthcare systems' capacity. 8 Previous systematic reviews have explored social and occupational factors associated with psychological outcomes in HCW during an infectious disease outbreak, 2 and their perceptions of risk and use of coping strategies towards emerging respiratory infectious diseases. 9 However, to date, the impact of viral disease outbreaks on specific mental health problems and the effectiveness of interventions to ameliorate such impact have not been systematically reported.",

Occupational factors entailed working in a high risk environment (frontline staff), specific occupational roles (e.g., nurse), and having lower levels of specialized training, preparedness and job experience. In contrast with the high number of studies examining impact on mental health, there is limited evidence regarding the impact of interventions to reduce mental health problems in this particularly vulnerable population, and overall its certainty is very low, mainly due to study design and serious risk of bias.",

We followed the highest methodological standards when undertaking the current rapid review, 10 and we used the GRADE approach to evaluate the certainty of the evidence, in order to facilitate evidence-informed decision making processes. Our review team is also a strength, as it included experts in evidence synthesis, Cochrane authors, members of the GRADE Working Group, physicians, nurses, editors, psychologists, and psychiatrists.

Worry and degree of worry were significantly associated with intended absenteeism (P<0.0005), restriction of social contacts (P<0.0005), and psychological distress P= 0.036). The order of total general severity index (GSI) scores from high to low was EVD survivors, SL medical staff, SL logistic staff, SL medical students, and Chinese medical staff. There were 5 dimensions (obsession-compulsion, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, and paranoid ideation) extremely high in EVD survivors. GSI was inversely associated with university education. Depression (38.5% vs. 3.1%) and insomnia (37% vs. 9.7%) were greater in the SARS unit nurses than the non-SARS unit nurses. No difference was found in the prevalence of PTSD symptoms (33% vs. 18.7%), yet, three unit subjects (SARS ICU, SARS regular and Neurology) had significantly higher rate than those in CCU (29.7% vs. 11.8%, respectively) (P< 0.05). For the SARS unit nurses, significant reduction in mood ratings, insomnia rate and perceived negative feelings as well as increasing knowledge and understanding of SARS at the end of the study (all P< 0.001) indicated that a gradual psychological adaptation had occurred.",

The results of multinomial regression analyses showed that, with other relevant factors controlled for, being single, having been quarantined during the outbreak, having been exposed to other traumatic events before SARS, and perceived SARS-related risk level during the outbreak were found to increase the odds of having a high level of depressive symptoms 3 years later. Altruistic acceptance of risk during the outbreak was found to decrease the odds of high post-outbreak depressive symptom levels The lifetime prevalence of any depressive, anxiety, or substance use diagnosis was 30%. Only one HCW who identified the SARS experience as a traumatic event was diagnosed as having PTSD. New episodes of psychiatric disorders occurred among seven healthcare workers (5%).

However, having had family members or friends contract, SARS was not related to alcohol abuse/dependence symptom count. Symptoms of PTS and of depression, and having used drinking as a coping method, were also significantly associated with increased alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms. The relationship between outbreak exposure and alcohol abuse/dependence symptom count remained significant even when sociodemographic and other factors were controlled for. When the intrusion, avoidance and hyperarousal PTS symptom clusters were entered into the model, hyperarousal was found to be significantly associated with alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms All agreed SARS had changed their clinical practices. Significant anxiety was found in family doctors. Three quarters of respondents recalled requesting more investigations while a quarter believed they had over-prescribed antibiotics.

Coping scales were calculated as the mean of item scores on a 4 point scale from 0 (\"Not used\") to 4 (\"Used a great deal\"). Problem-solving and seeking support were both normally distributed. Cronbach's alpha was 0.76 for problemsolving and 0.77 for seeking support. Escape-avoidance was skewed toward zero. Cronbach's alpha 0.73.

Respondents who had been quarantined, or worked in high-risk locations such as SARS wards, or had friends or close relatives who contracted SARS, were 2 to 3 times more likely to have high PTS symptom levels, than those without these exposures. Respondents' perceptions of SARS-related risks were significantly positively associated with PTS symptom levels and partially mediated the effects of exposure. Altruistic acceptance of workrelated risks was negatively related to PTS levels.In 2003, high-risk health care workers had elevated stress levels (PSS-10 score = 17.0) that were not significantly different from levels in low-risk HCW control subjects (PSS-10 score=15.9). More high-risk HCWs reported fatigue, poor sleep, worry about health, and fear of social contact, despite their confidence in infection-control measures. By 2004, however, stress levels in the high-risk group were not only higher (PSS-10 score=18.6) but also significantly higher than scores among low-risk HCW control subjects (PSS-10 score=14.8, P<0.05).

SARS survivors had stress levels similar to those of non-HCWs, but HCWs showed significantly higher stress levels in 2004 (PSS-10 score=22.8, compared with PSS-10 score=18.4; P<0.05) and had higher depression (P<0.01), anxiety (P<0.001), posttraumatic symptoms (Intrusion P<0.001, Avoidance P<0.05 and Hyperarousal P<0.05), and GHQ-12 scores (P<0.001).In the initial phase of the outbreak, when the infection was spreading rapidly, feelings of extreme vulnerability, uncertainty and threat to life were perceived, dominated by somatic and cognitive symptoms of anxiety. During the 'repair' phase, when the infection was being brought under control, depression and avoidance were evident. Prevalence of psychiatric morbidity (CHQ) about 75%.

Summary of Findings table of studies of interventions to reduce impact of epidemic outbreaks on mental health of healthcare professionalsFace to face group training session, based on Folkman and Greer's model of coping. Content included: stressors associated with pandemic influenza (e.g., rapid spread of illness, rapidly changing state of knowledge, personal and family risk, social isolation); common concerns (e.g., family, burden of job stress); normal responses to extraordinary stress; evidence of the impact of SARSrelated stress on HCWs; organizational approaches to building resilience and reducing stress; individual approaches to coping and maintaining resilience; and resources for further support.A high proportion of participants found the session relevant to work life and personal life, useful, helpful, and informative. While most participants did not feel prepared to deal confidently with the pandemic before the session (N=356; 35%), there was a higher proportion of participants who felt better able to cope after the session (N=776; 76%) (Statistically significant difference: z=17.98, P=0.0020).Computer-assisted resilience training to prepare healthcare workers for pandemic influenza.

The course consisted of modules incorporating different modalities of learning. Knowledge-based modules addressed the topics listed below using audio and video minilectures accompanied by onscreen notes and printed fact sheets. Quizzes and games provided brief diversions and reinforced knowledge. Relaxation skills were taught with audio modules guiding participants in progressive muscle relaxation, relaxation breathing, imagery, and combined techniques. Self-assessment modules used psychological questionnaires to characterize interpersonal problem and coping style. Feedback was provided that was both individualized and relevant to the context.Comparison of doses showed improved interpersonal problems in the medium and long course but not in the short course. There was a trend towards higher drop-out rates with longer duration of training.SARS prevention program, based on information provided by WHO and Centers for Disease Control. The program included in-service training, manpower allocation, gathering sufficient protective equipment, and establishment of a mental health team. In order to guard against cross-infection in the hospital, several measures were taken with regard to handling procedure for SARS cases in general isolation room that included space, staff preparation, and environment.Statistically significant (P<0.05) improvements observed in nursing staff's anxiety and depression along with sleep quality after 2 weeks of the initiation of the SARS prevention program.The Anticipate, Plan and Deter (APD) Responder Risk and Resilience Model was designed to maximize the resilience of HCWs.

Results showed that HCWs commonly present high levels of anxiety, depression, PTSD, acute disorder and burnout, both during and after the outbreaks. We identified a broad number of risk factors for these conditions, including sociodemographic factors such as younger age and female gender, and social factors such as lack of social support, social rejection or isolation, stigmatization. Occupational factors entailed working in a high risk environment (frontline staff), specific occupational roles (e.g., nurse), and having lower levels of specialized training, preparedness and job experience. In contrast with the high number of studies examining impact on mental health, there is limited evidence regarding the impact of interventions to reduce mental health problems in this particularly vulnerable population, and overall its certainty is very low, mainly due to study design and serious Page 15 risk of bias.Limitations 25 Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).Despite searching on three major databases and that we manually searched references of previously published systematic reviews, we did not examine gray literature; hence, we cannot discard that relevant references may have been missed out. We observed high heterogeneity when pooling data, which could be partially attributed to the high variability across studies in terms of study population (e.g. occupational role), context (e.g. magnitude of the health emergency caused by epidemic) and outcome measures. In light of this, our results should be interpreted with caution.",
