In this patient, his viral shedding occurred on day 35, and persistent viral shedding could be observed on days 45-51, indicating active virus replication. Meanwhile, an excess production of cytokine IL-6 was observed on day 36, with rapid progression to the peak stage on day 47. Importantly, extensive lung damage was observed on the chest CT on day 35, but lesions were steadily resolved on days 41-48, with significant improvement on day 56 ( Figure 2) . A similar pattern could also be observed in other patients ( Supplementary Figures 4 and 5) . Thus, days of viral shedding and IL-6 concentrations were significantly correlated with the lung lesion evolution on the chest CT in severe COVID-19 patients.

In addition, it was found that the interval of viral shedding in patients with poor recovery was markedly prolonged. Importantly, both the IgM and IgG of SARS-CoV-2 in the patients with poor recovery remained positive during the late stage of the disease. This indicated that these patients might have active viral replication in the upper airway, and that persistent viral shedding might be directly linked to the poor recovery of patients with COVID-19. Supporting this notion, it was found that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA could persist until death in non-survivors 17 . Based on the delayed interval of viral shedding pattern and the serologic features of SARS-CoV-2, it is proposed that severe-condition patients with COVID-19 may need at least three negative PCR results with an interval of a few days. In addition, dynamic detection to improve the presence of IgM-negative should also be evaluated to guide discharge planning for COVID-19 patients.",

Since the IL-4 levels were slightly elevated in these patients, it was speculated that this might be due to the antagonistic effects of IL-4 during the active phase of the pro-inflammatory response. Importantly, it was found that the wave of the cytokine storm typically occurred during the active phase of viral infection, and a prolonged inflammatory response could be observed in severe patients with poor recovery.

However, it was found that corticosteroid therapy was closely associated with the poor recovery of severely infected patients. Therefore, corticosteroids should be administrated with great caution if necessary. In addition to the viral shedding, other risk factors for slower recovery in severe COVID-19 patients were also identified. Consistent with previous studies 19, 20 , it was confirmed that older age, hypoproteinemia, and increased levels of LDH were associated with the poor clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. In particular, older age, hyperlipemia, hypoproteinemia, corticosteroid therapy, and increased levels of FIB and TG were associated with the poor recovery of COVID-19 patients. Up-todate information regarding the risk factors associated with lung lesion resolution in severe-condition COVID-19 patients is scarce. The clinical data in this study suggested that all of the patients had lung lesions on chest CT, and the consolidation pattern on chest CT was closely associated with poor recovery. Intriguingly, prognostic factors, including hyperlipemia and hypoproteinemia, were also closely linked to the odds of impaired lung lesion resolution.

As of March 17, 2020, 29 patients were still hospitalized with multifocal lesions on the chest CT. A few of them were still in the active phase of viral infection, with intermittent viral shedding and pulmonary fibrosis. It remained unknown whether these patients would develop chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection or be viral carriers. Further follow-up studies in these patients is highly warranted to determine the long-term clinical outcome of severe patients with COVID-19.",

In addition, this study provides convincing evidence of the virologic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, thus it greatly expands our understanding of the natural history of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, this study provides helpful management strategies for COVID-19 patients and can help to control the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study does have some limitations. First, only 50 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included. It would be better to include a larger number of cases to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of COVID-19. Second, the serologic tests kits for SARS-CoV-2 were available on March 8, 2020, thus the dynamic serologic pattern of SARS-CoV-2 during the early stage was not obtained. Third, the cytokine test results at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection was also not obtained, thus the initial inflammation and immune response profile in severely infected patients remains unclear.",
