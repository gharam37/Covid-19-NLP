The continued increase in the number of cases with COVID-19 and the number of affected countries over time are of great concern. On February 28, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the international risk assessment for the COVID-19 outbreak from \"high\" to \"very high\" nearly a month after the novel coronavirus was declared a public health emergency of international concern, which is the WHO's highest level alarm. 1 As of April 13, 2020 , the global number of reported cases of COVID-19 has reached 1 773 084, with 83 597 cases in China and 1 689 487 cases outside of China. 2 Hubei Province was the center of the epidemic area in the early stage of the pandemic. As of April 13, 2020, 6 7803 confirmed cases with COVID-19 were reported in Hubei Province, 2 which accounted for over 80% of the cases in China, and the case fatality rate in Hubei Province was five times greater than in areas outside of Hubei Province. 3 Moreover, approximately 26% of cases developed severe disease in Hubei Province which accounted for 98% of the severe cases in China. Guangdong Province had the second largest number of confirmed cases with COVID-19 in China outside of Hubei, with 1 564 reported cases as of April 13, 2020. 2 Based on the clinical characteristics reported by patients with COVID-19, around 80% of the patients were diagnosed with mild or moderate COVID-19 and a part of those will develop severe disease rapidly. 4, 5 The median time from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases is approximately two weeks, and it is three to six weeks for patients with severe or critical COVID-19. 4 Previous studies found that older patients with underlying chronic illnesses, such as hypertension and diabetes, are more likely to develop severe pneumonia.

[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Preliminary data from the WHO suggest that the time interval from onset of symptoms to the development of severe disease is one week. 4 Thus, efficient and timely management of patients with a high risk of developing severe COVID-19 is crucial in the face of severe resource constraints. Currently, there are no effective prediction tools for the early stratification of COVID-19 patients according to different risks of clinical deterioration. We therefore conducted this study with the aim to develop and validate an early warning score for predicting the clinical course of patients with COVID-19. We hypothesized that this score could be used as an efficient and widely applicable evaluation tool to prioritize managing patients with a high risk of developing severe to critical COVID-19 at an early stage.",

Our findings show that the early-warning score can be useful in the assessment of the 14-day risk of clinical deterioration in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 at admission. A major advantage of this score is that it is practical and easy to use in routine clinical practice, based on patient's age, history of chronic disease, NLR, CRP, and D-dimer. It can therefore be widely applicable in many health care settings globally. Although there were several differences in the characteristics of the patients in the training and validation datasets, this strengthens the reliability of our score, which was shown to offer similar predictability in different patient populations.",

The most common chronic diseases in our cohort were hypertension, pre-existing cardiac conditions, chronic lung disease and diabetes, which had prevalence rates of 12.6%, 12.2%, 7.3% and 5.5% in the training cohort, respectively. These comorbidities are found to be important risk factors in previously reported seriously ill or non-survival COVID-19 patients. In addition, patients with these illnesses may receive angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatments. These regimens increase the expression of ACE2, which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and may contribute to disease progression. 15, 16 One of the reported early general manifestations in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection is lymphocytopenia in the presence of a normal WBC count and more prominent abnormalities in lymphocyte counts are identified in patients with more severe pneumonia. In the present study, a correlation between a higher neutrophil count and early deterioration was also observed. Hence, we included the NLR in the multivariable regression analysis. Additionally, NLR is used as a predictor of community acquired pneumonia (CAP), specifically in elderly patients. [17] [18] [19] CRP is a common indicator of the inflammatory response. Its prediction value of disease progression has been reported in MERS, influenza-infected and CAP patients. [20] [21] [22] In our study, a CRP level higher than 25 mg/L at admission may indicate an underlying secondary infection or an intense inflammatory response that may lead to disease progression in the short term. Another factor, D-dimer, is associated with coagulation activation, which has been previously been reported to be a common finding in COVID-19 patients who had severe illness or died. Additionally, elevated D-dimer is one of the risk factors for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), progression from ARDS to death or early in-hospital death in COVID-19 patients. 23, 24 The possible mechanisms include ischemia and thrombosis caused by systemic proinflammatory cytokine responses, which are reported to be mediators of atherosclerosis All rights reserved.

Under these pressing clinical circumstances, high quality and timely evidence-based guidance becomes especially crucial. EWAS, with a high level of differentiating power, can be regarded as such quality evidence in providing an efficient, feasible and practical approach to establish a hierarchical management system of COVID-19 in highly endemic SARS-CoV-2 areas where medical resources are extremely limited. Specifically, it is suggested that, by applying the EWAS, patients classified in the low-risk group should be isolated and treated in \"mobile cabin hospitals\", an isolation facility converted from sports stadiums, convention centers, etc. with structures easily installed which can accommodate large numbers of patients. Patients in the medium-risk group should be treated in the general wards, whereas patients in the high-risk group should be transferred to the intensive care unit for more comprehensive treatment due to the high risk of clinical deterioration within 14 days of admission being as high as approximately 40% in this group. It is predicted that this approach would benefit a considerable number of patients with COVID-19 by directing the appropriate level of medical resources according to the severity of the disease, thus reducing mortality and saving valuable medical and socioeconomic resources.",
