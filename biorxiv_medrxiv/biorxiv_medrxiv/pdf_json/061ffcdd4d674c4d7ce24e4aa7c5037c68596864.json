By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and lymphocyte reduction were three important independent risk factors predicting ALI among COVID-19 patients. Death risk analysis shows that fatality rate was higher among patients with hypoproteinemia than those without hypoproteinemia (RR=9.471, P<0.001). Moreover, fatality rate was higher among patients with cholestasis than those without cholestasis (RR=2.182, P<0.05).",

Despite of no difference on serum TBA, alkaline phosphatase and glutamyl transferase, two markers of cholestasis, were higher in critically ill patients than those of common cases. The association between oxygenation index and hepatic functional indexes was analyzed.

Moreover, the fatality rate was higher in COVID-19 patients with cholestasis than without cholestasis. Our results suggest that hypoproteinemia and cholestasis at the early stage elevate death risk of COVID-19 patients. It is especially interesting whether SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI recovers in a short time after discharge. In the present study, 150 COVID-19 patients were followed up and measured hepatic functions 14 days after discharge. Unexpectedly, no significant difference on the values of serum direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, TBA, alkaline phosphatase, glutamyl transferase and AST was observed when admission and 14 days after discharge. Although serum albumin level was rebounded on 14 days after discharge, 17% COVID-19 patients remained below normal range.

These results suggest that respiratory failure may contribute, at least partially, to SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI. Several studies demonstrated that ACE2, as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, was expressed in cholangiocytes and hepatocytes [26, 27] . Therefore, this study does not exclude that SARS-CoV-2 evokes ALI partially through infecting liver. It is required to further explore whether human liver is another target of SARS-CoV-2 injection.",

Our results revealed that SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI was more common in critically ill patients. In addition, male elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus and lymphopenia were more susceptible to ALI. We provide evidence that ALI at the early stage elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI has not recovered completely 14 days after discharge. Therefore, it is necessary to further evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection causes permanent liver injury. ",
