We demonstrate how 347 optimal designs can vary in relation to epidemiological characteristics of the target disease; in 348 this case, the rate of decrease in correlation of disease prevalence rates over distance, which 349 determines whether prevalence changes abruptly or smoothly over the spatial domain. 350 We first describe the demonstration setting, the data available for design optimization, 351 the specification and parameterization of the disease and surveillance system models, and the 352 resulting formalized objective functions for optimizing spatial predictions and effect estimation. 353 We demonstrate the use of an exhaustive search strategy to find the single most optimal site to 354 add to the existing network for both goals, as well as the Pareto-optimal set of single sites to 355 add when considering both objectives simultaneously. We simulate the addition of an arbitrary 356 number of sites, acknowledging that in real-world applications of the framework, the number of 357 sites might be determined by budgetary constraints and/or the marginal informational gains per 358 added site. We conclude our demonstration by considering the best set of three sites to add, 359 which introduces substantial combinatorial complexity, motivating the use of a metaheuristic 360 algorithm to efficiently search for optimal regions of design space. 361 362 363 We generated a set of 100 potential surveillance sites scattered uniformly at random 364 across a unit grid, and randomly selected 30 sites to represent a virtual existing surveillance 365 network. We seeded two point sources for a risk factor influencing expected disease prevalence 366 rates (Figure 2A) , then simulated disease prevalence under two scenarios of spatial auto-367 correlation by adjusting the scale parameter ( ) of a log-Gaussian spatial process centered on a 368 linear function of the risk factor.

However, when the optimization question is shifted to the best three sites to add, 449 the design space expands to 54,740 combinations, making sequential enumeration a 450 prohibitively expensive search strategy. Under these conditions, heuristic (greedy) or 451 metaheuristic algorithms play an important role in finding the optimal or near-optimal solution 452 within a reasonable amount of time [47] . Moreover, the evaluation of objective function values 453 across realizations can be paralleled to further reduce computational time. 454 We illustrate the use of a simulated annealing (SA) meta-heuristic algorithm popular in 455 spatial sampling network design [48, 49] to more efficiently explore the design space when three 456 sites are to be added. In SA, a random initial design is proposed, after which, at each iteration, a 457 new design is sampled from the neighborhood of the current design and the objective function 458 value (OFV) for the new design is evaluated. Here, the neighborhood of a set of n sites to enroll 459 is defined as designs sharing n-1 sites with the current design. If the new OFV is superior to the 460 current OFV, the new design is accepted as the next design; otherwise, it is accepted with a 461 probability of \u2212 \u2206 , where \u2206 is the change in the OFV and T is a tuning parameter 462 analogous to temperature [50] . T decreases at a rate \u03b1 after each iteration, causing SA to 463 accept deterioration in the OFV more frequently at the beginning of the run and rarely towards 464 the end. Probabilistically accepting worse solutions early in the search enables the algorithm to 465 escape local optima. For our demonstration, we set the initial temperature T0 and cooling rate \u03b1 466 separately for each objective and epidemiologic scenario, following suggestions by Sait and 467 Youssef [50] , and set the stopping criteria is to be T\u226410 -6 . We repeat the SA process 3 times to 468 examine the convergence of the result. 469 470",

The mean squared error 472 of spatial predictions across unenrolled sites (OFV1) is minimized by enrolling sites that are in 473 close proximity to multiple out-of-network sitesespecially clusters of unmeasured sites at 474 long distances from existing network locations (Figure 3 , panels A and B). These optimal 475 placements address informational gaps by enrolling sites that increase the average covariance 476 between measured and unmeasured locations, and tend to fall in areas close to several 477 unenrolled sites but away from the initially enrolled locations. Furthermore, the amount of 478 information that can be inferred from the same set of neighboring sites increases with the scale 479 parameter \u03c1. Thus, in the spatially patchy disease scenario, where the scale of spatial 480 autocorrelation is small, optimal placement occurs in the center of a tight cluster of unenrolled 481 sites (Figure 3, panel A) . Under the spatially smooth scenario, the same cluster is correlated 482 with initially enrolled sites, and optimal site placement falls in the center of a loose cluster of 483 unmeasured sites located quite far from the initial network (Figure 3, panel B) . Under the 484 parameter values used to generate demonstration data, there is no clear influence of risk factor 485 level X on site selection to optimize spatial prediction. 486",
