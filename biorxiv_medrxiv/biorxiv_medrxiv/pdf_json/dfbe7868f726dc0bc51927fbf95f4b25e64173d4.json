Crude mortality ratio (no. of reported deaths divided by reported cases) is between 3-4%. The infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infection) will be lower than seasonal influenza (0\u00b71%). Globally there are 6,68,690 confirmed cases; 31,065 deaths and so far 1,43,107 people recovered in 199 countries and territories. 3, 4 The most vulnerable group in corona epidemic is elderly, malnourished, hypertensive, diabetic, immune compromised, cancer and cardiovascular patients, as well as pregnant women. Despite wide spread COVID-19 infection, the numbers of fatally infected children cases are less reported so far, possible mechanism might be an unknown protective interaction between immune system and respiratory pathway. 5 COVID-19 spreads through droplet infection and fomites, from infected person during coughing and sneezing. Majority of symptoms are sore throat, breathing difficulty and fever, although GI and musculoskeletal system are also involved. 6,7 Clinical course is somehow showing a predictable pattern. On around day five, flu like symptom starts, common are fever, headache, dry cough, myalgia (and back pain), nausea (without vomiting), abdominal discomfort with some diarrhea, loss of smell, anorexia and fatigue. Around same time symptoms can worsen leading to shortness of breath due to bilateral viral pneumonia from direct viral damage to lung parenchyma. Around day10, cytokine storm kicks in, subsequently acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ failure ensues. This degradation usually happens in matter of hours. Hospitalized patients in moderate to severe cases usually come in hypoxic stage without dyspnea. China reported 15% cardiac involvement and serious final outcome. In most of the chest X-rays, bilateral interstitial pneumonia or ground glass opacities are seen. Hypoxia mostly does not correlate well with the chest x-ray findings. Chest auscultations are not of great help. Blood reports show, in the most cases, WBC is low, i.e. mostly lymphocytopenia, low platelet count whereas pro-calcitonin are mostly normal. Most consistently, CRP and ferritin levels are elevated and similarly CPK, D-dimer, LDH, ALKphos/AST-ALT levels are also high. It has been seen a ratio of absolute neutrophil count to absolute lymphocyte count, greater than 3.5, may be the highest predictor of poor outcome. An elevated level of IL-6 is of grave concern of cytokine storm. 8,9",

It has been found that S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 10-20 times more likely to bind to human ACE2 than the S protein of the early 2000s SARS-CoV strain. ACE2 is essentially a carboxypeptidase, which can remove carboxy-terminal of hydrophobic or basic amino acids. The expression of ACE2 is comparatively higher in mouth and tongue and is also normally expressed in human lower lungs on type-I and type-II alveolar epithelial cells. The heightened affinity for a prevalent cellular receptor may be a factor which increases a quick transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract. As an RNA virus, 2019-nCoV has the inherent feature of a high mutation rate. Due to mutations and recombination effects, different viral strains are originating with new characteristics; however because of its genome encoded exonuclease, the mutation rate might be somewhat lower than other RNA viruses. 12, 14 In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the whole genome sequence homology from the available patient data uploaded by affected countries in NCBI Virus database, identified the mutations developed by different strains from the ancestor strain and studied the impact of those mutations at functional level. Our endeavour was to categorize all the strains into major groups depending upon their lethal effect and mutations observed.",

The analysis with different SNP annotation tools like SIFT, 16 SNAP, 17 Polyphen2, 18 MetaSNP 19 showed the functional impact of NS mutations at different level, predicting either tolerance of the mutation, or disease causing ability, or executing risk or damage, which altogether can infer the fatality rate.",

We screened and compared extent of mutations observed in genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2. All reported genome sequences of 13 affected countries have been analyzed. So far, studies indicated that there are only two strains, S, possibly the ancestral one and L, might be the lethal and more aggressive one. The distinct clusters that we observed from our phylogenetic tree construction raise the assumption of existence of many more unknown strains (figure 5). One interesting report substantiating our finding is from Shenzhen which showed possible generation of new strain which neither belongs to 'S' nor to 'L' subtype. 12 We evaluated the extent of molecular divergence by MSA and Pair-wise alignment and subsequently tried to decipher the protein alteration parallel to the mutations.",

It was found that similar number of mutations does not correlate well with similar extent of fatality outcome. Example, patients from Australia, Japan and Italy all show 3 mutations in the viral genome, but Australia has least fatality rate, while Italy has maximum. Again, numbers of mutations are 5 in China, 6 in India and 7 in both Sweden and Spain. The observations mentioned above strongly indicate that not the total number of mutation, but the nature of mutations finally guides the overall fatality outcome. In the case of Italy, we found three deadly mutations in 2020 (i.e. 2269 A>T, very rare allele; 11083 G>A, very rare allele and . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . 26144 G>T) with high disease outcome but the wild counterpart of these found in 2003 did not lead to any fatality, suggesting the significance of newly evolved mutations. Although, 2269 A>T mutation does not alter amino acid (A668A), increasing number of evidences suggest that synonymous mutations could have effects on splicing, transcription, that ultimately alter the phenotype, disrupting their silence. 22 Spain is also carrying a very rare allele transversion T>A, that occurs in orf1ab gene of virus. Orf1ab gene transcribes into a polyprotein and cleaving by protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) produces several non-structural proteins, which are important for replication as well as virulence for coronavirus. Thus, an alteration in this region might alter the virulence, and associated fatality outcome.",

Herein, we tried to elucidate the possible interaction between ACE2 and spike glycoprotein. It is well established that for virus entry, spike glycoprotein (S) present on the CoV can be a neutralization antibody and it binds to its receptor followed by membrane fusion. It has been inferred that some favorable changes in viral glycoprotein may limit the increase of fatality. This kind of favorable mutation was found in some strains of COVID-19 from India, Australia and Sweden. Detailed screening depicted that Australian strain carry a rare allele transversion (T>G) which results into a NS mutation (S256R) on surface glycoprotein S1 domain which may affect the binding of hACE2 molecules, thus these strains become non-lethal to human. In this study, only one tri-nucleotide deletion at S1 domain of surface glycoprotein has been found and that is found in Indian strains along with a NS mutation (R417I) in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of S1 subunit that disfavor viral entry by inhibiting hACE2 interaction.",
