The IL-1R antagonist, Anakinra significantly inhibited IL-1\u03b2-induced p-NF-kB in the CCR6 + T cells and CD11c mDCs with a trending inhibition in CD14 monocytes and Lin -CD161 + CD25 + cells.

All PBMC samples had viability in the range of 85-98%. 1-2 x 10 6 cells per stimulation were used. Prior to IL-1\u03b2 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) stimulation, PBMCs were rested in 1.8 ml low retention eppendorf tubes (Fisherbrand) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 . At the end of the stimulation period, PFA (1.6% final concentration) methanol free, Ultra Pure EM grade, Polysciences, Inc) was immediately added to the PBMC suspension, mixed by vortexing, and cells were incubated at RT for 10 minutes. PFA was then diluted at least to 0.8% or lower with ice-cold Maxpar Cell Staining Buffer (CSB) (Fluidigm), and fixed cells were centrifuged at 800 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes at RT. PBMC samples were barcoded using the palladium-based 20-Plex Pd Barcoding Kit (Fluidigm) according to the manufacturer's protocol. As PBMCs were fixed with PFA, which is similar to the Maxpar Fix I Buffer, this step was excluded and cells were washed twice with 1 ml of 1x Maxpar Barcode Perm Buffer. Barcoded cells were then combined into a single tube prior to Fc receptor blocking (BD Biosciences) and staining with a cocktail of metal-conjugated antibodies against cell-surface markers for 30 minutes at RT with frequent gentle shaking. After washing once with the CSB, cells were resuspended in residual CSB and chilled on ice for 5 minutes. For cell permeabilization, 0.5 ml of 100% ice-cold methanol was added to the cells, and samples were vortexed and incubated on ice for 10 minutes.

After washing, cell were fixed with 2% PFA for 10 minutes at RT, washed again and cell pellet stored overnight at 4\u00b0C.

            "text": "Cytokine storm is suspected of producing the overzealous immune response driving the severe cardiopulmonary complications that are fueling the high morbidity and mortality rates in certain COVID-19-infected individuals 1, 2 . Cytokine storm or macrophage activation syndrome or secondary haemophagocytic lyphohistocytosis has previously been described as a serious complication in other clinical contexts including individuals with rheumatologic disorders such as systemic onset juvenile inflammatory arthritis also known as Still's disease 3 , sepsis 4 , and CAR-T cell therapy 5 . IL-1\u03b2 is one of the key inflammatory cytokines implicated in the cytokine storm syndrome 4, 6, 7 . Inhibition of IL-1\u03b2induced cellular signaling with the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) antagonist, Anakinra, has shown promise in treating cytokine storm and is proposed as a potential therapy for subjects with this severe complication of COVID-19 [8] [9] [10] 11 . Yet, little is known about the immune cell subtypes most vulnerable to IL-1\u03b2induced inflammatory signals in humans. New technologies, such as mass cytometry (CyTOF), have emerged as powerful analytic tools to identify unique cell phenotypes associated with specific inflammatory stimuli and their inhibitors [12] [13] [14] . CyTOF uses antibodies conjugated to isotopes of rareearth metals not found in human cells, so it eliminates background signal and minimizes signal overlap, allowing for the identification of a greater number of proteins that more precisely define cellular identify and activation states. These novel, customized approaches hold promise for the discovery of the cellular mechanisms mediating IL-1\u03b2-induced pathologies and the identification of sensitive and specific biomarkers that could be used to assist in early identification of cytokine storm and those who may response to specific therapies such as IL-1\u03b2 or IL-1R inhibitors.",

Notably, the majority of these are murine studies. Based on these findings, we developed a customized 35 antibody IL-1\u03b2-response CyTOF panel to generate the first comprehensive atlas of IL-1\u03b2-induced signaling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in humans. Results demonstrated that IL-1\u03b2 rapidly induces p-NF-kB and p-p38 in distinct effector memory (EM) T subsets, monocytes, dendritic cells (DC), natural killer (NK) cells and lineage-(Lin -)CD161 + CD25 + cells. IL-1\u03b2induced increase in p-p38 was much less robust than p-NF-kB. In contrast to the rapid increase of p-NF-kB with only 15 minutes of IL-1\u03b2 stimulation, prolonged stimulation for one hour greatly increased p-STAT3 and to a lesser extent p-STAT1 and p-STAT5 in subsets of T cells, monocytes, DCs and Lin -CD161 + CD25 + cells. Notably, we identified CCR6 as a marker to distinctly identify T cells most responsive to IL-1\u03b2. The IL-1R antagonist Anakinra significantly inhibited IL-1\u03b2-induced p-NF-kB in the CCR6 + T cells and CD11c myeloid DCs (mDC) with only a trending inhibition in CD14 monocytes and Lin -CD161 + CD25 + cells. This knowledge of the cell types, unique markers enriched on responsive cells and temporal expression of inflammatory signaling molecules in response to IL-1\u03b2 stimulation in humans provides unique information that may be used to discover new approaches to limit IL-1\u03b2-Data obtained from the Helios instrument were in the form of .fcs files format. Samples were normalized using the Nolan lab MATLAB normalizer (http://github.com/nolanlab/bead-normalization/releases) and debarcoded using Zunder's lab debarcoder 24 (https://github.com/zunderlab/single-cell-debarcoder).",

While T cells, monocytes and DCs in the vehicle-treated samples showed basal levels of p-NF-kB, p-p38 and p-ERK, IL-1\u03b2 stimulation led to a marked upregulation of p-NF-kB expression prominently in the CD4 and CD4 -CD8 low T cell subsets (Fig. 1e ). Additionally, a modest level of IL-1\u03b2induced p-NF-kB expression was observed in the CD11c mDCs and NK cells. IL-1\u03b2 induced p-p38 expression primarily in CD14 monocytes and to a lower extent in CD11c mDCs and CD4 T cells. IL-1\u03b2 did not induce p-ERK expression in any immune cell type, and B cells were relatively unresponsive to IL-1\u03b2 stimulation (Fig. 1e) .

However, mean expression of IL-1R1 was significantly lower in the p-NF-kB + memory T cells in comparison to the p-NF-kBmemory T cells (Fig. 3a) . IL-1\u03b2 signaling can induce receptor internalization 30 yet, there was no reduction in the mean expression of surface IL-1R1 after 15 minutes of IL-1\u03b2 stimulation in both the p-NF-kBand p-NF-kB + memory T cell subsets ( Fig.   3a) . Cell surface IL-1R2 binds to IL-1\u03b2 but acts as a decoy receptor 31 . As such, the ratio of the levels of IL-1R1 and IL-1R2 on the cell surface may determine the signaling outcome induced by IL-1\u03b2. Therefore, we also analyzed expression of IL-1R2 on the p-NF-kB + and p-NF-kBmemory T cells. IL-1R2 expression could not be detected on T cells or any other immune cell type in both vehicle-treated and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated PBMCs. Notably, the same IL-1R2 antibody clone measured IL-1R2 expression on CD4 memory T cells activated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28 and IL-2 for 48 hours. Unstimulated cells in culture also showed moderate levels of IL-1R2 expression, yet it was undetectable on unstimulated freshly purified PBMCs (Supplementary Fig. 8) .",

Yet, unlike lineage markers such as CD4, CD8 and CD45RO, CCR6 median expression was moderate, raising the interesting possibility that there may be a range of CCR6 expression in these T cell subtypes, and that CCR6 may mark those most prone to activation in response to IL-1\u03b2. To test this, we gated total CD3 T cells into CCR6and CCR6 + populations and analyzed expression of p-NF-kB and p-p38 in these subsets. Indeed, remarkably higher frequencies of p-NF-kB + and p-p38 + T cells were present within the T cells that expressed CCR6 as compared to those that do not ( Fig. 3b-e) . Moreover, the majority (61.5 \u00b1 2.75%) of the CCR6 + memory T cells that showed IL-1\u03b2-induced expression of p-NF-kB or p-p38 coexpressed CCR2 and CD26 (Fig. 3f) .",

As shown in the Supplementary Fig. 10a , while cluster 17 cells expressed similar levels of CD25 as the T cells, this cluster was negative for CD3, CD4 and CD8 excluding the possibility that these are T cells.

This data suggests involvement of the NF-kB pathway in the autocrine IL-1\u03b2 signaling that may lead to continued production of IL-1\u03b2 under chronic inflammatory conditions. Within the NK subsets, IL-1\u03b2 induced expression of p-NF-kB in the CD16 -CD56 dim CD161 + (cluster 2) and CD16 -CD56 bright CD161cells (cluster 3). CD161 is a C-type lectin receptor and CD161 expression divides circulating NK cells in healthy adults into two distinct populations, with ~80% cells being CD161 + 88 . Both CD56 bright and CD56 dim subsets comprise CD161 + cells. Notably, CD161 + NK cells within the CD56 dim subset produced more IFN-\u03b3 than their CD161counterpart, were more proliferative and showed an increased responsiveness to IL-12 and IL-18 88 . Furthermore, a higher frequency of the CD161 + NK cells were present in the inflamed intestinal lamina propria of patients with inflammatory bowel disease 88 . Here, using the high-dimensional approach, we have identified a subset of CD161 + NK cells with dim expression of CD56 that responds to IL-1\u03b2 stimulation. It would be interesting to investigate if our cluster 2 shares phenotypic and functional properties with that of the CD161 + NK cells identified by Kurioka et al 88 or constitute a separate subset that responds specifically to IL-1\u03b2.",

Moreover, the majority (~80%) of the cells in cluster 17 were CD56 -. Interestingly, cluster 17 showed a robust induction of p-NF-kB, p-p38 as well as activation of STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 at later time points. Human innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) also express CD161 89 and Ohne et al. 22 demonstrated that IL-1\u03b2 plays a critical role in inducing proliferation, cytokine production, maturation and plasticity of human ILC2. IL-1\u03b2 mediated these effects in combination with IL-2 and/or IL-12, and NF-kB inhibition blocked IL-1\u03b2-induced responses 22 . Notably, p-NF-kB + cells within our cluster 17 bear resemblance to the phenotype of the ILC2. Consistent with the higher expression of CD127 in the ILC2 cells as compared to the CD56 bright NK cells as shown by Ohne et al., 22 the p-NF-kB + cells within cluster 17 expressed higher CD127 than the p-NF-kB + cells within the CD56 bright NK cells (cluster 3) (Supplementary Fig. 10d) .

            "text": "IL-1\u03b2 is an apical proinflammatory cytokine that exacerbates inflammation through activating both innate and adaptive immune cells and production of a variety of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Indeed, induction of p-STAT1, p-STAT3 and p-STAT5 expression across multiple immune cell subtypes after prolonged IL-1\u03b2 stimulation indicates signaling mediated by secondary mediators such as IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, IL-17A. Robust induction of p-NF-kB expression in the CCR6 + EM T cells, CD11c mDC and the Lin -CD161 + CD25 + cells indicate that these cell types may play an important upstream role in IL-1\u03b2-mediated inflammation including cytokine storm. author/funder.

Together, these provide key data for the study and design of more targeted approaches to chronic inflammatory diseases that may lessen adverse effects. Moreover, our work has clear implications for the development of immune phenotypic approaches to identify COVID-19 subjects at higher risk of cytokine storm and those most likely to benefit from therapies targeting IL-1\u03b2 or its downstream mediators such as IL-6.

Note: markers including chemokine receptors, CD161, CD11b, CD11c and others are expressed on more than one cell type. b, Experimental design. c, SPADE analysis was performed using cell surface markers to identify 200 cell clusters using 10% down-sampling. SPADE tree showing median expression (blue to red depicting low to high) of the indicated lineage markers. The size of each node is proportional to the number of cells in that population. d, 9 immune cell types were identified: Total T cells were identified as CD3 + , and subsets as CD4 + , CD8 + and CD4 -CD8 low , B cells as CD19 + , NK cells as CD56 + CD16 + , monocyte subsets as HLA-DR + CD14 + and HLA-DR + CD16 + and DCs as HLA-DR + CD11c + and HLA-DR + CD123 + . Scale: Color blue to red within each cluster corresponds to low to high cell count. e, Representative SPADE tree from a donor showing IL-1\u03b2-induced expression of p-NF-kB, p-p38 and p-ERK.

Increased frequency of CD4 EM T cells are associated with increased disease activity and severity[37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44] . Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that T cell intrinsic IL-1R signaling acts as a licensing signal for cytokine production by memory CD4 T cells and that this critical cue is conserved across all EM lineages 17 . IL-1\u03b2 enhanced post-transcriptional stability of effector cytokines such as TH17 cytokines, IL-5 and IL-13 via the p38 MAPK pathway in the murine CD4 EM T cells 17 . Other studies, mostly murine, also demonstrated that IL-1\u03b2 is crucial for proinflammatory cytokine production by CD4 EM T cells through activation of NF-kB, p38 and JNK15,16,[18][19][20][21] . Consistent with these studies, our CyTOF analyses in human immune cells demonstrated IL-1\u03b2-induced signaling predominantly in the CD4 EM subsets including TH17, Tfh and MTregs. IL-1\u03b2-induced expression of p-NF-kB was more robust as compared to p-p38 expression. Our data suggests that NF-kB inflammatory pathway may play a more prominent role in IL-1\u03b2-mediated regulation of functions of the CD4 EM T subsets in humans. Murine CD4 + CXCR5 hi CD25 -Tfh cells express IL-1R1, and IL-1\u03b2 triggers in vivo expansion of these Tfh cells and induces production of IL-4 and IL-21, the two major B cell activating cytokines45 . To our knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate that IL-1\u03b2 induces NF-kB activation in the human Tfh cells, potentially providing new mechanistic insight into IL-1\u03b2-mediated dysregulated humoral response in patients with autoimmune diseases 46 .",

Further supporting this notion is the study by Turtle et al., which demonstrated that IL-1\u03b2 in cooperation with T cell receptor signaling enhances cell proliferation and IL-17 secretion in human CD8\u03b1 + CD161 high cells52 . While MAIT cells play an important role in protective immunity to pathogens, emerging evidence support their pathogenic role in chronic inflammatory, metabolic and autoimmune pathologies[53][54][55][56][57][58][59] .MAIT cells express high levels of tissue-targeted chemokine receptors50 and display an activated proinflammatory TH17 phenotype 59 .

Further work is warranted to establish the identity of the CD4 -CD8 -CD161 high and CD4 -CD8 + CD161 high cells (cluster 8) that showed IL-1\u03b2-induced expression of p-NF-kB and p-p38, and investigate how IL-1\u03b2 modulates their effector functions.",

Interestingly, while Tregs are largely anti-inflammatory, a proportion of the circulating MTregs in healthy humans express high levels of RORC and secrete IL-17 69 . IL-1\u03b2 together with IL-23 plays a critical role in human TH17 cell development and regulation of TH17 cytokines 70-73 . It is possible that the cells within the CCR6 + EM T cell population that respond to IL-1\u03b2 bear a TH17-like characteristic. Abundant evidence implicate TH17 cells and sustained production of IL-17 in the pathogenesis of diverse inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 74-80 . Increased frequency of TH17 cells and higher levels of TH17 cytokines have been reported in patients with inflammatory diseases and blocking the IL-17 pathway has shown potential benefit in some inflammatory diseases 74,76,78,81,82 . IL-17 confers pathogenic effects through enhanced production of cytokines (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, GM-CSF), chemokines (IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL20, MCP-1), metalloproteinases and other inflammatory molecules 83 . These proinflammatory mediators promote inflammation, immune cell infiltration and tissue damage. Additionally, IL-17-induced IL-6 maintains the TH17-T cell population 83 . The IL-1\u03b2-responsive EM T cells expressing CCR6, CCR2 and possibly other chemokine receptors may be recruited to sites of inflammation where IL-1\u03b2 together with other proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-23 or antigen-mediated TCR activation may activate them to produce proinflammatory cytokines and cause tissue damage. Taken together, findings raise the interesting possibility that CCR6 + EM T cells and/or IL-17 producing cells likely plays an important role in mediating IL-1\u03b2-induced inflammatory response in humans. One probable antiinflammtory mechanism of IL-1 blockers may thus be via reduction of the proinflammatory TH17 response. Indeed, in RA patients, Anakinra therapy associated with clinical improvement decreased the frequency of TH17 cells and serum levels of IL-17 and IL-21 84 .",
