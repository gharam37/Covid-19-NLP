This makes the development of accurate predictive models imperative, not just for understanding the course of the pandemic but more importantly for gaining insight into the efficacy of public health measures and planning accordingly. Epidemiological models are forced to make assumptions about many unknowns and therefore can be unreliable. Here, taking an empirical approach, we report a 20-30 day lag between the peak of confirmed to recovered cases and the peak of daily deaths in each country, independent of the epoch of that country in its pandemic cycle. This analysis is expected to be largely independent of the proportion of the population being tested and therefore should aid in planning around the timing and easing of public health measures. Our data also suggests broad predictions for the number of fatalities, generally somewhat lower than most other models. Finally, our model suggests that the world as a whole is shortly to enter a recovery phase, at least as far as the first pandemic wave is concerned.",

The development of models to understand and predict the course of COVID-19 is imperative, in order to gain insight into the efficacy of public health measures aimed at containing its spread. Current models are either epidemiological 1,2 or based on reported infection data 3 . These both have limitations: epidemiological models are forced to make assumptions about many unknowns thus varying wildly in their predictions, whilst reported data are retrospective and thus not predictive. It would be advantageous to have models that are directly data-driven and thus not forced to make assumptions, while retaining the predictive aspect of epidemiological models.",

The second wave, now a global one, appears to be peaking approximately at the time of writing (mid-April, 2020) while there concomitantly appears to be a reduction in the number of deaths per day globally. If sustained, this early relative recovery, together with the earlier peak, would indicate a final global number of COVID-19 fatalities in the order of 250,000.",
