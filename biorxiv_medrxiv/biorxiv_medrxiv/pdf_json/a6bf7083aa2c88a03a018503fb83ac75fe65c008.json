Here, we present a large-scale snATAC-seq dataset 60 (90,980 nuclei) of the human lung, generated in parallel with snRNA-seq (46,500 nuclei), 61 from healthy donors of ~30 weeks, ~3 years and ~30 years of age. Focusing on genes 62 implicated in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, we observed an increase in the proportion of 63 alveolar epithelial cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in adult compared to young 64 lungs. Consistent with expression dynamics, 10 chromatin peaks linked to TMPRSS2 65 exhibited significantly increased activity with age and harbored IRF and STAT binding 66 sites. Furthermore, we identified 14 common sequence variants in age-increasing peaks 67 with predicted regulatory function, including several associated with respiratory traits and 68 TMPRSS2 expression. Our findings reveal a plausible contributor to why children are 69 more resistant to COVID-19 and provide an epigenomic basis for transferring this 70 resistance to older populations. 71 72 73 74",

Therefore COVID-19 preferentially impacts fully mature lungs relative to 153 developing lungs. Widespread speculation has attempted to explain these age-154 associated differences, including immune senescence in the aging population.

In our data generated from normal lungs 228 this correlation was modest, suggesting there is low baseline co-expression of ACE2 and 229 IFNGR1. Among genes with increased expression in TMPRSS2 + versus TMPRSS2 -AT2 230 cells was ICAM1 (log2 (fold change)=0.27, -log10(FDR corrected p)=12.2, Supplementary 231 Table 3 ), which encodes a receptor for Rhinovirus (Zhou et al., 2017) . The potential co-232 expression of TMPRSS2 and ICAM1 may contribute to the often-observed co-infection 233 by more than one respiratory virus. Indeed, co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses 234 including Rhinovirus has been observed, promoting urgent calls to halt the clinical 235 The leading cause of death for COVID-19 is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome 251 (ARDS) which is characterized by failure of gas-exchange due to destruction of the 252 alveolar region of the lung (Du et al., 2020) . AT2 is an abundant epithelial cell type in the 253 alveolar region and expresses all of the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry genes assayed here and 254 likely bears the brunt of infection. Consequently, we focused on AT2 cells for follow up 255 analysis. We found that the percentage of AT2 cells expressing ACE2 had an increasing 256 trend in 30yo adult samples compared to 3yo samples ( Figure 1D ). In addition, we found 257 a strong trend of increase in the percentage of AT2 cells expressing TMPRSS2 in adult 258 samples compared to 3yo samples (41.2 \u00b1 6.6% for 3yo and 57.4 \u00b1 7.7% for 30yo, p = 259 0.05 (t-test), Figure 1E ).

To analyze changes in percentage of 747 nuclei expressing we performed One-way ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) with post-hoc 748 Tukey HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.0 for 749 Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA, www.graphpad.com. Due to 750 one potential outlier in the 30wkGA group (D062) we performed in addition a simple t-test 751 comparing 3 yr to 30 yr groups. Differential gene expression analysis between ACE2 + 752 and ACE2 -AT2 cells we used FindAllMarkers with parameters logfc = 0, min.pct = 0, 753 test.use = \"wilcox\", verbose = TRUE. 754 755 Normalization and comparison of gene expression frequency across snRNA-seq 756 and scRNA-seq datasets 757 Single cell RNA-seq (10x Genomics 3' v2) of 4 aged (>55yr) control lungs were 758 obtained from publicly available data (Morse et al., 2019; Reyfman et al., 2019). Raw 759 gene expression matrices were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 760 repository (GSE128033 and GSE122960). Cells were filtered using the following 761 commonly used criteria: >500 expressed genes and <10% UMIs mapped to mitochondrial 762 DNAs. In addition, cells with greater than or equal to 40,000 UMIs were excluded from 763 the downstream analysis; this filtration criterion was selected based on the distribution of 764 UMIs in single cells in individual donors. Seurat (version 3) (Stuart et al., 2019) was used 765 to identify AT2 cells from individual aged donors. Nuclei from the 9 libraries generated in 766 this study and cells from libraries for the 4 aged donors were integrated using the Seurat 767 3 standard integration pipeline (Stuart et al., 2019). ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression frequency in AT2 cells (percentage 769 of AT2 cells with >0 UMI) in individual donors. We then performed median based 770 normalization, so all donors reached the same median value. In calculating the median 771 value for each donor, the expression frequency values of genes (n=26,260) common in 772 both datasets were used. 773 774 Single nucleus ATAC-seq analysis 775 For each sequenced snATAC-Seq libraries, we obtained four FASTQ files paired-end 776 DNA reads as well as the combinatorial indexes for i5 (768 different PCR indices) and T7 777 (96 different tagmentation indices; Supplementary Table 8). We selected all reads with 778 <= 2 mistakes per individual index (Hamming distance between each pair of indices is 4) 779 and subsequently integrated the full barcode at the beginning of the read name in the 780 FASTQ files (https://gitlab.com/Grouumf/ATACdemultiplex/). Next, we used trim galore 781 (v.0.4.4) to remove adapter sequences from reads prior to read alignment. We aligned 782 reads to the hg19 reference genome using bwa mem (v.0.7.17) (Li and Durbin, 2009) and 783 subsequently used samtools (Li et al., 2009) to remove unmapped, low map quality 784 (MAPQ<30), secondary, and mitochondrial reads. We then removed duplicate reads on 785 a per-cell basis using MarkDuplicates (BARCODE_TAG) from the picard toolkit. As an 786 initial quality cutoff, we set a minimum of 1,000 reads (unique, non-mitochondrial) and 787 observed 120,090 cells passing this threshold. 788 We used a previously described pipeline to identify snATAC-seq clusters (Chiou et 789 al., 2019). Briefly, we used scanpy (Wolf et al., 2018) to uniform read depth-normalize 790 and log-transform read counts within 5 kb windows. We then identified highly variable (hv) 791 windows (min_mean=0.01, min_disp=0.25) and regressed out the total read depth across 792 hv windows (usable counts) within each experiment. We then merged cells across 793 experiments and extracted the top 50 PCs, using Harmony (Korsunsky et al., 2019) to 794 correct for potential confounding factors including donor-of-origin and biological sex. We 795 used Harmony-corrected components to build a nearest neighbor graph 796 (n_neighbors=30) using the cosine metric, which was used for UMAP visualization 797 (min_dist=0.3) and Leiden clustering (resolution=1.5) (Traag et al., 2019).",

First, we extracted the sequences underlying AT2 sites that 897 were promoter-distal (>\u00b1500 bp from GENCODE v19 transcript TSS for protein-coding 898 and long non-coding RNA genes). As described previously(Chiou et  al., 2019), we trained 899 an AT2 sequence-based model and used it to predict effects for all possible combinations 900 of 11mers. Next, to compile a comprehensive set of variants to test, we downloaded lists 901 of variants from gnomAD v3 (Karczewski et al., 2019) and filtered out variants that were 902 singletons or indels longer than 3 bp. We then used the liftOver (Tyner et al., 2017) utility 903 to transform GRCh38 into GRCh37/hg19 coordinates. We retained variants from either 904 dataset that mapped within TMPRSS2 linked sites and extracted sequences in a 19 bp 905 window around each variant (\u00b19 bp flanking each side). Finally, we calculated deltaSVM 906 z-scores for each variant by predicting deltaSVM scores, randomly permuting 11mer 907 effects and re-predicting deltaSVM scores, and using the parameters of the null 908 distribution to calculate deltaSVM z-scores. From the z-scores, we calculated p-values 909 and q-values and defined variants with significant effects using a threshold of FDR<0.1. 910 We identified common variants defined as minor allele frequency >.01 in at least one 911 major population group. For each common variant, we obtained sequence surrounding 912 each variant allele and predicted sequence motifs from the JASPAR database (Fornes et 913 al., 2020) using FIMO (Grant et al., 2011), and focused on motifs of TF families enriched 914 in age-dependent AT2 chromatin. 915 916 Phenotype associations for predicted effect variants 917",
