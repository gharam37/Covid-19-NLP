Recognizing viral PTMs is very important for better understanding the mechanism of viral infections and finding potential drug targets. However, a database of comprehensive PTM information on viruses is not available. Results: To fill this gap, we developed a viral post-translational modification database (VPTMdb) for collecting systematic information of viral PTM data. The VPTMdb contains 912 PTM sites that integrate 414 experimental-confirmed PTM sites with 98 proteins in 45 human viruses manually extracted from 162 publications and 498 PTMs extracted from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Moreover, we created a novel sequence-based classifier named VPTMpre to help users predict viral protein phosphorylated sites. Finally, an online web server was implemented for users to download viral PTM data and predict phosphorylated sites of interest.

            "text": "Post-translational modifications (PTMs) play a critical role in current proteomics research and regulate protein functions by altering protein interactions, stability, activity, and subcellular localization. Posttranslation modifications of viral proteins are relevant throughout various stages of the pathogen life cycle, especially viral infections and genome replication. For example, during entry, the influenza virus carries unanchored ubiquitin chains to engage the host cell's aggresome system (Banerjee, et al., 2014) . Once inside the host cell, viral PTMs regulating infecting process of HSV-1 encode ICP0 protein to degrade host proteins via ubiquitination and sumoylation (Randow and Lehner, 2009 ). In the viral life circle, the HIV-1 Tat protein ser-16 phosphorylated site regulates HIV-1 transcription (Ivanov, et al., 2018) . Therefore, knowledge of viral PTMs is of great significant to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying viral infections and recognizing potential drug targets. In recent years, several studies have identified multiple viral PTMs (Kulej, et al., 2017; Scaturro, et al., 2018; Zheng, et al., 2018) ; thus, establishing a database to provide relevant knowledge is important.",

First, we compared several feature extraction methods using support vector machine via a 5-fold cross-validation method to obtain the best feature representative strategy. Second, for feature selection, we separately input the features extracted from the previous step into three machine learning predictors (support vector machine, random forest and na\u00efve Bayes). Using the minimum redundancy and maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm (Hanchuan, et al., 2005) , the predictive performance of these three classifiers on different feature dimensions was compared. Subsequently, the features that performed well in all three classifiers were selected as the most meaningful and significant features and 68-dimensional features were obtained.

Now, it is important to answer two questions: (i) what is the difference between phosphorylated sites and non-phosphorylated sites and (ii) which features contribute most to the viral phosphorylation protein? To this end, we analysed the z-scale feature information between phosphorylated sites and non-phosphorylated sites. Then, we selected the most important features from the combined features with the mRMR method and using svm, random forest and na\u00efve Bayes to perform a predictive evaluation. ",

Overall, the different z-scale compositions surrounding the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated sites indicates that it is reasonable to choose the z-scale as a feature for prediction. ",

Figure 3A shows that the maximum AUCs of the svm and random forest are similar. For the random forest and svm, the AUCs increased when more features were selected (random forest: 14-135 features, with AUC > 0.90; svm: 27-135 features, with AUC > 0.90). However, we observed that the AUCs of na\u00efve Bayes (AUCs > 0.80) decreased when more features were added. From a statistical point of view, to prevent the curse of dimensionality, fewer and more meaningful features should be chosen. Taking the above results into consideration, for 68 features, the AUCs of the three predictors perform better, suggesting that 68D is the most meaningful feature among all the features.",

VPTMpre was integrated into the VPTMdb web server to provide an online phosphorylation site prediction service. Users can choose three classifiers (svm, random forest and na\u00efve Bayes) to predict phosphorylated sites of interests. However, because of data limitations, the prediction of VPTMpre is limited to serine sites. With continuous collection of new viral PTM data, we expect that VPTMpre will be extended to predict more types of PTM sites and obtain a better performance.",
