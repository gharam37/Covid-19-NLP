[1] Guidelines from the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control suggest that individuals aged 70 years and older or with an underlying medical condition such as cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, cancer, chronic obstructive compulsory disease (COPD), asthma, and diabetes, are considered to be at high risk of developing severe disease, and hence may require critical care. [1, 2] These recommendations are mainly based on studies from the Wuhan region of China and Italy, and generally show that once infected, individuals with at least one of these prognostic factors are more likely to go on to generate severe disease and a resulting higher risk of mortality. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Governments around the world have, therefore, recommended that individuals with at least one of these factors self-isolate for prolonged periods of time to not only reduce the risk contracting severe COVID-19, but also prevent any sudden increase in demand for critical care in hospitals, which could overwhelm health systems. If the pandemic developed to affect a large proportion of the population, then critical care capacity could become saturated. However, the prevalence of these prognostic factors for severe disease are to a large extent unknown in many countries. Knowledge of the distribution of individuals considered to be at high risk of severe COVID-19 disease, coupled with the capacity of the health care system, would allow clear strategic planning.",

[9] [10] [11] [12] Many of these models are based on the assumption that disease severity increases with age, but they do not account for an increased risk of severe disease in individuals with underlying medical conditions. This is usually because age stratified burden of disease at a local level is rarely available. Even when this information is available, data from which it originates can be obtained from a sample of the population rather than from the whole population. If the sample is not representative of the population at large, results may be biased. In order to build clear robust models that will provide trustworthy estimates of the extent to which the infection will impact populations, we need reliable estimates on the underlying prevalence of medical conditions suggesting high risk of severe disease.",

No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study population. The mean age was 41 years and around 50% of the 9.6 million individuals lived in three of the 21 counties (Stockholm, V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland and Sk\u00e5ne). Over 22% had at least one prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 (2,131,319 individuals), and 1.6% had at least three factors (154,746 individuals). Table 2 shows the burden and prevalence of each medical condition by age group in the study population. The prevalence of each condition generally increased as age increased; however, there was a higher prevalence of severe asthma in the youngest groups compared with all other age groups. Table 3 shows the burden and prevalence of each of the six prognostic factors in each Swedish county, and Figure 1 visualizes the ratio of the county specific prevalence of each factor to the prevalence of that factor overall in the study population. The burden and prevalence of all prognostic factors were as follows (Table 3) : the proportion of people aged 70 years and older ranged from 11.1% in Stockholm (242,208 individuals) to 17.6% in Kalmar (40,872 individuals); cardiovascular disease ranged from 6.4% in Uppsala and Stockholm (22,086 and 140,165 individuals) to 8.8% in Dalarna (24,205 individuals); cancer ranged from 1.1% in Norrbotten (2,790 individuals) to 1.6% in Halland (5,067 individuals); COPD ranged from 0.6% in V\u00e4sterbotten (1,708 individuals) to 1.1% in Kalmar (2,448 individuals); severe asthma ranged from 1.8% in V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland and \u00d6rebro (29,353 and 5,243 individuals) to 2.6% in Norrbotten and Stockholm (6,407 and 56,251 individuals); and diabetes ranged from 4.0% in Stockholm (86,195) to 4.7% in Uppsala (16, 311) . The burden of each of the five underlying medical conditions stratified by age group in each county are also presented in Appendix 1. Table 4 shows the burden and prevalence of individuals with at least one, two, and three of the six prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 in each county in Sweden, and Figure 2 visualizes the ratio of the county specific prevalence of people living with at least one, two, and three factors compared with the overall prevalence in the study population. The burden and prevalence of prognostic factors were: at least one prognostic factor ranged from 19.2% in Stockholm (416,988 individuals) to 25.9% in Kalmar (60,005 individuals); at least two prognostic factors ranged from 5.5% in Stockholm (119,057 individuals) to 8.5% in Kalmar (19, 699 individuals; and at least three prognostic factors ranged from 1.3% in Stockholm (28,162 individuals) to 2.1% in Kalmar (4,839 individuals).",

More than 150,000 individuals (1.6%) have at least three of these prognostic factors, which identifies the most vulnerable population. We also show that the distribution of the prognostic factors is heterogeneous across Sweden, with the Kalmar county containing the highest proportion of its inhabitants with at least one factor (25.5%).

[18] However, previous studies suggest the specificity and sensitivity of diagnoses of specific cardiovascular diagnoses such as acute myocardial infarction, heart failure and atrial fibrillation from the National Patient Registers are high. [19] The National Cancer Register reported that there were 214,000 individual tumors reported in 3 years prior to 31 st December 2016, while we report 129, 155 individuals in our study population with at least one tumor in 3 years prior to 1 st January 2016. [20] The prevalence of COPD is estimated at around 4-10% in Sweden, which is higher than the 0.8% we calculated. However, only 30% of COPD cases are diagnosed by healthcare professionals, which are often the most severe cases. The low observed prevalence of COPD in our study may therefore be due to us only capturing severe disease that is recorded in the Patient Register, and we were unable to capture moderate and mild COPD diagnosed and treated exclusively in primary care. [21] [22] [23] We have also underestimated the prevalence of asthma in Sweden, which is known to be between 8-10%, as we were only able to identify severe cases that required hospital admission. [19, 24, 25] However, more severe asthma is likely to exacerbate more severe COVID-19 disease, meaning we have identified those at the greatest risk. Finally, a study calculated a diabetes prevalence of 4.6% in Stockholm using survey data from the Stockholm Public Health Cohort, which is slightly higher than our estimate of 4.0%. [26] However, a report from the National Diabetes Register suggests that 22.6% of diabetes cases do not require pharmaceutical therapies, and only can be identified from primary care or quality registers, for which we did not have access.

Given hypertension and high blood pressure are precursors of clinical cardiovascular disease, it is likely that those with the most severe disease are captured in our cardiovascular disease estimates. Furthermore, other health agencies around the world (Center for Disease Control, United States; National Health Service, United Kingdom) have suggested additional prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 disease such as chronic kidney disease, liver disease, immunosuppression, and severe obesity.

We believe that this is a fair assumption and gives an accurate overview of the burden of disease in the population for all diseases apart from cancer. It has been suggested that only those with active cancer are truly at a high risk of severe COVID-19, and a definition of active cancer can take many forms. [32] Three years can be considered a long time after cancer diagnosis, and if the individual has survived, it is likely they will be considered to no longer have active cancer at three years after diagnosis.

However, these numbers will allow authorities to optimally plan healthcare resources, by comparing the number of individuals at risk of severe disease with the critical care capacity. These results can also be applied to underlying assumptions of disease burden in modelling efforts to support COVID-19 planning. Overall, this information is crucial when deciding appropriate strategies to mitigate the pandemic and reduce both the direct mortality burden from the disease itself, and the indirect mortality burden from potentially overwhelmed health systems.",
