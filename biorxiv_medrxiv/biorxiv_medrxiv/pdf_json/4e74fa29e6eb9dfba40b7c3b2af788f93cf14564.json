            "text": "organisms showed that synonymous codons are not used uniformly within and between genes of one genome. This phenomenon called synonymous codon usage bias (SCUB) or codon usage bias (CUB) [11] [12] [13] [14] . Further, the degree of the unequal use of synonymous codons differs between species [15, 16] . Hence, each organism has its optimal codons, where an optimal codon is defined as a codon which is more frequently used in highly expressed genes than in the slightly expressed genes [17] . Two main factors shape the codon usage of an organism mutation and selection [18] [19] [20] . Other factors also known to influence the CUB of an organism are nucleotide composition [21] , synonymous substitution rate [22] , tRNA abundance [23] , codon hydropathy and DNA replication initiation sites [24] , gene length [25] , and expression level [26] . Since viruses rely on the tRNA pool of their hosts in the translation process, previous studies suggest that translational selection and/or directional mutational pressure act on the codon usage of the viral genome to optimize or deoptimize it towards the codon usage of their hosts [27, 28] . Hence, it is important to examine viral gene structures and compositions at the codon or nucleotide level to reveal the mechanisms of virus-host relationships and virus evolution [29] .",

Our results showed that, CAI values ( Table 1 ) ranged from 0.53 (Pakistan isolate) to 0.54 (Taiwan isolate). As well as, some genes showed a higher CAI with an average of 0.62 (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene) and ORF7a protein gene displayed a CAI value of 0.58. The CAI results for SARS-CoV-2 isolates revealed a moderate host-virus co-adaptation, also the CDS for the SARS-CoV-2 can utilize the human cell resources for its translation process efficiently. Moreover, the highest CAI value was recorded for nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene (0.62) which plays a fundamental role during viral self-assembly [63] . The second highest gene with CAI 0.58 was ORF7a, which may play a role in viral assembly or budding events unique to SARS-CoV [64] . The CAI results for both genes reflect their importance (viral assembly and budding events) for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to complete its life-cycle efficiently in the host cell. Only small amounts of the Envelope (E) protein is sufficient to trigger the formation of virus-like particles [63] , which may explain its lowest CAI value (0.48) among other genes.",

To examine the effect of dinucleotides (in second and third codon positions only) bias over the CUB of SARS-CoV-2 CDS, a new index named SDU was used to account for dinucleotide frequencies. According to SDU results, CpU was the most over-represented dinucleotide which may indicate that SARS-CoV-2 prefer A/U-ended codons. The underrepresentation of UpA and CpG in SARS-CoV-2 CDS could be due to the effect of these dinucleotides on the replication rate, where increasing UpA and CpG levels in RNA viruses",

Synonymous codons with RSCU values \u2265 1.6 were considered over-represented or preferred codons, RSCU values that fell between 1 and 1.6 were considered randomly used or unbiased, and RSCU values \u2264 0.6 were considered under-represented. Among the 18 amino acids used in the analysis, we found 8 over-represented codons for the following amino acids (Arg, Val, Ser, Ala, Thr, Pro, Leu, and Gly) that are common in all13 isolates with their corresponding average RSCU values (2.46, 2.05, 1.995, 1.815, 1.724, 1.713, 1.687, 1.651, respectively). The amino acid Arginine (Arg) over biased with AGA codon, Valine (Val)over biased with GUU, Serine over biased with UCU, Alanine (Ala) over biased with GCU, Threonine (Thr) over biased with ACU, Proline (Pro) over biased with CCU, Leucine (Leu) over biased with CUU, Glycine (Gly) over biased with GGU. The cluster (Heat map) analysis revealed this pattern as all of the previously mentioned putative preferred codons clustered togetherFig. 3. It is quite interesting to note that all 8 over-represented codons are A/Uended (U-ended: 7, A-ended: 1), and none of them was G/C-ended. Meanwhile, most of the under-represented codons are G/C-ended. Furthermore, 4 out of the 8 over-represented codons (RSCU > 1.6) ended with CpU dinucleotide, which was mentioned before as the most over-representative dinucleotide. Thus, it is evident from nucleotide compositional and RSCU analyses that SARS-CoV-2 genomes exhibited higher codon usage bias towards A/Uended codons compared to G/C ended ones.Hierarchical clustering (Heat map) and phylogenetic analysesTo observe similar patterns of codon usage bias among the 13 SARS-CoV-2 isolates we performed a hierarchical cluster analysis based on the RSCU values obtained from all coding regions in their genomes. Codons with similar RSCU values were clustered together, more noticeably the 8 over-represented or preferred codons with RSCU values >1.6 (AGA, GUU, UCU, GCU, ACU, CCU, CUU, and GGU) on the right side ofFig. 3. The clustering of the 13 isolates on the top side ofFig. 3 yielded two major branches (A, and B). The isolate from Pakistan separated itself in branch A from the other 12 isolates in branch B indicating its usage pattern. Branch B can be further divided into 3 sub-branches: two of them contained South Korea, and the USA being closer to Pakistan isolate than the remaining ones. Meanwhile, the third sub-branch contained two main clusters that are fairly closer to the USA than South Korea. Isolates from India and Spain are grouped in one cluster. The other cluster contained two sub-clusters in which isolates from Australia, Sweden, Brazil and Italy are grouped in one sub-cluster away from China, Nepal, Taiwan and Vietnam isolate in the other sub-cluster. To gain more insight into the evolutionary relationships between the 13 SARS-CoV-2 isolates, phylogenetic analysis was performed based on their whole genome sequences(Fig. 4). It yielded two main branches: one contained the outgroup (Human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012) separated from other SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The branch containing SARS-CoV-2 isolates can be divided into 3 sub-branches: two of them contained the USA, and Pakistan isolates closer to each other than other SARS-CoV-2 isolates, however, the third sub-branch contained two main clusters that are fairly closer to Pakistan isolate than the USA. One cluster containing isolates from Nepal, Taiwan, China, Vietnam, India, and Spain can be further divided into two sub-clusters, where isolates from India and Spain are grouped in one sub-cluster away from others. The other main cluster containing isolates from South Korea, Brazil, Italy, Sweden, and Australia can be also further divided into two sub-clusters, where isolates from Sweden and Australia are grouped in a sub-cluster away from the others.Despite the differences between hierarchical clustering and phylogenetic analyses, they exhibited similarities that can be summarized in the following 4 points. (i). Both Pakistan and the USA isolates showed clear relatedness in both dendrograms that separated them away from other SARS-CoV-2 isolates. However, Pakistan isolate is further than the USA from the remaining isolates from codon usage bias perspective indicating its unique codon usage bias.That wasn't the case in the phylogenetic tree as Pakistan showed more relatedness to other isolates than the USA from an evolutionary perspective based on their whole-genome sequence similarities. (ii). Isolates from India and Spain grouped themselves in a sub-cluster in the phylogenetic tree and were also present in the same sub-cluster in RSCU clustering analysis indicating their highly similar patterns of codon usage bias and evolutionary relatedness. (iii). Isolates from Sweden, Australia, Brazil, and Italy fell into the same cluster in both analyses where Sweden and Australia being the closest to each other. (iv). Isolates from Nepal, Taiwan, China, and Vietnam also fell into the same cluster in both analyses. The hierarchical clustering and phylogenetic analyses clearly showed that, despite the",

Also, many other studies on different RNA viruses for different hosts show ENc values in the same range, as in H1N1pdm IAV (ENc = 52.5) [30], Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (ENc = 43.61) [58], Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (ENc = 50.91) [59], and Classical Swine Fever Virus (ENc = 51.7) [60]. The 13 SARS-CoV-2 tested isolates showed the same pattern of ENc values with mean 48.54 and SD = 0.5, for each isolates the average ENc values ranged from 46.64 to 48.56. Together this indicates a relatively stable and conserved genomic composition in these 13 isolates, with slightly low ENc values (high CUB) compared to RNA viruses reported in other studies",
