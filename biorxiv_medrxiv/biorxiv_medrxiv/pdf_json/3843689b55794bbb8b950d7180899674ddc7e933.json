Data presented in CT were transformed to log10 copies/mL using a published 80 relationship in Zou et al. [4] and the model was fit to the log10 viral load.

We also 101 performed a sensitivity analysis assuming c= 5 and 20 d -1 and found that the estimate of 102 \u03b4 remained unchanged and the estimate of R 0 varied from 12.4 to 15.5. 103Model building strategy 104Because not all parameters can be identified when only viral load data are available, 105 the model was successively fitted with different values of k={1, 3 ,5}d -1 and V 0 ={10 -3 , 10 -2 , 106 10 -1 } copies/mL [6]. Parameters were estimated in a non-linear mixed-effect modeling 107 framework using the SAEM algorithm implemented in Monolix (www.lixoft.com). The 108 model providing the best description of the data was used for the predictions and the 109 individual data fitting, and model averaging was used to correct for the model uncertainty 110 when calculating confidence intervals of estimated parameters[9]. 111Predicting the effects of treatment according to the antiviral efficacy and the timing 112 treatment of initiation 113We assumed that antivirals with a constant effectiveness \u03b5 could reduce R 0 by a factor 114 (1-\u03b5), with \u03b5 taking values from 50% to 99% in Equation 2. We considered different timing of 115 treatment initiation, from the time of infection to 3 days after the symptom onset. For each 116 treatment strategy, we calculated the reduction in viral load at the peak of infection in the 117 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

For lopinavir, EC 50 Vero E6 cells were infected by SARS-CoV-2 (strain 126 BetaCoV/France/IDF0571/2020) at a MOI of 0.01 and treated with several concentrations of 127 lopinavir one hour after infection. Supernatant samples were collected at 48 and 72 hour post 128 infection. Relative quantification of viral genome was performed by RT-qPCR from RNA 129 extracted using QIAamp viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). IC50 values of lopinavir (48 and 72 hours post infection, respectively) were calculated from dose-131 response curve using a four-parameter logistic regression model. CC50 were determined 132 using a MTS viability assay in Vero E6 cells treated by a large range of lopinavir 133 concentrations. No published results on remdesivir pharmacokinetics was available at the time 134 of this publication. We then simulated 100 PK profiles according to the estimated distribution 135 and we calculated for each simulated individual the mean inhibitory coefficient during the 136 first week of treatment, to anticipate their effect on peak viral load.
