We describe here 46 potent inhibitory effects on content release and infection by chimeric VSV 47 containing the envelope proteins of EBOV (VSV-EBOV) or SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-48 SARS-CoV-2) elicited by Apilimod and Vacuolin-1, small molecule inhibitors of 49 the main endosomal Phosphatidylinositol-3-Phosphate/Phosphatidylinositol 5-50 Kinase, PIKfyve. We also describe potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 strain 2019-51 nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 by Apilimod.

Binding of virus to specific host cell receptor(s) triggers 59 membrane fusion, which can occur directly at the plasma membrane or following 60 endocytic uptake. Viruses that require endocytic uptake can use different initial 61 trafficking routes to reach the site of membrane fusion. In endosomes, acidic pH serves 62 to triggers conformational rearrangements in the viral envelope proteins that catalyze 63 membrane fusion, as seen for influenza A virus (IAV) and vesicular stomatitis virus 64 (VSV). For Ebola virus (EBOV), proteolytic processing of the envelope protein by host 65 cell proteases (Chandran et al., 2005) is necessary to expose the receptor binding 66 domain prior to engagement of Neiman Pick C1 (NPC1 or NPC Intracellular Cholesterol 67 Transporter 1) -the late endosomal-lysosomal receptor protein (Carette et al., 2011) . 68 Proteolytic processing is also required for severe acute respiratory syndrome A hallmark of the endolysosomal system is controlled dynamic trafficking of vesicular 80 carriers among its various sub-compartments. Phophoinositides are markers for 81 defining the identity of these sub-compartments because they are restricted in their 82 distribution to specific intracellular membranes [reviewed in (Carlton and Cullen, 2005) ]. 83 Although it is one of the least abundant of the phosphoinositides in cells, PI(3,5)P2 is 84 particularly important for endomembrane homeostasis. It is produced by PIKfyve, which 85 phosphorylates the D-5 position in phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) to yield 86 phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) . First cloned as 87 mammalian p235 , PIKfyve is a 240 kDa class III lipid kinase, 88 present on the cytosolic face of endosomal membranes (Ikonomov et al., 2001; 89 Ablation of PIKfyve function by genetic (Ikonomov et al., 2001; 2002) or 93 pharmacological means (Cai et The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.21.053058 doi: bioRxiv preprint (Fig. 1C) .

These inhibitors include Apilimod (Ikonomov et al., 2011), Vacuolin-1 (Cai et 102 al., 2013), a series of 30 Vacuolin-related molecules (Cerny et al., 2004; Sano et al., 103 2016), YM201636 (Jefferies et al., 2008), and WX8 chemical family members (Sharma 104 et al., 2019). Physiological effects of these compound in cells include inhibition of 105 autophagy (Chen et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2014; Sano et al., 2016), reduced generation of 106 IL-12/IL-23, and reduced dendritic cell infiltration in psoriasis (Wada et al., 2012). 107 108 Apilimod also inhibits infection by several viruses, including ZEBOV. Although it does 109 not alter the pH of endosomes nor inhibit cathepsin B or L (Nelson et al., 2017), 110 Apilimod blocks entry of ZEBOV and other pathogenic filoviruses (Qiu et al., 2018). 111 Several groups reported that Apilimod prevents colocalization of VSV-ZEBOV 112 pseudoviruses with the EBOV endosomal receptor NPC1, but does not prevent 113 colocalization with early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) (Ou et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2018; 114 Spence et al., 2016). Apilimod also inhibits entry of pseudotyped viruses bearing the 115 spike proteins of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, as well as of authentic 116 mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) particles (Ou et al., 2020). 117 118 Here, we have studied the effects of Apilimod on infection of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 119 and VSV-eGFP-ZEBOV chimeras and showed that Apilimod blocks infection of both, 120 with an IC50 of ~50 nM. Apilimod and Vacuolin-1 also prevented entry and infection of 121 VSV-MeGFP-ZEBOV and many of the internalized VSV-MeGFP-ZEBOV virions 122 colocalized with NCP1 in the distended, vacuolated endosomes. This suggests that 123 blocking PIKfyve kinase has the same downstream effects on these viruses, even 124 though VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 does not require interaction with NPC1",

Following the incubation protocol summarized 141 in Fig 1A, we tested the effects on infection of Apilimod or Vacuolin-1; both compounds 142 are small-molecule inhibitors of PIKfyve kinase, which generates PI(5)P and PI(3,5)P2 143 in late endosomes and lysosomes. Using a flow cytometry based-assay to monitor a 144 single round of infection determined by expression of viral MeGFP(Fig. 1B), we found 145 that Apilimod and Vacuolin-1 potently inhibit VSV-MeGFP-ZEBOV infection(Fig. 1C).146 These results agree with results obtained by others with Apilimod (Hulseberg et al., 147 2019; Nelson et al., 2017), in different cell types infected with MLV virus pseudotyped 148 with EBOV G or with Ebola virus itself (Dyall et al., 2018; Nelson et al., 2017; Qiu et al., 149 2018).

The representative examples of VSV 165 infection and RNP core release shown in Fig. 2B were obtained in the absence or 166 presence of cycloheximide, which prevents viral protein expression. In the absence of 167 cycloheximide (left panel), large amounts of newly synthesized MeGFP are present 168 throughout the cell. In the presence of cycloheximide (right panel), , Apilimod, Vacuolin-1 and IN1 prevented entry of VSV-Me-GFP-EBOV 174 but not of VSV-MeGFP or VSV-MeGFP-V296H. As expected, Bafilomycin A1blocked 175 entry of all viruses (images in Fig. 2C and quantification in Fig. 2D). 176 177 Intracellular trafficking of virus particles in the presence of Apilimod or Vacuolin-178 1. Internalized virus particles traffic along the endocytic pathway to reach the 179 endosomal compartment(s) from which membrane fusion and genome entry into the 180 cytosol occur. To establish the identity of the endosomal compartments, we used 181 genome-editing in SVG-A cells to replace expression of a subset of proteins enriched in 182 different endosomal compartments (the small GTPases Rab5c and Rab7a, EEA1, or 183 NPC1) with their corresponding fluorescent chimeras obtained by fusion with TagRFP, 184 mScarlet, or Halo (Fig. 3B, 3C, 3E, 3F, 4B-E). The lack of fluorescently tagged fillipin (a 185 cholesterol binder) in the endolysosomal compartment in the absence but not in the 186 presence of U18666A, a potent inhibitor of NPC1 (Fig 4F), showed that NPC1-cell spinning disk confocal microscopy, we monitored the presence of virus 190 particles in the fluorescently tagged endosomes by colocalization with the fluorescent 191 spots from the virus-incorporated MeGFP. We monitored entry by carrying out the 192 experiments in the presence of cycloheximide, thus ensuring that any MeGFP 193 fluorescent signal at the nuclear margin originated only from MeGFP molecules carried 194 by incoming viral particles (Fig. 3C). All cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C throughout all 195 phases of the experiment to ensure normal and undisturbed intracellular trafficking. All 196 control experiments performed in the absence of inhibitors showed arrival of VSV-197 MeGFP, VSV-MeGFP-V296H, or VSV-MeGFP-ZEBOV virus particles to early (Rab5c 198 and EEA1)(Fig. 3D, 4E)or late endosomes and lysosomes (Rab7a or NPC1)(Fig. 3G,199 4C, 4E). MeGFP released from all viruses appeared at the nuclear margin, showing 200 effective RNP release. NPC1, the receptor for VSV-MeGFP-ZEBOV entry is required for 201 fusion from endosomes (Carette et al., 2011). The successful VSV-MeGFP-ZEBOV 202 infection observed in the absence of drug in cells expressing NPC1-Halo alone or ., 2003; Rutherford et al., 2006). VSV-MeGFP and VSV-MeGFP-V296H 210 (fluorescent dots, white) reached all tagged species of enlarged endolysosomes and 211 successfully penetrated into the cytosol, as indicated by MeGFP at the nuclear margin 212(Fig. 3E, 3F and 4C, 4D). VSV-MeGFP-ZEBOV also trafficked to all tagged species of 213 enlarged endolysosomes, often reaching one of the numerous NPC1-containing 214 vacuoles enriched in EEA1(Fig. 5C). VSV-MeGFP-ZEBOV in EEA1-containing 215 endosomes increased in the presence of Apilimod, as also reported for VLP EBOV (Qiu 216 et al., 2018). While able to reach NPC1-containing functional endosomes in cells treated 217 with Apilimod, VSV-MeGFP-ZEBOV failed to penetrate into the cytoplasm, as reflected 218 by absence of MeGFP in the nuclear margin (Fig. 5B). 219 220 Apilimod blocks infection of VSV SARS-CoV-2. Using a recombinant vesicular 221 stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing soluble eGFP (VSV-eGFP) where the glycoprotein (G) 222 was replaced with that of ZEBOV G (VSV-eGFP-EBOV) or SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-eGFP-223 SARS-Cov-2). We inoculated MA104 cells with these chimera viruses and tested the 224 effects of Apilimod on infection by flow cytometry(Fig. 6A). We found potent inhibition 225 of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 infection by Apilimod and confirmed that the compound 226 also inhibits VSV-eGFP-ZEBOV infection(Fig. 6B, 6C). The dose-response curves 227 indicated similar effects for VSV-eGFP-ZEBOV and VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 (IC50s ~ 228 50 nM), in contrast to the absence of any detectable inhibition of VSV-eGFP infection",

            "text": "Pasqual et al., 2011). Coronavirus and filovirus surface glycoproteins share a 244 requirement for entry associated proteolytic processing for activation as fusogens 245 (Chandran et al., 2005) Filoviruses require passage through low pH compartments 246 where cathepsins are active,. Coronaviruses may enter directly by fusion at the plasma 247 membrane or following receptor mediated endocytosis. Cell entry of SARS-CoV and 248 SARS-CoV-2 depends on the protease TMPRSS2 in conjunction with ACE2 (Glowacka 249 et al., 2011; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Matsuyama et al., 2010; Shulla et al., 2011), and 250 when TMPRSS2 is present, the entry pathway becomes insensitive to cathepsin 251 inhibition (Glowacka et al., 2011; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Simmons et al., 2004). 252 253 The common inhibition of viruses from all three groups by Apilimod is a consequence of 254 perturbing their shared entry pathway. Moreover, it is not the cathepsin activity itself that 255 these compounds affect, judging from the outcome of the assays with Apilimod and 256 Vacuolin-1 showing they inhibit VSV chimeras bearing the surface glycoproteins of 257 ZEBOV and LCMV and to a lesser extent LASV. Apilimod also inhibits infection of cells 258 by VSV-SARS-CoV-2 as well as by authentic SARS-CoV-2; neither compound blocks 259 infection by wild-type VSV. For VSV-ZEBOV, we have shown that the virus reaches a 260 compartment enriched in NPC1, the EBOV co-receptor, and often also enriched in 261 EEA1, but that it nonetheless fails to release internal proteins into the cytosol. Apilimod 262 does not inhibit cathepsin (Nelson et al., 2017) but Apilimod (Baranov et al., 2019) and 263 Vacuolin-1 (Lu et al., 2014; Sano et al., 2016) can interfere with cathepsin maturation as 264 evidenced by an increase in pro-cathepsin in treated cells (Nelson et al., 2017); they 265 don't influence endosomal pH (Cerny et al., 2004; Nelson et al., 2012) although other 266 studies report Vacuolin-1 increases pH (Lu et al., 2014; Sano et al., 2016). Irrespective 267 of this discrepancy, both Apilimod and Vacuolin-1 inhibit PI-3P-5-kinase (PIKfyve) (Cai 268 et al., 2013; Sano et al., 2016), a three-subunit complex (Sbrissa et al., 2007) with a PI-269 3P-binding FYVE domain (Sbrissa et al., 1999; Shisheva et al., 1999) that recognizes 270 the endosomal marker, PI-3-P. Functional ablation of this enzyme by genetic means 271 (Ikonomov et al., 2001; 2002) gives rise to the same cellular phenotype as treatment 272 with either compound (Cai et al., 2013; Cerny et al., 2004; Sano et al., 2016). The 273 similar dose-response curves for Apilimod inhibition of the ZEBOV and SARS-CoV-2 274 chimeras (IC50 of ~ 50 nM) and of authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus (IC50 ~ 10 nM) endosomal membranes, is the swelling of endosomes into small, spherical 282 vacuoles -the phenomenon that gave Vacuolin-1 its name (Cerny et al., 2004). Our 283 imaging data with VSV-MeGFP-ZEBOV chimeras show that the virus particles 284 accumulating in these structures, many of which also contain the NPC1 co-receptor 285 (Carette et al., 2011; C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2011), often appear to be relatively immobile and 286 adjacent to the endosomal limiting membrane. One possible explanation is that when a 287 virion reaches these distended endosomes, it can bind or remain bound to the limiting 288 membrane, but not fuse. Another is that virions may fuse with smaller intraluminal 289 vesicles in the endosomal lumen (Le Blanc et al., 2005), but that PI-3,5-P2 depletion 290 prevents back fusion of these vesicles with the endosomal limiting membrane and 291 inhibits release into the cytosol of the viral genome. 292 293 Inhibition of infection by authentic SARS-CoV-2 shows that the blocked release of the 294 viral genome from a vacuolated endosome is independent of the shape, size, and 295 distribution of spike protein on the virion. The assay we used to determine effects on 296 infectivity of authentic virus measured release of virions after multiple rounds of 297 infection, rather than entry, which we monitored in the VSV-SARS-CoV-2 experiments 298 by detecting eGFP synthesis in the cytosol. Nevertheless, the IC50 of Apilimod in 299 experiments with authentic virus is remarkably similar (or even better) L inhibitors block SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell 303 culture (Ou et al., 2020; Simmons et al., 2005), they have less pronounced effects when 304 tested in animals. This may because another protease, TMPRSS2 on the surface of 305 cells in relevant tissues, appears to prime SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins for efficient entry 306 (Hoffmann et al., 2020). As the effectiveness of Apilimod and Vacuolin-1 does not 307 depend on cathepsin inhibition, their capacity to block entry of several distinct families of 308 viruses is likely to be independent of the identity of the protease that primes their 309 surface glycoprotein for fusion.

All viruses were generated and recovered according to (Whelan et al.and Prevention (gift of Natalie Thornburg). Virus was passaged once in 511 Vero CCL81 cells (ATCC) and titrated by focus-forming assay also on Vero E6 cells. Halo, or mScarlet were cloned into the pUC19 vector (donor constructs) which 525 then served as homologous recombination repair templates for the Cas9 enzyme-526 cleaved genomic DNA. Donor constructs were obtained by a ligation of PCR 527 amplification products from the genomic DNA fragments, TagRFP, Halo, and mScarlet 528 sequences. Primers F1-R1 and F3-R3 amplified approximately 800 base pairs of 529 genomic sequences upstream and downstream of the start codon of Rab5c, Rab7a or 530 EEA1, or the stop codon of NPC1, respectively. Primers F1 and R3 contain sequences 531 complementary to the pUC19 vector linearized using the SmaI restriction enzyme (lower 532 case in the primer sequences). The TagRFP sequence containing the GGS peptide 533 linker was amplified using primers F2-R2 from a TagRFP mammalian expression 534 plasmid used as a template. The F2 primer contains complementary sequences to the 535 3' end of the F1-R1 fragment, while the F3 primer contains complementary sequences 536 to the 3' end of the TagRFP sequences. PCR products (fragments F1-R1, F2-R2, and 537 F3-R3) were subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose and gel purified using a 538 purification kit from Zymogen. The PCR fragments were cloned into the linearized 539 pUC19 vector using the Gibson Assembly Cloning Kit (E5510S; New England Biolabs)cells) were co-transfected with 0.8 \u00b5g of Streptococcus 545 pyogenes Cas9, 0.8 \u00b5g free PCR product coding for the target sgRNA, and 0.8 \u00b5g 546 pUC19 vector using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the 547 manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were grown for 7 to 10 days and sorted 548 for TagRFP, Halo, or mScarlet expression using fluorescence-activated cell sorting 549 (FACS) (SH-800S; Sony). Prior to FACS, NPC1-Halo cells were labeled for 15 minutes 550 with Janelia Fluor TM 647 (JF647). Single cells expressing the desired chimera were 551 isolated, clonally expanded, and then screened by genomic PCR for TagRFP, drug or DMSO at 37\u00b0C for one hour. Following this, cells were incubated 560 for one hr at 37\u00b0C with VSV, VSV-MeGFP-V296H, VSV-MeGFP-RABV, VSV-MeGFP-561 LASV, VSV-MeGFP-LCVM or VSV-MeGFP-ZEBOV in drug or DMSO-containing 562 infection medium (\u03b1-MEM, 50mM HEPES, 2% FBS). Cells were then washed to remove 563 non-adsorbed viruses and further incubated at 37\u00b0C in medium containing the drug or 564 DMSO with experiments ending at the indicated times by fixation with 3.7% 565 formaldehyde in PBS. Fluorescent intensity from 20,000 single cells from a single round 566 of infection was determined by flow cytometry using a BD FACSCanto TM were pretreated for one h with the indicated concentration Apilimod or 570 DMSO. Pretreated cells were inoculated with VSV-eGFP, VSV-eGFP-EBOV or VSV-571 eGFP-SARS-Cov-2 at an MOI = 1 (based on titers in MA104 cells) in the presence of 572 Apilimod or DMSO for one hour at 37\u00b0C. Six to 8 hour post infection, cells were 573 collected and fixed in 2% PFA and then subjected to flow cytometry. The percentage of 574 GFP cells was determined using FlowJo software (Tree Star Industries, Ashland, OR). 575 576 Vero E6 cell monolayers were pretreated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with serial dilutions of Apilimod 577 at the indicated concentrations. Next, SARS-CoV-2 was diluted to an MOI of 0.01 focus-578 forming units (FFU)/cell in Apilimod-containing medium and added to Vero E6 cells for 1 579 h at 37\u00b0C. After adsorption, cells were washed once with PBS, and medium containing 580 the respective concentration of Apilimod was added. Cell were incubated for a 24 h at 581 37\u00b0C, and at which time cell culture supernatants were removed and used for 582 determination of viral titer by focus forming assay. 583 584 SARS-CoV-2 focus forming assay 585 Cell culture supernatants from virus-infected cells were diluted serially 10-fold and 586 added to Vero E6 cell monolayers in 96-well plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. 587 Subsequently, cells were overlaid with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose in MEM supplemented 588 with 2% FBS. Plates were harvested 30 h later by removing overlays and fixed with 4% 589 paraformaldehdye in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Plates were washed and 590 sequentially incubated with 1 \u00b5g/mL of CR3022 anti-spike antibody (Yuan et al., 2020) 591 and HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG in PBS supplemented with 0.A cells plated on glass #1.5 coverslips at about 30-40 % confluency one day prior 600 to experiment were treated with drug or DMSO for one hr at 37\u00b0C. Following this, cells 601 were incubated at 37\u00b0C with VSV, VSV-MeGFP-V296H, VSV-MeGFP-RABV, VSV-602 MeGFP-LASV, VSV-MeGFP-LCVM or VSV-EBOV (also expressing MeGFP) in drug or 603 DMSO containing infection medium. After this, cells were washed then further incubated 604 in medium containing the drug or DMSO at 37\u00b0C with the experiment ending at the 605 indicated time by fixation for 20 min at room temperature with 3.7% formaldehyde in 606 PBS. This was followed with a10-minute incubation of 5\u00b5g/mL of Alexa647-labeled 607 wheat germ agglutinin in PBS to label the outline of the cells. 608 609 Cells were imaged using a spinning disk confocal microscope with optical planes 610 spaced 0.3 \u00b5m apart (Cocucci et al., 2012). The entry assay scored the presence of 611 MeGFP at the nuclear margin in each cell. Trafficking of viruses to endosomal 612 compartments was observed using live-cell imaging using the spinning disc confocal 613 microscope. Time series with images taken every three seconds for two minutes in a 614 single optical plane with the appropriate fluorescent channels (Cocucci et al., 2012) 615 were acquired from non-fixed samples imaged at the end of the experimental period. 616 For experiments containing NPC1-Halo, the Halo-tagged cells were labeled with either 617 250 nM JF549 or JF647 dye in media for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Following labeling, cells 618 were washed three times with media. The microscope was operated using the 619 Slidebook 6.4 software package (3I) and images were displayed also using the means from cells with different treatments, one-way ANOVA and the 624 post-hoc Tukey test analysis were used to take into account unequal sample sizes Institutes of Health funding (AI059371) and unrestricted funds from WUSM 636 to S.P.W. and by (75N93019C00062 and R01 AI127828) to M.S.D. 637 638 AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS (NAMES GIVEN AS INITIALS) 639 T.K., S.P.W., and M.S.D. were responsible for the overall design of the study; Y.K. 640 carried out virus infection, entry and imaging experiments and prepared figures in the 641 lab of T.K.
