            "text": "Early warning signals (EWS) identify systems approaching a critical transition, where the system undergoes a sudden change in state. For example, monitoring changes in variance or autocorrelation offers a computationally inexpensive method which can be used in real-time to assess when an infectious disease transitions to elimination. EWS have a promising potential to not only be used to monitor infectious diseases, but also to inform control policies to aid disease elimination. Previously, potential EWS have been identified for prevalence data, however the prevalence of a disease is often not known directly. In this work we identify EWS for incidence data, the standard data type collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or World Health Organization (WHO). We show, through several examples, that EWS calculated on simulated incidence time series data exhibit vastly different behaviours to those previously studied on prevalence data. In particular, the variance displays a decreasing trend on the approach to disease elimination, contrary to that expected from critical slowing down theory; this could lead to unreliable indicators of elimination when calculated on real-world data. We derive analytical predictions which can be generalised for many epidemiological systems, and we support our theory with simulated studies of disease incidence. Additionally, we explore EWS calculated on the rate of incidence over time, a property which can be extracted directly from incidence data. We find that although incidence might not exhibit typical critical slowing down properties before a critical transition, the rate of incidence does, presenting a promising new data type for the application of statistical indicators.",

It is therefore critical to monitor infectious diseases as new data become available during control campaigns. One obstacle in observing disease emergence or elimination is understanding what influences noise in the data and how this fluctuates when near to zero cases. The standard data type collected is the number of new cases per day/month/year but mathematical modellers often focus on data such as the total number of infectious people, due to its analytical properties. We have developed a methodology to monitor the standard type of data to inform whether a disease is approaching emergence or disease elimination.

            "text": "One of the greatest challenges in society today is the burden of infectious diseases, 2 affecting public health and economic stability all over the world. Infectious diseases 3 disproportionately affect individuals in poverty, with millions of those suffering daily 4 from diseases that are considered eradicable. The potential for eradicating diseases such 5 as polio, guinea worm, measles, mumps or rubella is immense (International Task Force 6 for Disease Elimination, [31] ). Even where effective vaccines or treatments exist, disease it was later abandoned in 1969 due to funding shortages and drug resistance [26] , 10 leading to re-emergence of disease in Europe [27] . Assessing when a disease is close 11 enough to elimination to die out without further intervention, thus prompting the end 12 of a control campaign, is a problem of global economic importance. If campaigns are 13 stopped prematurely it can result in disease resurgence and subsequently put control 14 efforts back by decades. Conversely, the threat posed by newly emerging diseases such 15 as SARs, Ebola or the recent corona-virus outbreak COVID-2019 strains available 16 resources, places restrictions on global movement and disrupts the worlds most 17 vulnerable societies. Identifying which newly-emerging diseases will present a global 18 threat, and which will never cause a widespread epidemic is of critical importance. 19 To overcome the challenges identifying disease elimination or emergence, numerous 20 studies have suggested the use of early warning signals (EWS) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . EWS are statistics 21 that may be derived from data that change in a predictable way on the approach to a 22 critical threshold. In epidemiology this threshold is commonly described as the point at 23 which the basic reproduction number, R 0 , passes through R 0 = 1. A system with R 0 24 increasing through 1 describes an emerging or endemic disease whereas R 0 decreasing 25 through 1 results in disease elimination. We seek to find EWS to identify when a 26 disease is approaching such a transition. We may identify such statistics using critical 27 slowing down (CSD) theory, which indicates the imminent approach of a threshold, 28 arising from increasing recovery times of perturbations as a system approaches a critical 29 transition [1, 2] . This increase in recovery time occurs because, as the stability of a 30 steady state changes, such as from a disease free state to emergence or from endemic 31 state to elimination, the dominant eigenvalue of the steady state passes through zero. 32 Since the eigenvalue also determines the relaxation time of the system, this recovery 33 time therefore increases as we approach a critical transition. 34 EWS offer the ability to anticipate a critical transition indirectly in real world noisy 35 time series data, by observing, for example, increasing variance or autocorrelation in the 36 fluctuations around the steady-state [2, 9] . Statistical indicators offer a computationally 37 inexpensive and efficient method for assessing the status of an infectious disease, 38 presenting a simple mechanism for disease surveillance and monitoring of control 39 policies. 40 The development of EWS is an active area of research in many fields, identifying the 41 statistical signatures of abrupt shifts in many dynamical systems. Studies have applied 42 EWS to historical data or laboratory experiments where a tipping point is 43 known [1, 13, 23] ; developed methods for using spatial variation [17, 18] , explored the 44 effects of detrending [8, 15] using the ensemble of multiple EWS [12, 13, 30] ; and datasets known to be going through a critical transition: from climate systems to stock 48 markets, to applications with ecological field data [16, 22, 23] . These studies observed 49 unexpected characteristic traits of common EWS, such as identifying a decreasing trend 50 in variance or standard deviation, leading to a discussion on the robustness of indicators. 51 It is therefore highly important to understand analytically how EWS are expected to 52 change on the approach to a critical transition for different data types to avoid any 53 misleading results. 54 The initial development of EWS in epidemiology focused on prevalence data, 55 producing analytical solutions and numerically testing the capabilities for statistical 56 indicators of emergence and elimination of infectious diseases [5] [6] [7] [8] . Analysis of 57 computer simulations of well-studied epidemiological systems have highlighted 58 challenges such as seasonality [6] or detrending of epidemiological time series data [8] .",

Strikingly, our results 88 demonstrate that although EWS of emergence exhibit an increasing variance, a trait demonstrate that variance instead decreases on the approach to a disease elimination 91 transition. We find that although incidence data does not undergo the transcritical 92 bifurcation traditionally considered by CSD theory, nevertheless time series trends are 93 still a valuable tool to predict disease elimination. The discrepancy between prevalence 94 and incidence on the one hand, and elimination and emergence on the other, could lead 95 to potential problems in detecting thresholds if the differences are not clearly 96 understood. 97 We introduce an analytical theory from stochastic processes to address why variance 98 in incidence decreases for disease elimination. We study multiple other indicators of disease elimination predicted by this theory, and compare their responses with 100 stochastic simulations. We also consider the rate of incidence as a measurement that 101 can be extracted from incidence data. Notably, we find that on the approach to a 102 critical transition the rate of incidence exhibits typical CSD signatures which 103 correspond with prevalence data, such as an increasing variance. We present a broad 104 analytical framework for EWS of incidence and rate of incidence for a variety of 105 different disease systems. We explore more intricate systems where elimination is driven 106 by different factors to understand the robustness of this theory. This simple generalised 107 result can be applied to many infectious diseases undergoing emergence or elimination, 108 a promising development for EWS of infectious diseases.",

This could result to misleading EWS 384 when used in practice. In the supporting text S1 Fig, we demonstrate that if the disease 385 is approaching elimination at a slower rate, both methods (\"true\" and \"approximated\") 386 converge to the analytical solution. We chose parameters such that Model 1 approaches 387 disease elimination at the same rate as Model 3 approaches disease emergence (R 0 388 changes from 1.2 to 0, \u03b2 {1} 0 = 0.24). As the system changes slowly enough then the 389 system will be approximately ergodic, such that the moving average resembles the mean 390 incidence. Thus the \"approximated\" method will be closer to the \"true\" solution. In 391 comparison, the faster a system changes over time, will correspond to a wider range in 392 incidence cases across the moving window.

We observe that the 397 analytical solution (Fig. 2(b) orange line) and true stochastic simulations (Fig. 2(b) 398 purple) only slightly increase before the critical transition, implying this trend would be 399 difficult to detect in real-world data. In particular, the Kendall-tau score which can be 400 an indication of an increasing trend, is negative (decreasing, \u03c4 = \u22121) for Model 2, 401 whilst for Model 1 and 3 we find that \u03c4 = 0.987 and \u03c4 = 1 respectively.

Potential applications include the observation of animals through 492 camera traps, disease surveillance sampling in wildlife or movements in stock prices, 493 which are all examples of incidence-type data.

The work we have presented here can be extended to include a gamma 510 distributed intensity \u03bb. Using a gamma distributed rate of incidence will account for 511 reporting errors as described by O'Dea et al.",

Therefore, we suggest that variance and 515 coefficient of variation are overall good indicators due to their high predictive power in 516 all cases. Coefficient of variation is a robust indicator for disease elimination since the 517 trend is similar between different types of data ( Fig. 3 (a) ) and S11 Fig. However   518 discrepancies are demonstrated when considering opposite disease thresholds as shown 519 with disease emergence (Fig. 3(b) ) which has a decreasing trend for CV and performs 520 less well with disease prevalence data.",

Our analytical exploration of incidence has 535 indicated a new data source, RoI, which can be extracted from incidence timeseries. A 536 potential powerful tool would be to compute variance and CV indicators with different 537 types of data (incidence, rate of incidence and prevalence) and ensemble these. An 538 ensemble or combination of multiple statistical indicators was suggested by Drake & 539 Griffen [13] and has been applied to case studies with the same data-type and a 540 combination of EWS by Kefi et al. [30] to help interpret between different critical 541 transitions and also has successfully detected transitions using an ensemble of different 542 time series data [12] . This suggests a potential approach to achieve a single metric from 543 a combination of indicators calculated on multiple timeseries data with different trends, 544 such as we have observed with incidence and RoI, to achieve a more pronounced 545 indication of disease transitions. 546 Additionally, further work would be to include a heterogeneous ensemble as 547 suggested by O'Dea et al. [4] , whereby all parameters are sampled randomly for each 548 realisation rather than being equal. This will lead to more realistic results, as each 549 parameter sample represents time series data from different locations, as suggested by 550 studies on spatial statistics, a promising method for addressing limited data [8, 17, 18] . 551 Comparatively, we have shown here that computing the statistics on a homogeneous 552 ensemble although unrealistic, it returns exact stochastic behaviours of the system and 553 we used this to verify the simulated study with the theory.",

We have researched the resemblance of 564 observed time series results between different data types, a necessary exploration for the 565 development of EWS before they can impact decision making.
