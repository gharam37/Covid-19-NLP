However, given the dynamic landscape of tRNA pools among tissues, it is unclear whether different viruses infecting different tissues have adapted their codon usage toward their tropism. Here, we collect the coding sequences of over 500 human-infecting viruses and determine that tropism explains changes in codon usage. Using an in silico model of translational efficiency, we validate the correspondence of the viral codon usage with the translational machinery of their tropism. In particular, we propose that the improved translational adaptation to the upper respiratory airways of the pandemic agent SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus could enhance its transmissibility. Furthermore, this correspondence is specifically defined in early viral proteins, as upon infection cells undergo reprogramming of tRNA pools that favors the translation of late counterparts.",

For instance, given the small size of most viral genomes, no or very few tRNA genes are generally autonomously encoded 5 . In terms of codon usage, it has indeed been shown that bacteriophages are specifically adapted to their microbial hosts 6, 7 . This information has been applied in the prediction of viral hosts from metagenomics data 8, 9 . The codon usage of human-infecting viruses is similarly adapted to the host 10, 11 , and actually the concept of codon deoptimization has been applied in the design of attenuated vaccines 12 . leading to changes in their respective translational efficiency 2, 14 . In agreement with this observation, the codon usage of papillomavirus capsid proteins is adapted to the tRNAs of differentiated keratinocytes, where their translation becomes specifically efficient 15, 16 . In addition, upon HIV-1 infection, the host tRNA pool is reprogrammed to favor translation of late viral genes 17 , a phenomenon that is indeed exploited by host antiviral mechanisms 18 . Furthermore, some viruses with a specific tissue tropism resemble the codon bias of highly expressed proteins of their respective infecting tissues 19 . Nevertheless, despite the few aforementioned studies, a high-throughput analysis of the translational selection of viral genomes to their tissue tropism has been heretofore hindered by the absence of tissue-wide tRNA expression data.",

The resulting performance of the models, based on the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of their Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, ranges between 0.74-0.91 ( Fig. 2A) , clearly higher than the no-skill model of 0.5. Similar results are also obtained from complementary prediction performance metrics such as Precision-Recall curves ( Fig. 2A) . These results indicate that our machine learning model is able to predict the tropism of a viral protein based on its SDA to tissues with high accuracy.

In both cases, the expression of their entry receptor coincides with an optimal translational adaptation in the lower respiratory tract.

In all cases, their expression throughout the airways (Fig. 3B ) alongside their efficient translational adaptation defines the upper respiratory tract and the alveoli as their particular optimal tropism (Fig. 3C ).

For instance, codon usage of Parvovirus has been progressively adapted from dogs to cats after the host jump 43 . Influenzaviruses show a similar adaptation over time of viral isolation, deviating from the codon usage of avian hosts 44, 45 . However, whether these progressive changes in codon usage over time are directly driven by translational selection has remained elusive. With the advent of tissue-wide datasets of tRNAs and their translational efficiencies 2 , we can now compute the Supply-to-Demand Adaptation (SDA) of all viral proteomes in different tissues. From there, we then created a random forest model that predicts with high accuracy the viral tropism of proteins based on their profile of adaptation to human tissues. In consequence, the tRNA-based adaptation profile of a protein is descriptive of their viral tropism, indicating that translational selection could indeed drive tropism differences of codon usage. It is important to remark that viruses could still have a good SDA to non-target tissues with similar tRNA expression patterns that are not infected because they are not exposed to the virus.",

This upper tract tropism has indeed been linked to the higher transmissibility of the strain 21 . The novel coronavirus showcases the highest SDA among all studied coronaviruses, including lung but also other tissues such as the digestive system and brain. Interestingly, recent reports have shown that COVID-19 patients very frequently have problems in the digestive tract 24,46,47 as well as in neural tissue 23 One major open question in the field still persists: how much natural selection before or after zoonosis shapes the current coronavirus 50 . On the one hand, viruses tend to gradually change their codon usage after a zoonotic jump 43, 45 . On the other hand, given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 SDA with the phylogenetically closest bat coronavirus, it seems that a translational selection to increase SDA would have acted before the putative zoonosis from bats or other intermediate hosts. Furthermore, in agreement with the highest translational potential of SARS-CoV-2 in their target tissues, a recent model of viral tropism suggested that a tradeoff exists between the efficiency of viral translation and the translational load on the host, indicating that an improved codon usage can make the difference between symptomatic and natural hosts 51 .",
