Currently, the world is facing a new pandemic generated by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen behind COVID-19. The virus and its related disease were unknown before the December 2019 outbreak of Wuhan (China). By January 30 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 situation as a public health emergency of international concern, and 41 days later, in March 11 2020, declared it as a global level pandemic (3) . By early April, there were 1.5 million worldwide contagion cases and more than 90,000 deaths (4).",

This virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets of infected persons, produced by breathing, sneezing and coughing, and into another individual via mucous membranes (e.g., nose, mouth, and eyes). Thus, the proximity between individuals and their long-distance mobility are two of the main drivers that have been identified in explaining the rapid dispersion of this new airborne disease. Hence, social distancing together with the isolation of infected patients have been suggested as two of the best procedures to decrease infection rates in the absence of a vaccine or other effective treatments (5) . In fact, governments from across the globe have promoted lockdowns in the past few weeks. Nonetheless, immerse in globalized practices that demand high mobility of large numbers of people, the daily migration rate across cities, .

Different epidemiological models have been developed for COVID-19 and adapted by to local conditions in order to guide public health actors to contain the rapid advance of this pandemic (7, 8) . Most of the existing models, however, do not consider mobility between locations, limiting our understanding on its role in the spatial spread of this highly contagious disease (but see 9, 10). Interestingly, initial COVID-19 cases in most countries were imported cases through international flights. But not only international flights are of concern, as many countries with large territories where domestic flights are the main way between distant locations, are highly important in understanding the spread of the disease. Yet, the importance of airport mobility has been largely overseen by most models, although airports could play a keystone role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, including them in further models could allow us to better predict the vulnerability of cities to COVID-19.",

Flights from cities with a high number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 are considered as an additional factor for the spread of the disease in the country, as already described for Brazil (10) . In addition to modeling how the COVID-19 will spread across the Mexican territory over time, we consider of crucial importance to know if Mexican cities are prepared with the required healthcare infrastructure to successfully deal with this pandemic under the simulated scenarios. For this, we also assessed the relevant public healthcare infrastructure of the Mexican cities that show to be most vulnerable to COVID-19 by our model. To do so, we calculated the number of infected patients that will need hospitalization on a daily basis. Finally, since social distancing guidelines are being shown to lower the rate of COVID-19 dispersion in many territories, we have also created scenarios of social distancing to simulate its effect on the number of people infected in Mexico over time.",

Given that the unit of time in our models is the day, \u0394t = 1, and \u0394N = Nt+1-Nt = I1-I2, or Nt+1 = Nt + (I1-I2). In this case, factor I1 was calculated as a fraction of infected patients (5%) that would require intensive care units, and to estimate I2 and Nt, we considered an average of 10 days in intensive care for each patient admitted at this level (following 20). Therefore, overloads occur at day t in which Nt is higher than the number of intensive care units available in the public healthcare system of a given city.",

Yet, we detected an impressive decrease in the rate of infection (i.e., flattening of the curve) in the 45% social distancing scenario. The percentage of infected people in the country in that last scenario would start to rise between days 284 and 436, to a maximum peak around day 375, with only 5.1% of the assessed population infected (3,039,553 infected people).

Thus, based on our model, we suggest that considerable efforts should be focused in these cities in order to control and monitor the spread of COVID-19. These cities have great potential to a large number of infected people and also could serve as a source of spread of the disease to other cities and regions of the country, and even playing a crucial role in further outbreaks of COVID-19.",

If the number of infected people continues to grow in the assessed Mexican cities as it did in Wuhan (China), for instance, no Mexican city would be prepared to deal with this pandemic. The latter is due to the estimate of 24.5 inpatient beds and 2.6 intensive care unit beds for every 10,000 people would be needed during the peak of the epidemic (21) . Among the focal assessed Mexican cities, only Villahermosa, La Paz, and Monterrey have a sufficient number of inpatient beds than the estimated ones that would be needed per 10,000 (i.e., 29.1, 26.7 and 24.7, respectively).

First, we only consider air transport to estimate the mobility of people between cities; however, the we are well aware that the Mexican road network is one important means of communication, representing an additional potential driver for the spatial spread of the disease. Second, our model only considers the health infrastructure in terms of inpatient and intensive care unit beds from the public healthcare network. Most recently, the Mexican Government increased hospital capacity in some cities, which could mold the outcome of our results if considered in the model. Third, there are additional factors that have been identified as important in facing the spread of COVID-19 (e.g., protective equipment, medical personnel, and mechanical ventilators; 23) that are not considered in our model. Finally, we assessed social distancing as a general grouping factor behind the decrease of contagion rates, which could not only include well known specific drivers of such phenomenon (e.g., thorough hand washing, staying at home, keeping distance when leaving home). Taking into account all of the limitations of our model and the available data used to construct it, we show how the Mexican air transport network could increase the vulnerability of cities to COVID-19. Also, our simulations suggest that the available public healthcare infrastructure in the most vulnerable studied focal cities is very likely to be insufficient to face this pandemic. Despite most scenarios derived from our model are not optimistic for the coming months, our model clearly shows that social distancing is a remarkable measure to control the growth rate of total COVID-19 cases before infection rates soar exponentially in the country. We observed important differences between 0-30% social distancing scenarios and that of 45%, where the curve is clearly flattened.",

We calibrated our model following a real time series from John Hopkins Coronavirus Research Center (16), which leads to \u03b2 = 0.245 and \u03b3 = 0.09 (standardized for 242 countries between February 1 and March 31, 2020).

Regarding our assessment of the potential overload of intensive care units across the focal 50 cities, we found that most of them lack the public health infrastructure to face the pandemic. Our results are clear in showing that cities that were identified to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 do not have a greater number of inpatient (rho = -0.21; p = 0.16. Figure 2A) nor intensive care units (rho = 0.26; p = 0.06;",

Woefully, most vulnerable cities lack of the required public health infrastructure (i.e., number of inpatient and intensive care unit beds) to face this pandemic considering the simulated infection numbers. Interestingly, when we simulated the effect of social distancing with our model, it shows that 45% of social distancing could decrease up to 78.7% the number of infected people, flattening the growth rate of people with COVID-19 before infection rates soar exponentially. Using the proposed SIR-Net model, we show that the most important cities within the Mexican air transportation network are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. Recently, Ribeiro et al (10) showed similar results for the modeled expansion of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil, with airport related to COVID-19 model severeness. Previous studies have shown that cities that serve as transfer points (i.e., airport hubs) are important drivers for the spread of diseases across the world. Indeed, the John Hopkins Coronavirus Research Center and other several monitors of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 across the world have shown that the critical starting points of the pandemic in many countries are airport hubs, such as Milan, Rome, Madrid, and New York. Results of this study together with previous knowledge suggest that controlling air traffic in key cities, mostly those with high airport closeness centrality, could mold globalized pandemics such as COVID-19. Thus, the implementation of timely airport sanitarian control could have slowed down the spreading of COVID-19 in countries with a massive flow of flight routes-a big lesson for future control of infections outbreaks. Regarding Mexican city vulnerability, our results clearly indicate that Monterrey, Guadalajara, and Mexico City are the most vulnerable cities to COVID-19. These Mexican cities are the most economically important urban centers in the country, are the most populated, and are directly connected with many cities from across the world through their international airports.",
