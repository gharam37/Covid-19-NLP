They are estimated by an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm, fixing all clinical parameters at the values chosen by Hill. A trio of transmission parameters (b1, b2, b3) then determines r through Getr -SEIR. The likelihood of the trio is taken to be the gaussian likelihood for the resulting value, with mean and sd given by the estimate and standard error of the growth coefficient in M1. A trio receives a higher or lower likelihood if the model gives a fitted log growth rate nearer or further from the empirical value obtained directly from the data. The prior for the trio is set as the product of independent gamma priors for each component, using the same shape and rate for each. Adaptive M-H was run (R package \"MHadaptive\") to generate a sample of length 50,000 after burn-in and thinning. Convergence was checked by standard diagnostic tests (R package \"coda\"). The output of M-H is a posterior sample of the trio (b1, b2, b3). Since R 0 is completely determined by the parameters, the rest of which are fixed, the sample generates a sample for R 0 .

The forecasts barely depend on how the 19 known cases on 28 February are assigned, but do depend on the unknown numbers that day of infected and infectious (mild) cases, inferred here from the growth rate in the exponential phase and the numbers of reported deaths. For example, if the ratio of infected / infection(mild) remains at 3.06 but the number of infected cases on 28 February is taken as 2000 rather than 1627, a 20% lockdown from 24 March to 16 June shows severe cases rising to over 72,000 whilst critical cases rise to nearly 43,000 and deaths total nearly 98,000.",

Other parameters concern the rate at which persons who have become infectious will infect others, depending on whether their clinical condition is mild, severe, or critical. Clinical parameters, such as the delay between \"infected\" and \"infectious\", may not vary greatly between countries. By contrast, the rate at which infection is transmitted in the community depends on level and types of social interaction, which may vary over time in response to public policy, such as a lockdown, or weather and season. For hospitalised patients, transmission also depends on the level of protection for healthworkers and environmental controls including cleaning and air quality. If the evolution of all these parameters were known, the model would predict the numbers of people in different stages of the disease, or death, over time. Of course 7 .

Even so, the data excludes deaths in care homes. However, if the proportion of hospital deaths as a fraction of all COVID-19 deaths remained constant during the early phase, log(deaths) would simply be offset by a constant, and therefore the estimate and standard error of its slope would be unaffected.",
