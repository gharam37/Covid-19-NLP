Since the models are stochastic in nature, there isn't a simple analytical form that we can minimize. Additionally, rather than fitting for only the parameters themselves, we would also like to quantify how certain we are about those parameters. We therefore employ an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) technique to compare our simulations to observations and recover the posterior distributions of \u03b2 and \u03b3 (Figure 1 ). This technique was previously used to fit initial mass functions to nearby galaxies (Gennaro et al. 2018) . The general goal of ABC is to sample the posterior distributions of simulation parameters such that the simulations match the observed data. In practice, it is impossible for simulations to exactly match data due to noise and ill-posed models. Additionally, if the observable space is continuous, then the probability of simulations exactly matching observations is exactly zero. Therefore, we define some distance d between simulations and observations, as well as a tolerance . We accept those parameters who produce simulations are d < away from the observed data. By initially sampling from the prior distributions of the parameters and iteratively shrinking the tolerance up to some stopping criterion, we 'shrink' the prior into the posterior.",

The fit is less perfect for the individual infected-recovered curves. This is to be expected, since the real-world obviously does not truly follow an SIR model. There are various externalities like spatial effects and government/healthcare responses. Our simple SIR model also lacks vital statistics like births and deaths. For a fatal illness like SARS-CoV-2, it would be valuable to add these parameters to the model. However, for the purpose of this proof-of-concept study, we estimate that adding these parameters will negligibly affect the goodness-of-fit of the total confirmed cases (Chen & Li 2020) . We extrapolate the model for each region by allowing it to run until no active infections remain (Fig. 3) . We find a consistent extrapolated infection profile for all the provinces under study. This indicates a similar level of government response after the first infections were reported, despite differing population sizes in each region. We quantify the 'steepness' of the infection curve by dividing the maximum number of active infected patients by the total length of the extrapolated infection curve, i.e. the duration of the epidemic. We compare the steepness of different Chinese provinces in Fig. 4 .",
