Mathematical models can help define the scale of an epidemic and the rate at which an infection can spread in a community. We used an SIR model to predict the magnitude of the COVID-19 epidemic in Pakistan and compared the numbers with the reported cases on the national database. Our results indicate that Pakistan could hit peak number of infectious cases on May 26th, 2020 and by June 24th, 2020, 90% of the population will have become infected with the virus if policy interventions seeking to curb this infection are not adopted aggressively.",

The patient zero had a travel history to Iran and immediately quarantined upon testing positive for the virus. However, the patient was followed by hundreds of pilgrims returning from Iran which were likely carrying the virus that ultimately led to the spread of COVID-19 into the community. Since then the infections have been increasing exponentially and without proper intervention the situation may escalate enough to overwhelm the already struggling healthcare system in the country. recovered cases (R) are compartments and each individual of a given population will pass through the susceptible phase then to the infected phase and finally to the recovered phase. The SIR model is a steady state model, therefore the population that is analysed is static i.e. no one is being born or is dying. Additionally, the model assumes that once a person is infected, they are immune to the disease and therefore cannot contract it again. The SIR model is ideal for modelling the spread of diseases spread through person to person contact.",

The graph shows an exponential growth pattern for the 32-day data extracted from the NIH, Pakistan database. On day 1 of the epidemic the number of cases were 2 and on day 32 the number of daily reported cases 211. These numbers may represent the gap in the unreported or asymptomatic cases in Pakistan. The x-axis corresponds to the days, whereas the y-axis corresponds to the number of cases. The SIR model for the spread of COVID-19 in Pakistan (figure 5.3), under the assumptions mentioned in Model Parameters, indicate that the number of infections will peak on Day 91 (26 th May 2020), where 5,921,1209 individuals could be potentially infected. The number of infections will rapidly decreaseand on the 120 th day (24 th June 2020) the number of infected cases will stand at 369, 8192, whereas 198,761,399 cases will have recovered which is approximately 90% of the Pakistani population. We also superimposed the modelled data with the reported numbers (figure 5.4). Our calculations suggest that a significant correlation (r=0.97, p<0.001) between the modelled trajectory the actual number of reported cases. Therefore, the current values for R\u02f3, \u03b2 and \u03b3 seem to be accurate for the population",
