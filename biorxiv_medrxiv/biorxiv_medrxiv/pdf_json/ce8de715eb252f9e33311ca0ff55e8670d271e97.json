Here we showcase an orthogonal pipeline we call CREST (Cas13-based, Rugged, Equitable, Scalable Testing) that addresses some of these hurdles. Specifically, CREST pairs commonplace and reliable biochemical methods (PCR) with low-cost instrumentation, without sacrificing detection sensitivity. By taking advantage of simple fluorescence visualizers, CREST allows for a binary interpretation of results. CREST may provide a pointof-care solution to increase the distribution of COVID-19 surveillance.",

In addition, these risk mitigation efforts have a catastrophic economic and social impact, which makes long-term compliance challenging until a vaccine or treatment is widely available 7 . To reduce the socioeconomic burden, we need to implement effective containment measures, such as contact tracing, quarantine of confirmed cases, and enhanced surveillance, all of which depend on data obtained from widespread testing 8 . Proactive, prevalent, and regular testing have been effective measures for the control of COVID-19 in countries such as South Korea and Taiwan, and will be required for the establishment of effective strategies for the relaxation of socialdistancing measures worldwide 9,10 .",

To lower the barrier to COVID-19 diagnostics, we devised a method we call CREST (Cas13-based, Rugged, Equitable, Scalable Testing). CREST addresses three of the main hurdles-reagent accessibility, equipment availability, and cost-that limit the scalability of Cas13-based testing, by taking advantage of widely available enzymes, low-cost thermocyclers, and easy-to-use fluorescent visualizers. Moreover, CREST is equivalent in sensitivity to the gold standard reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method most often deployed for COVID-19 testing. With these advantages, CREST has the potential to facilitate early detection of positive cases, regular monitoring of individuals at high risk, and implementation of informed containment measures for infected individuals.",

While sensitivity is high (on the order of tens of target molecules per microliter), the main limitation is the requirement of real-time thermocyclers, analysis software, and trained personnel for data interpretation. Limitations aside, the core of the technologyamplification of a target nucleic acid sequence by PCR-is robust, sensitive, and makes use of a widely-available enzyme, Taq polymerase. These advantages motivated us to pair PCR with CRISPR-based detection of viral sequences, an approach that has been previously successful for the detection of DNA sequences using Cas9 20 . The thermocyclers required for PCR are expensive, specialized instruments that are generally limited to a professional laboratory. However, the recent DIY-Bio movement has made PCR accessible through the creation of affordable, Bluetoothenabled, field-ready thermocyclers, which can even be battery operated. These versatile thermocyclers can be used in unconventional environments and perform as well as traditional thermocyclers in moderate temperatures [21] [22] [23] . We reasoned that these devices, such as the miniPCR mini16, offer a low-cost solution for the amplification of the viral target material and can make COVID-19 testing widely available (Fig. 2) .",

When bound to its target Cas13 catalyzes the non-specific cleavage of RNAs. This target-specific recognition can be detected in many ways, for example either by lateral flow immunochromatography or by fluorescence visualization. Lateral flow test strips are a promising detection method. These strips utilize capillary action to move analytes through a solid support material striped with antibodies that can detect them, resulting in binary readouts. While simple to use and read-they may eventually enable in-home testing-their current availability is limited and they are expensive relative to the costper-test (Fig. 3B, Sup. Spreadsheet) .

Briefly, we PAGE purified annealed synthetic DNA oligonucleotides flanked by an upstream T7 RNA polymerase promoter that encode sequences corresponding to the N1, N2, and N3 sites in the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene (Table S3 ). Next, we transcribed the DNA in vitro to obtain target RNAs. After Cas13 purification and extensive optimization of the reaction conditions (Fig. S1 , S2), we used these targets to determine the detection limit of the CREST protocol and found that we could detect up to 10 copies of a target RNA molecule per microliter (Fig. 2B) . This result shows that CREST is as sensitive as the corresponding RT-qPCR in our hands, demonstrating the power of CREST for pairing a thermal cycling amplification step (PCR) with a linear amplification step (transcription), combined with enzymatic signal amplification through fluorescence detection.",

Spreadsheet). In addition, the upfront cost of CREST instrumentation is 30 to 50 times lower. Second, we compared the RT-DNA amplification step of CREST to a variety of Cas13-based protocols that utilize RT-Recombinase Polymerase The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.052159 doi: bioRxiv preprint Amplification (RT-RPA). We found thermal cycling amplification (20 cycles) to be substantially more efficient with comparable amplification reaction times (Fig. 3A, Fig. S3 ). Moreover, in stark contrast to the proprietary, high-cost, relatively small batch production rates of reagents required for RPA, Taq polymerase, which has been in highvolume production for decades, and has been a workhorse of modern molecular biology, is readily accessible, stable at room temperature, and lowers costs significantly (Fig. 3B) . Lastly, we compared lateral flow test strip visualization to CREST, and while we found them to equally as sensitive as fluorescent detection methods (Fig. 3A) , their high cost and difficulty to obtain can limit their distribution and scaled use in this pandemic.",

These state-ofthe-art methods are scalable, do not entail specialized instrumentation, and require very little specialized training. We designed CREST to capitalize on the strengths of both RT-qPCR and CRISPR-based detection, while addressing their shortcomings. CREST exploits the robustness and reliability of PCR, while harnessing the combined sensitivity and convenience of a coupled transcription-detection reaction. CREST can be run, from RNA sample to result, with no need for AC power or a dedicated facility, with minimal handling in ~2 hours. Because the signal saturates even at low input levels (Fig. 2B ) CREST offers the added advantage of binary result interpretation, similar to lateral flow test strips, but at a fraction of the price, as it does not require the costly antibodies or antibody-conjugates needed for lateral flow immunochromatography. Finally, while purified Cas13 is not yet commercially available, we were able to purify enough protein from a 1-liter bacterial culture for more than 500,000 reactions, and we can provide aliquots of protein upon request. Increasing the potential for field deployment of Cas13 for massive POC testing will require additional optimizations, such as lyophilization.",
