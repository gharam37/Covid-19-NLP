Recently, it has been demonstrated that RT-PCR has the sensitivity to detect one positive case in a mixed sample of 32 cases [12] , In this paper we propose adaptive group testing strategies based on generalized binary splitting (GBS) [5], where we restrict the group test to the largest group that can be used. The method starts by choosing a group from the population to be tested, performing a test on the combined sample from the entire group, and progressively splitting the group further into subgroups. Compared to individual testing at 4% prevalence, we save 74%; at 1% we save 91%; and at .1% we save 98% of tests. We analyze the number of times each sample is used and show that the method is still ecient if we resort to testing a case individually if the sample is running low.",

The goal of this paper is to increase the capacity to identify asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 by applying group testing methods. Current practice typically involves a one-patient-one-test strategy. Recently the potential to detect COVID-19 RNA in a mixture of samples from individuals has been validated [12] using RT-PCR.

If the measurement is sensitive to detect one positive in groups of size twice up to 16 as large as the current maximum, then optimally ecient testing can be carried out. It might be the case that a full binary search of the group puts too much strain on the laboratory work ow.

The number of bits per +/-status of a case steeply increases in the beginning and levels o at 1. This expresses the negative relationship between the eectiveness of group-testing and increasing prevalence.The results of 9.1 indicate the near optimality of divide and test. It recovers nearly a bit of information for each test. For low prevalence, the conrmation of each case holds a very low amount of entropy.
