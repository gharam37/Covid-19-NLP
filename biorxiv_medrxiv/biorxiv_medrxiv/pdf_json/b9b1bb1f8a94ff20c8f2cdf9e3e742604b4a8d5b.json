Therefore, the present study does 215 not consider this parameter as an evaluation index for disease progression. The average values of 216 D-dimer and FDP before treatment was higher in the LMWH group than in the control group (3\u00b775, 217 1\u00b723, p< 0\u00b701; 14\u00b735, 4\u00b705, p<0\u00b701), therefore LMWH was applied.

            "text": "222 Apart of its anticoagulant activity, there are other routes to explain a favorable effect of LMWH on 223 COVID-19 patients. Heparan sulfate (HS), a linear polyanionic polysaccharide, is a major constituent 224 of all mammalian cells and tissues. 26 It highly resembles heparin and LMWH in its structural properties 225 and sugar composition. 26 Importantly, HS has been known to serve as the first point of contact between 226 target cells and a large number of human viruses (i.e., dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, human 227 immunodeficiency virus, human papilloma virus, herpes viruses), 27,28 including the SARS-CoV-2 228 virus. 29,30 A very recent online paper has used surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism and 229 showed that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain interacts with heparin. 30 230 Heparin, LMWH and heparin-like compounds have been shown to efficiently compete with HS and 231 thereby attenuate viral attachment and infection, 31 providing a straightforward explanation for the 232 anti-viral effect of LMWH in clinical settings. 233 Importantly, as clarified below, recent studies expanded the established role of HS from a viral 234 attachment molecule to an essential receptor required for entry. Heparin, LMWH and 235 non-anticoagulants species of heparin are known to inhibit the enzymatic activity of heparanase, 32 the 236 sole HS-degrading endoglycosidase, shown recently to promote viral infection and spread. 33-35 It 237 appears that heparanase behaves as a molecular switch in viral infection, which transforms the cell 238 from a virus-permissive mode in which viral attachment and entry are favored, to a virus-deterring 239 mode which allows for viral detachment and egress from cells. 33 Briefly, it was found that upregulation 240 and activation of heparanase is a strategy common to a broad range of viral species (i.e., PRRSV, 241 vaccinia virus) to increase egress, spread and transmission. 35 Interestingly, it appears that heparanase 242 plays a role also in driving the undesirable cytokine storm discussed above. In individuals with 243 SARS-CoV-2 infection, the level of inflammatory cytokines is markedly higher than normal and held 244 responsible for the severity of the disease. Agelidis et al. documented that upon HSV-1 infection, 245 heparanase translocate to the nucleus of the infected cells and promotes inflammatory signaling, 246 mediated primarily via NF-\u03baB. 35 In fact, transcription of IL-6 was significantly decreased after 247 treatment with an inhibitor of heparanase enzymatic activity. 35 LMWH which inhibits heparanase 248 activity 32 may have a similar effect, possibly providing a mechanistic explanation for the decrease in 249 IL-6 that we observed in the LMWH treated patients. Collectively, the above considerations suggest 250 that heparanase inhibitors (i.e., LMWH) may be an effective strategy in a therapeutic or combination 251 therapy against viral infection, including COVID-19. Additional studies showed that inhibition of the 252 glycocalyx-degrading enzymes sialidase, cathepsin L and heparanase, using a combination therapy of 253 zanamavir, cathepsin-L and heparanase inhibitors, decreased vascular leakage after exposure to the 254 influenza virus NS1 protein in vitro and in vivo. 36 It will be interesting to see if an analogous 255 therapeutic inhibition of glycocalyx breakdown can provide similar benefit clinically. 256 Several studies have recommended CRP and lymphocyte% (LYM%) as indices for evaluating the 257 effectiveness of clinical drugs or treatments. 5,37,38 In the various analyses applied in this study,",

LMWH was reported to reduce the 270 release of IL-6 in the body by inhibiting the expression of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB). 13-15 Measuring 271 the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients, we have found a marked decrease in 272 the levels of IL-6 in the LMWH treated patients compared to the patients without LMWH treatment 273 (p<0\u00b7001), consistent with the proposed protective effect of LMWH. Changes in other inflammatory 274 factors were not statistically significant. In addition, IL-6 can bind to HS on the cell surface, yielding a 275 sufficiently high local concentration to activate signaling receptors, 40 protect them against proteolysis, 276and promote paracrine action. 18,41 An earlier study has reported that heparin binds IL-6, with affinity 277 much higher than that of HS, 18 thereby reducing its availability to its receptor complex. It, therefore, 278 appears that LMWH reduces both the release of IL-6 and its biological activity.279 Collectively, LMWH not only improves the coagulation dysfunction of COVID-19 patients, 42 but 280 exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by means of reducing IL-6 and increasing LYM%. We, therefore, 281 favor the use of LMWH as a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of COVID-19. We also 282 suggest that non-anticoagulant species of LMWH that can be applied at high doses should be 283 considered as a complement to conventional LMWH. To further support this conclusion, we are 284 conducting a prospective clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of one LMWH (enoxaparin) 285 in the treatment of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry \uff0c 286 number:chiCTR2000030700), with the objective of providing a more powerful reference for the 287 treatment conditions. 288 Limitations: This study has several limitations. First, due to the retrospective design, we were unable 289 to control the time intervals between examinations of the various indices in patients and the LMWH 290 treatment schedule. Likewise, we could not estimate and manage the effective dose and timing of 291 LMWH. Second, there were no critical cases in the two groups of patients; the treatment outcome of all 292 cases was improvement and discharge, and there were no deaths. Finally, the findings are limited by the 293 sample size and single-center design of our study.",
