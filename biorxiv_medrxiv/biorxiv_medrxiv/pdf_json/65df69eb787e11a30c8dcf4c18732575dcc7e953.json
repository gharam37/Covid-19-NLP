As of April 10, 2020, the virus has 19 rapidly disseminated to over 200 countries and territories, causing more than 1.6 million confirmed cases 20 of COVID-19 and 97,000 deaths worldwide. The clinical presentation of COVID-19 is fairly non-specific, 21 and symptoms overlap with other seasonal respiratory infections concurrently circulating in the 22 population. Further, it is estimated that up to 80% of infected individuals experience mild symptoms or 23 are asymptomatic, confounding efforts to reliably diagnose COVID-19 empirically. To support infection 24 control measures, there is an urgent need for rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics to identify COVID-25 19 positive patients. In the present study, we have evaluated the analytical sensitivity and clinical 26 performance of four SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic assays granted Emergency Use Authorization by 27 the FDA using nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic patients. This information is crucial for both 28 laboratories and clinical teams, as decisions on which testing platform to implement are made. 29 30",

Accurate and actionable results have been at the core 233 of medical decision-making during this current outbreak, both in the inpatient and outpatient setting. Our data suggest that all four PCR methods yielded comparable results (\u03ba \u2265 0.96); however, we 250 did observe a notable difference in the sensitivity of the methods during this large-scale evaluation of EUA 251 in vitro diagnostic assays.

In 258 contrast, GenMark could only detect 100% of replicates at 1,000 copies/mL, and was not able to reliably 259 detect replicates below 1,000 copies/mL, thus patient specimens below this concentration range could 260 potentially be missed.

These steps, especially the pipetting of the specimen into the lysis tube, can be somewhat labor 296 intensive and time consuming, bumping the overall turnaround time for 120 specimens closer to the 7 297 hour mark.

First, this was a single center study 305 and the majority of the specimens were frozen after initial testing on the GenMark assay. While these 306 limitations are present, they have been minimized by the fact that GenMark assay (which was the least 307 sensitive platform in the analysis) actually had a potential competitive advantage, since it was the assay 308 initially performed on fresh specimens. Second, while the number of specimens included in the clinical 309 correlation was only 104, the patient samples spanned the entire range of clinical positives and reflected 310 our overall true positivity rate, which was between 50-60% during this time period of the COVID-19 311 outbreak. 312",

Likewise, results are just as critical in the outpatient setting as the basis for social 236 distancing measures to slow the spread of infection. To that end, false negative results are particularly 237 troubling, since they inevitably lead to more exposures. Turnaround time is also critical for allocation of 238 limited resources, such as the limited availability of isolation rooms and real-time cohorting decisions. In 239 addition, healthcare workers need rapid results to ensure they are not exposing patients whom they are 240 treating. Moreover, levels of personal protective equipment (PPE) required by health care professionals 241 also vary depending on whether a patient is COVID-19 positive, requiring a rapid TAT to preserve precious 242 resources. Considering the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, which has recently been estimated to have a 243 basic reproduction number (R0) of 2.2, meaning that on average, each infected person can spread the 244 infection to an additional two persons, a false negative result can be devastating (15, 16).
