It is the duty of any society to be responsive to such challenges by relying on the best tools and logic available to analyze the costs and benefits of any mitigative action. We here provide a mathematical model to explore the epidemiological consequences of allowing standard intake and unaltered within-jail operational dynamics to be maintained during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and contrast this with proposed interventions to reduce the burden of negative health outcomes. In this way, we provide estimates of the infection risks, and likely loss of life, that arise from current incarceration practices. We provide estimates for in-custody deaths and show how the within-jail dynamics lead to spill-over risks, not only affecting the incarcerated people, but increasing the exposure, infection, and death rates for both corrections officers with whom they interact within the jail system, and the broader community beyond the justice system. We show that, given a typical jail-community dynamic, operating in a business as usual way will result in significant and rapid loss of life. Large scale reductions in arrest and speeding of releases are likely to save the lives of incarcerated people, staff and the community at large.",

These descriptors make jails highly likely not only to place detained 29 people at increased risk of infection and resulting severe outcomes, but also to function 30 as a driver for increased infectivity, adversely impacting attempts to contain and 31 mitigate disease spread in the broader communities in which jails are located. To study 32 the dynamics of this system and provide quantitative metrics for risk to incarcerated 33 populations and the populations with which incarcerated people necessarily interact, we 34 construct and tailor a epidemiological model of COVID-19 transmission, and then use 35 that model to consider how some possible reforms to the system (i.e. reduction in arrest 36 intake, increased rates of returning incarcerated people to their homes, and 37 improvement of conditions within the jails) will alter these baseline risks. 38 Model/Methods 39 Transmission Model 40 We begin by tailoring a standard SEIR model to the specific dynamics of COVID-19. 41 We first split our total population into four categories of risk: Children under 18 42 (denoted with the subscript K), Low-risk adults (denoted with the subscript L), 43 High-risk adults (denoted with the subscript H), and Elderly adults (denoted with the 44 subscript E). We also designate a separate population category for jail staff, O (note: consider death from any non-COVID-19 cause; this is done to highlight the 58 COVID-19-specific dynamics. Additionally, as a simplifying assumption due to their low 59 rates of both infections and complications, we do not model hospitalizations or deaths 60 in children. Similarly, once hospitalized, patients are assumed not to spread COVID-19 61 further, as additionally modeling the impact of healthcare-associated COVID-19 cases is 62 well beyond the scope of this model. Lastly, we split our population into segments 63 depending on the subsection of the community or jail system in which they are 64 currently functioning: the community at large, C, the processing system for the jail, P , 65 the court system T , and the jail system, J.",

According to [19] , the yearly 98 number of admissions to prison is about 600,000 while the yearly number of admissions 99 to jail is around 10.6 million. So, assuming that all prison admissions first had one jail 100 admissions, around 95% of all jail admissions do not go on to prison; they are released 101 back into the community as in our model.

These scenarios are detailed below 163 in Table 3 . Most scenarios are additive; that is, all arrest reduction interventions 164 assume a baseline scenario of shelter-in-place in the community. The scenarios involving 165 faster release of individuals in jail all assume both shelter-in-place in the community, 166 and were each run under each of the \"Arrest Reduction\" scenarios to determine the 167 cumulative effects of arrest reduction, increased release rates, and community 168 shelter-in-place conditions. The mixing reduction scenario in the jail assumes 169 shelter-in-place in the community as well as a 25% reduction in arrests (equivalent to 170 the \"Bail Eligible\" Arrest Reduction scenario), as it is unlikely that jails will be able to 171 effectively reduce contact rates without reducing their average daily population.

It is therefore more 322 effective to reduce the intake rate across the entire population than to attempt to single 323 out particular categories of individuals due to their likely susceptibility to severe 324 morbidity or mortality from infection. The larger the reduction in overall intake, the 325 greater the reduction in disease achieved for all populations (incarcerated people, the 326 broader community, and jail staff, in decreasing proportion of effect). These broader 327 interventions are also likely to be relatively straightforward to implement 328 administratively, without knowledge of an individual's underlying comorbidities, if any. 329 In addition to reducing rates of intake into the jail system, another obvious, concrete 330 step we might take to reduce disease risks for everyone is to increase the rate of release 331 from jails. This should clearly be coupled with a decreased rate of intake rather than 332 enacted in isolation, since increasing release rates while maintaining the same rate of 333 intake would increase infection risks for incarcerated people, the staff who work at the 334 jails and court systems, and the broader community. This may even still occur when 335 expedited release is coupled with decreased rates of intake if the rate of release is To be maximally effective, each of these interventions should anticipate, rather than 340 react to, widespread infection incidence in jail populations.",

The inherent 366 nature of emerging epidemics makes both of these things uncertain -the clinical and 367 biological aspects of the pathogen might not be fully understood, and the data needed 368 to parameterize these models is often sparse and incomplete. This problem is especially 369 acute in models of this sort, which seek to present a \"what-if\" scenario to stave off a 370 public health crisis, rather than analyze how that crisis unfolded after the fact.",
