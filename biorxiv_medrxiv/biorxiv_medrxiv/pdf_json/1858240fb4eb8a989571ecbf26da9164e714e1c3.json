According to the best estimates, the confinement measures enforced in Spain on March 14 achieved only a mobility reduction of 60 \u00b1 5% 3, 4 during the first week, a quantity that, according to our model, falls short to drive the system below the targeted R < 1.",

It is observed that the reduction of mobility due to the confinement of the population has a highly nonlinear effect on the reduction of the epidemic. This makes the task of policy makers notoriously difficult, as they need to design realistic, implementable, confinement measures that reduce the impact of the epidemic sufficiently within the shortest time frame possible. If the interventions planned are too weak, the epidemic will not cease and the surge capacity of healthcare systems will be surpassed, leaving many individuals requiring hospitalization out of the attention they need. Furthermore, once policy makers realize the insufficiency of the interventions put in place, the epidemic may have spread up to a point such that only the most severe interventions will be of real use. On the other side, implementing very strict confinement measures from an early stage would give governments a much needed time to prepare against the attack of the disease, but would most likely take a huge toll in the economy, and consequently, in the population.",

We analytically relate the R of the evolution of COVID-19, in a demographically heterogeneous structured population, to the mobility patterns and the permeability of households under confinement. We derive a mathematical expression that allows us to anticipate the result of mobility restrictions and confinement on the effective reproduction number of the spreading of COVID-19 in any specific region. The dependence of R on the average mobility is nonlinear, and presents a sudden transition at R = 1. This transition separates a regime in which the mobility restrictions smoothly slow down the number of cases -the effect known as flattening the curve-, to a regime in which these restrictions sharply decelerate the number of cases -which we refer to as bending the curve-. The difference in the outcome of these two scenarios is very pronounced. First, the curve bending strategy provokes a drastic reduction in the infection speed, attaining a lower attack rate than the flattening strategy.",

We develop an age-stratified metapopulation compartmental model that encapsulates the particularities of the spreading of COVID-19 regarding (i) its transmission among individuals, (ii) the specificities of certain demographic groups with respect to the impact of COVID- 19, and (iii) the human mobility patterns inside and among regions. The full dynamics of the epidemics is formalized in terms of a Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) [12] [13] [14] . We refer the reader to the Methods section for a full description of the model and to the Supplementary Note 1 for the complete analysis of the Markovian equations. This model has been used to assess the necessity for total lockdown in Spain, finally enforced on March 30th 15 , for it allows a direct assessment of mobility restrictions and confinement policies.",

Once initialized the equations with the initial infectious seeds with the first reported cases up to March 3, we let the model evolve in the free-mobility regime until March 14, when the first mobility restrictions enter into play in Spain and, consequently, confinement is imposed in the model. Once validated the model, we study how enforcing mobility restriction and social distancing can drastically change the course of the epidemics. In the left panel of Figure 2 , we show the number of new cases per day for different levels of confinement, \u03ba 0 . The real value of \u03ba 0 has been assessed from official data on the use of public transportation, cars entrance and exits in cities, and pedestrians flows tracked through cellphones. The confinement is applied at time t c corresponding to March 14. It is observed that, as confinement is applied to a small fraction of the population (\u03ba 0 > 0), the curve for the number of new cases per day starts to broaden and the maximum shifts forward in time. Such a mitigation strategy is known as -flattening the curve-, in which containment delays and lowers the incidence peak. The consequence of the flattening scenario is that the impact over health systems is ameliorated at the expense of a larger epidemic period.

We use a previous framework for the study of epidemics in structured metapopulations, with heterogeneous agents, subjected to recurrent mobility patterns [7, 17, 10, 18] .To understand the geographical diffusion of the disease, as a result of human-human interactions in small geographical patches, one has to combine the contagion process with the long-range disease propagation due to human mobility across different spatial scales. For the case of epidemic modeling, the metapopulation scenario is as follows. A population is distributed in a set of patches, being the size (number of individuals) of each patch in principle different. The individuals within each patch are well-mixed, i.e., pathogens can be transmitted from an infected host to any of the healthy agents placed in the same patch with the same probability. The second aspect of our metapopulation model concerns the mobility of agents. Each host is allowed to change its current location and occupy another patch, thus fostering the spread of pathogens at the system level. Mobility of agents between different patches is usually represented in terms of a network where nodes are locations while a link between two patches represents the possibility of moving between them.",

Another key point is the introduction of a differentiation of the course of the epidemics that depends on the demographic ages of the population. This differentiation is very relevant in light of the observation of a scarcely set of infected individuals at ages (< 25), and also because of the severe situations reported for people at older ages (> 65). Our model is composed of the following epidemiological compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), asymptomatic infectious (A), infected (I), hospitalized to ICU (H), dead (D), and recovered (R). Additionally, we divide the individuals in N G age strata, and suppose the geographical area is divided in N regions or patches. Although we present the model in general form, its application to COVID-19 only makes use of the three age groups mentioned above (N G = 3): young people (Y), with age up to 25; adults (M), with age between 26 and 65; and elderly people (O), with age larger than 65.",

Susceptible individuals get infected by contacts with asymptomatic and infected agents, with a probability \u03a0 g i , becoming exposed. Exposed individuals turn into asymptomatic at a certain rate \u03b7 g , which in turn become infected at a rate \u03b1 g . Once infected, two paths emerge, which are reached at an escape rate \u00b5 g . The first option is requiring hospitalization in an ICU, with a certain probability \u03b3 g ; otherwise, the individuals become recovered. While being at ICU, individuals have a death probability \u03c9 g , which is reached at a rate \u03c8 g . Finally, ICUs discharge at a rate \u03c7 g , leading to the recovered compartment.

Regarding epidemiological parameters, the incubation period has been reported to be \u03b7 \u22121 + \u03b1 \u22121 = 5.2 days [12] in average which, in our formalism, must be distributed into the exposed and asymptomatic compartments. In principle, if one does not expect asymptomatic transmissions, most of this time should be spent inside the exposed compartment, thus being the asymptomatic infectious compartment totally irrelevant for disease spreading. However, along the line of several recent works [13, 15, 5] we have found that the unfolding of COVID-19 cannot be explained without accounting for infections from individuals not developing any symptoms previously. In particular, our best fit to reproduce the evolution of the real cases reported so far in Spain yields \u03b1 \u22121 = 2.86 days as asymptomatic infectious period. In turn, the infectious period while being symptomatic is established as \u00b5 \u22121 = 7 days [1, 20] , except for the young strata, for which we have reduced it to 1 day, assigning the remaining 6 days as asymptomatic; this is due to the reported mild symptoms in young individuals, which may become inadvertent [2] . Furthermore, we have included an isolation factor \u03bd = 0.6 which reduces the infectiousness of symptomatic agents as a result of their self-isolation. We fix the fatality rate \u03c9 = 42% of ICU patients by studying historical records of dead individuals as a function of those requiring intensive care. In turn, we estimate the period from ICU admission to death as \u03c8 \u22121 = 7 days [19] and the stay in ICU for those overcoming the disease as \u03c7 \u22121 = 20 days [1] .",
