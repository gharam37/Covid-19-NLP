Particularly in the early phases of an epidemic, effective public messaging from trusted authorities is crucial for maintaining public assurance, but is challenging because of uncertainty in the level and sources of risk and the effectiveness of mitigation measures. Actions that reduce population anxiety and promote self-efficacy, however, could help to promote positive behaviour change to reduce the spread of infection. Between February and March 2020, we conducted online surveys in Singapore, China and Italy -three countries at different stages of the epidemic -to measure population knowledge, perceptions and behaviour in relation to the COVID-19 epidemic in each country.",

These included personal hygiene behaviours and other protective measures, avoidance of workplaces, public spaces, social engagements or public transportation, changes to work-related or personal travel plans, and stockpiling of groceries, medications or personal protective equipment. Additionally, we included questions related to confidence in government and epidemic control measures, and acceptance of quarantine measures from previous published surveys. 6, 7 The basic questionnaire (Appendix A) was the same in all countries, but was modified to include countryspecific response options or epidemic control measures. In China, it was not possible to include questions on confidence in government control measures. In addition, we omitted the majority of questions on knowledge from the Italian questionnaire as it was apparent by the time the survey was administered that the vast majority of the population would be aware of how COVID-19 was acquired, what the signs and symptoms were and what control measures had been implemented. The survey was administered in English in Singapore, in Chinese in China, and in Italian for respondents in Italy.",

Respondents' anxiety was also a catalyst in their adoption of positive behavioural responses to reduce risk of infection -in particular, Singaporean respondents with higher levels of anxiety and self-efficacy were more likely to adopt positive preventive measures, consistent with previous studies done during the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. 9 Conversely, Singaporean respondents with greater confidence in authority were less likely to adopt positive behaviours; high trust in government control measures could lead to passivity in individual response through behavioural change. In both Chinese and Italian respondents, higher scores of superstition and fatalism were also associated with less positive behavioural change. This agrees with previous literature suggesting that belief that health status is largely determined by external forces makes individuals less likely to adopt behaviours that can positively impact one's health outcomes. 10 Overall anxiety levels and adoption of positive behaviours were strongly influenced by information sufficiency in all three countries, showing that population-level risk perception, self-efficacy and response to an outbreak can be intensified or attenuated by the quantity and quality of information provided. 11, 12 These findings highlight the importance of disseminating authoritative information from trusted health and government authorities through a variety of online and traditional media outlets, especially during the initial phase of an outbreak.
