In the case of highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome 57 (MERS)-CoV, we recently showed that autophagy is limited by a virus-induced AKT1-dependent 58 activation of the E3-ligase S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2), which targets the key autophagy 59 initiating protein Beclin-1 (BECN1) for proteasomal degradation (10). Congruently, inhibition of SKP2 60 by different compounds, including clinically approved drugs, stabilized BECN1 and limited MERS-CoV 61 propagation, indicating that autophagy-inducing compounds hold promise for evaluation as antiviral 62 drugs.

In-depth analyses of autophagy signaling and metabolomics indicate that SARS-28 CoV-2 reduces glycolysis and protein translation by limiting activation of AMP-protein activated kinase 29 (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Infection also downregulates 30 autophagy-inducing spermidine, and facilitates AKT1/SKP2-dependent degradation of autophagy-31 initiating Beclin-1 (BECN1).

At 24 and 48 hours, (vehicle-or) BafA1-treated and SARS-CoV-2 83 infected cells showed equally limited autophagic flux(Figures 1a-b). A reduction of autophagic flux 84 was further corroborated by elevated levels of the autophagy receptor SQSTM1/P62 in SARS-CoV-2-85 infected cells(Figures 1c-d). Furthermore, we used a well-established autophagy reporter plasmid, 86 ptfLC3, to assess lysosomal-autophagosomal fusion, a hallmark of autophagic flux (12). The number of 87 ALs (in red) in mRFP and EGFP dual-tagged LC3B-expressing and SARS-CoV-2 infected NCI-H1299 cells 88 was clearly reduced compared to mock-infected cells(Figures 1e-f), indicating virus-induced reduction 89 of AP and AL fusion. Quantification showed that the total number of ALs was reduced from a mean of 90 88 to 62 vesicles per cell, whereas the number of APs per cell was comparable (Mock = 56 vesicles/cell; 91 SARS-CoV-2 = 51 vesicles/cell). The ratio of APs to ALs shifted in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, indicating 92 strong AP accumulation (Mock= 0.707\u00b10.053; SARS-CoV-2= 0.921 \u00b1 0.058) (Figure 1e). Taken together, 93 SARS-CoV-2 strongly reduced the autophagic flux in both cell lines, in a fashion similar to MERSof autophagy is a cumulative result of multiple protein and signaling cascades that are 96 involved in the energy and nutrient sensing of cells (7, 11). The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 97 and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase are in continuous crosstalk with 98 glucose and protein homeostasis respectively (13, 14). We monitored key proteins of the AMPK and 99 mTORC1 pathways and their regulation/degradation by Western blot analyses after infection with 100 SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2). SARS-CoV-2 infection influenced most of the analyzed components of the 101 AMPK/mTORC1 pathway. Phosphorylated, active forms of AMPK, AMPK substrates (LXRXX), AMPK 102 downstream targets (TSC2 and ULK1), and mTORC1 were downregulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, 103 suggesting a virus-induced reduction of cellular glycolysis, protein translation, and cell growth. In 104 addition, we found increased levels of phosphorylated AKT1, which activates the negative regulator of 105 BECN1, SKP2 (10). Low BECN1 levels and subsequently reduced ATG14 phosphorylation and 106 oligomerization (Figure 2, lower left panel) explain the lack of fusion of APs with lysosomes observed 107 in Figure 1e-f as ATG14 oligomers facilitate fusion via SNARE-proteins, SNAP29 and STX17 (10). ubiquitous infection of cells (Figure 3). The metabolite profiles were analyzed by 113 multivariate principal component analysis (PCA), an unsupervised statistical method suitable for 114 analyzing and classifying metabolomics datasets (15). The profiles clearly separated into SARS-CoV-2 115 and control group (Figure S2a). Altogether, the levels of 25 metabolites were significantly altered by 116 SARS-CoV-2 infection (SupplementaryTable 1). We performed pathway analyses in order to gain 117 insights into the cellular and mechanistic consequences of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We retrieved eight 118 affected pathways using the significantly altered metabolites fromSupplementary Table 1 (Figure 3a).119 Glutathione (GSH) metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis had the 120 most pronounced changes. Metabolites of the butanoate metabolism as well as the alanine, aspartate 121 and glutamate metabolism were also elevated. In contrast, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glutamine 122 and glutamate metabolism, and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism were reduced by SARS-CoV-123 2. The volcano plot visualizes the metabolites with large magnitude fold changes. We identified seven 124 altered metabolites: Cys-glycine, N-acetylputrescine, adenosine, putrescine, homocysteine and 125 cysteine levels were elevated whereas fructose-6P was strongly depleted (Figure 3b). Putative links 126 between the different pathways during SARS-CoV-2 infection are shown in Figure 3c. We observed 127 elevated ATP levels that might facilitate energy-dependent processes such as virus replication and 128 entry (Figure 3c, blue). High lactic acid and low fructose-6P levels indicate exhaustive glycolysis activity 129 (Figure 3c, green). Decreased levels of TCA metabolites (Figure 3c, purple) further support a switch 130 from (mitochondria-dependent) oxidative phosphorylation to lactic acid fermentation, to provide 131 NAD+ for glycolytic ATP production. Consequently, we observed a reduced AMP/ATP ratio (Figure 3c, 132 blue) limiting AMPK activation (16) and subsequently autophagy (see Figure 2). Limited autophagy 133 might prevent degradation of viral products and might enhance the availability of non-autophagic 134 membrane material to generate double-membrane vesicles that are generated during coronavirus 135 replication(17, 18). Interestingly, despite reduction of protein-degrading autophagy, we observed 136 strong upregulation of amino acids, especially those linked to glutathione metabolism, which is 137 responsible for elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This might be essential to limit the 138 mitochondrion-derived ROS that are generated during excessive ATP production (19) and should be 139 investigated in future studies. Further investigations should also clarify why the observed upregulated 140 amino acid levels do not activate mTORC1 (seeFigure 2, pmTOR S2448 /mTOR and pULK1 S757 /ULK1).141However, spatially distinct pools of mTORC1 proteins might serve as an explanation (20).",

Cell viability tests were performed for inhibitors and drugs to 152 exclude toxicity (Figure S3a). VeroFM cells were infected with an MOI of 0.0005 and treated 1 hour 153 post infection with different concentrations of each substance according to the manual instructions or 154 previous publications. Virus growth was monitored by real-time RT-PCR in cell culture supernatants 24 155 and 48 hours post infection (Figure S3b-d). DFMO (500 \u00b5M) blocks ornithine-to-putrescine synthesis 156 (24) and was previously described as an RNA virus inhibitor upon pretreatment (25) but had minor 157 effects on SARS-CoV-2 growth upon post-treatment, whereas spermidine (100 \u00b5M) and spermine (100 158 \u00b5M) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation by up to 66% (Figure 4a, upper left panel, Figure S3b,c). AICAR 159 (25 \u00b5M), a known AMPK activator (26), slightly induced virus growth at 24 hours post infection (Figure 160 4a, upper right panel), which seems contradictory, as AMPK is downregulated upon SARS-CoV-2 161 infection (see Figure 2), but could be explained by AMPK-induced mTORC1 inhibition or AMPK-162 unrelated functions of AICAR (27). Alternatively, AICAR-dependent AMPK activation might be 163 insufficient to restore autophagic flux (see Figure 1). In addition, mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin (0.3 164 \u00b5M) clearly induced virus growth (Figure 4a, right panel, Figure S3d,e). Rapamycin, which has 165 previously been proposed as a treatment option for COVID-19 (28), possibly enhances the inhibitory 166 effects of SARS-CoV-2 on mTORC1 (see Figure 2) to reduce cellular protein translation, which would 167 serve as an additional explanation for the above-mentioned elevated amino acid levels (see Figure 3c, 168 orange). These results suggest that detailed molecular and functional analyses should be performed 169 for rapamycin before considering its use in clinical trials. The AKT1 inhibitor MK-2206 (1 \u00b5M), which is 170 currently being tested in a clinical phase 2 study against breast cancer (29), reduced SARS-CoV-2 171propagation up to 50%(Figure 4a, lower right, Figure S3d,e). AKT1 blocks mTORC1 inhibitor TSC2 (30) 172 and further supports the suggestion that up-regulation of mTORC1 components has antiviral effects.173As AKT1 inhibition results in BECN1 up-regulation and autophagy induction (10, 31), SARS-CoV-2 174 growth inhibition was expected. Direct blocking of the negative BECN1 regulator SPK2 by previously 175 described inhibitors SMIP004, SMIP004-7, valinomycin, and niclosamide (10) showed SARS-CoV-2 176 growth inhibition from 50 (SMIP004, SMIP004-7) to over 99% in case of valinomycin and niclosamide 177 the author/funder.

To assess the efficacy of pretreatment, VeroFM cells were preincubated with spermidine 186 (100 \u03bcM) or niclosamide (5 \u03bcM) for 24 hours. Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 using an MOI of187 0.05 without further compound treatment and virus growth was monitored in supernatants for 24 188 hours (Figure 4c, Figure S3f). In both cases, SARS-CoV-2 growth was reduced by 70%, suggesting that 189 both compounds exhibit long-lasting antiviral effects, and supporting further investigation into 190 prophylactic use of these compounds. For clinical use, half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 191 compounds should be in a non-toxic range and reach adequate plasma levels (35). The IC50 was 149 192 \u03bcM (R 2 = 0.71) for spermidine, 0.09 \u03bcM (R 2 = 0.95) for MK-2206, and 0.17 \u03bcM (R 2 = 0.63) for niclosamide, 193 based on plaque-forming infectious units (Figure 4c). Maximal inhibition of infectious virus at non-194 toxic concentrations was identified at 333.3 \u03bcM for spermidine (85%), at 3.7 \u03bcM for MK-2206 (88%), 195 and at 1.24 \u03bcM for niclosamide (>99%). Whereas plasma levels and pharmacokinetics of spermidine 196 are yet to be evaluated, peak plasma concentrations were 0,176 \u03bcg/ml (0.43 \u03bcM) for MK-2206 (36) 197 and 0.25 to 6.0 \u03bcg/ml (0.76-18.35 \u03bcM) for niclosamide (37), encouraging use in clinical trials. 198 In summary, our data show that highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 reprograms the metabolism of cells 199 and limits AMPK/mTORC1 activation and autophagy.
