Various forms of social distancing measures/testing practices were implemented in different countries/regions in order to stem the spread of the epidemic. Under those social distancing measures, rates of contact between individuals in different age groups are expected to significantly depart from the regular mixing patterns [2] . Under such circumstances, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the role of different age groups in propagating the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in different countries. While disease is most severe in older age groups, a sizeable share of COVID-19 related hospitalizations in Western countries belongs to individuals aged 20-55y [3] . A study of close contacts of COVID-19 cases in China [4] found comparable rates of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in different age groups. A better understanding is needed of the role that different age groups play in propagating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic during its current stage.",

The idea of this approach (a generalization of the original approach in [5, 6] ) is that age groups that have an elevated role in propagating an epidemic will have their share among all incident cases increase with time during the early states of the epidemic, particularly under containment efforts for which adherence varies between the different age groups. For example, if contact rates for one age group are less affected by social distancing measures compared to another age group due to lesser adherence, incidence of infection in the former age group will increase relative to the latter. This, in particular, can happen if the initial period of a study begins soon after the social distancing measures are implemented (which is the case for our study), with the shares of different age groups in incidence during the initial period being affected by the corresponding shares before the implementation of social distancing measures. Additionally, if a given country comprises several regions with different growth rates for their epidemics, the age group that drives the incidence of infection in regions with faster growing/larger epidemics will have its share among all incident cases in the country increase with time.",

We note that for a given age group, the ratio between the number of detected COVID-19 cases and incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (case-detection rate) in that age group may vary with time due to changes in healthcare-seeking behavior and other factors. To minimize the effect of relative changes, for the different age groups, in the case-detection rates with time, we restrict our analysis to individuals aged 10-49y only. We thus assume that for different age subgroups of that age group, the tendency to seek care or get tested does not change much over time relative to one another (e.g. there may be some increases with time in the likelihood of testing/seeking medical care for all individuals in the 10-49y age group, but not in specific age subgroups of that age group). We note that there is evidence that symptomatic older adults and younger children may be more likely to seek medical care/get tested compared to other age groups as the awareness about the epidemic increases with time, and those age groups are not included in this study.",

Our results, based on applying this method to data on COVID-19 cases in Germany provided by the Robert Koch Institute [7], suggest that individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) had their share in SARS-CoV-2 incidence increase with time compared to individuals aged 35-49y and children aged 10-14y. Some of those relative increases may stem from elevated mixing compared to other age groups related to lesser adherence to social distancing guidelines for individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y). Further work is needed to assess those issues in different countries.",

One limitation is that the ratio between the number of detected COVID-19 cases and incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (case-detection rate) may vary with time in each age group. We believe that it is unlikely that this phenomenon is more pronounced for individuals aged 15-34y compared to persons aged 35-49 or 10-14y, namely that increases in the likelihood of seeking medical care or the likelihood of being tested for individuals aged 15-34y are substantially larger compared to individuals aged 35-49y or 10-14y. Therefor, the observed temporal increases in the relative share of individuals aged 15-34y among detected COVID-19 cases in persons aged 10-49y should be indicative of the actual increase in the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y among SARS-CoV-2 infections in the German population aged 10-49y.",

Additionally, data on mixing patterns in different age groups during regular times [2] , as well as some evidence about the current social interactions of younger adults/older adolescents suggests that those age groups are expected to have the largest role in driving the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, which is indeed supported by our results.",
