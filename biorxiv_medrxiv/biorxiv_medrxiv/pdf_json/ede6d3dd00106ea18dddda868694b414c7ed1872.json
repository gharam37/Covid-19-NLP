The reproduction number for the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 was estimated to be 2.2 in Hubei Province, China, based on cases in December 2019 and January 2020.(1) Following one month of social distancing and lockdown, the reproduction number decreased to 1.6.(2) We sought to calculate the current reproduction number for each state in the United States.",

We found that the reproduction number for COVID-19 has declined in most states over the past two weeks which suggests that social isolation measures may be having a beneficial effect. However, most states still have reproduction numbers substantially higher than 1.0. That means it would be premature to relax restrictions and resume normal social and economic activities. Doing so now will result in an increase in the reproduction number and a surge of new cases. Examining changes in reproduction number over the coming weeks and months may help guide decisions to continue social restrictions and to monitor the impact of gradually relaxing such restrictions.",

In addition, the number of people tested has increased greatly in recent days as testing kits have become more available. This would be expected to increase COVID-19 diagnoses and therefore the reproduction number. It is encouraging that we found a reduction in reproduction number despite this increase in testing. Other limitations include the lack of United States data on serial intervals, daily reproduction numbers can be highly variable and the small numbers of cases in some states.",

We utilized serial interval data reported in China and truncated negative values and values greater than 20 days as unrealistic.(4) We identified the best function as a gamma distribution with a mean of 4.5 and a standard deviation of 4.3 days and calculated time dependent daily reproduction numbers over a 14 day interval using the approach proposed by Wallinga & Teunis with a Bayesian modification for real-time estimation.(4-6) All analyses were performed with R statistical software and R0 and projections packages.",
