To demonstrate the power of this assay, a 250 bp DNA target sequence matching a portion of the African swine fever virus (ASFV) genome is used and a detection limit of ~0.5 nM is achieved without target amplification using a simple portable ultraviolet flashlight. The positive samples are readily confirmed by visual inspection, completely avoiding the need for complicated devices and instruments.

To further confirm the MB-Qdots conjugation, the beads were washed 5 times followed by DNase I (EN0521, ThermoFisher Scientific) treatment to degrade the hybridized DNA strands. As shown in Fig. 2b , a distinct fluorescence peak was detected for the conjugation sample (red), while no signal was observed in the control sample (streptavidin-coated magnetic beads). The integrated signals of the fluorescence spectra (550-700 nm) were plotted (inset of Fig.2b) , where the conjugation sample shows ~2,000 counts, and is approximately 13 times higher than the control sample. In addition, for the conjugation sample, the bright pink fluoresence signal is easily observed by using a flashlight.",

Adding more magnetic beads does not decrease the fluorescence intensity, indicating that the saturated ratio of magnetic bead to linker probe A is ~4 \u00b5g: 1 pmoles. Next, we optimized the ratio of reporter probes B to Qdots, which is the key to eliminate the fluorescence background. One pmoles of Qdots were selected and the load of reporter probe B was varied from 0 to 80 pmoles. As shown in Fig. 3b , a ratio of 80:1 between reporter probe B and Qdots shows the lowest background and is used for nucleic acid detection. To determine the optimized hybridization condition of linker probe A and reporter probe B, Qdots with a load of 0.5 pmoles were pre-mixed with 40 pmoles of reporter probe B (ratio of 1: 80), and then allowed to hybridize with magnetic bead-linker probe A conjugation (ratio of 4 \u00b5g: 1 pmoles).

            "text": "Numerous Qdots are immobilized on the magnetic bead by the complementary hybridization of reporter probe and linker probe. As shown in Fig. 1c, Qdots exhibit higher fluorescence intensity than conventional organic fluorescein amidite (FAM) (excitation: 488 nm), making them ideal for instrumentfree visual detection. Fig. 1d further shows the workflow of our detection scheme: cleaved and uncleaved linker probes are immobilized on the magnetic beads, followed by the hybridization with Qdot reporter probe. Magnetic isolation separates unhybridized reporter probes, leaving probes in the eluate that are proportional to the starting target nucleic acid. Fluorescence measurement then can be performed with the illumination of an inexpensive and portable flashlight.",

On the other hand, the collected supernatants do not show any fluorescence signals without target input or with a mismatched target sequence. These results were then validated by using the custom designed fluorometer and are presented in Fig. 4b. The intensities of matched target DNA samples with concentrations of 0.5 nM, 0.75 nM, 1 nM, 2.5 nM, 10 nM, and 50 nM are significantly higher than the mismatched or blank samples. These results were further confirmed by TEM imaging. As shown in Fig. 4c, for blank and mismatched samples, Qdots with an average diameter of 17.5 nm were linked on the magnetic bead via linker probe A and reporter probe B hybridization. On the other hand, for samples containing target DNA, Qdots are not observed in the TEM image, indicating that the linker probes were denatured and left the Qdots suspended in the solution for detection.",
