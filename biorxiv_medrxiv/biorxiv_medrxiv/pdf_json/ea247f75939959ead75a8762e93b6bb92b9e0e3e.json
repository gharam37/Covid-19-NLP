Here, we describe the process of developing a SARS-Cov2 diagnostic workflow in a conventional academic Containment Level 2 (CL2) laboratory. Our outline includes simple SARS-Cov2 deactivation upon contact, the methods for a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) detecting SARS-Cov2, a description of process establishment and validation, and some considerations for establishing a similar workflow elsewhere. This was achieved under challenging circumstances through the collaborative efforts of scientists, clinical staff, and diagnostic staff to mitigate to the ongoing crisis. Within 14 days, we created a validated COVID-19 diagnostics service for healthcare workers in our local hospital. The described methods are not exhaustive, but we hope may offer support to other academic groups aiming to set up something comparable in a short time frame.",

As a result, national diagnostic services are stretched to and there is a need for alternative laboratory facilities to provide additional diagnostic capacity. The screening of asymptomatic individuals and healthcare workers (HCWs) will be key for controlling the epidemic and also to ensure HCW are a) working in safe conditions with functional personal protective equipment (PPE), b) not transmitting SARS-Cov2 to vulnerable patients on wards, and c) can return to work if they are not actively infected [3] . However, in almost all cases, embedding a rapid testing workflow for screening asymptomatic individuals and HCWs within the current hospital structure would add additional pressure upon an already overstretched diagnostic service.",

For example, the UK has recently initiated the establishment of national testing centres for HCWs; however, there is a need for guidance on how such systems be standardised or scaled. The expected turnaround times from sampling collection to results being reported back to the affected HCW is also a key issue. Whilst central screening facilities will ultimately be beneficial in curtailing the epidemic, smaller academic and non-academic laboratories can (and should) contribute to these efforts. Critically, local facilities (academic laboratories in proximity to or within healthcare facilities) can frequently provide a quicker turnaround time than larger remote facilities due to simpler sampling and shipping logistics or even overstretched, onsite diagnostic laboratories; current turnaround time is typically >48 hours from sample being taken to provision of result. Such delays can have a negative impact on healthcare provision, for example staffing levels may be strained due to HCWs isolating as a result of a respiratory illnesses other than COVID-19. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to establish local screening workflows for HCWs and those working in essential service industries.",

In the given circumstances, a robust diagnostic test for COVID-19 should be able to generate a result rapidly, but also maintain a high level of reproducibility, specificity, and sensitivity [5] . The test also needs to be conducted on an easily accessible clinical sample, such as a nose/mouth swab, urine, or blood. Such tests can be based upon a direct amplification assay for a component of the viral genome, a suitable biomarker or metabolic signature, or the measurement of an indicative acute antibody response. Given a paucity of reliable alternatives, a PCR based approach is currently the most suitable and scalable model, whilst providing an acceptable compromise between turnaround time and accuracy.",

Early indications for COVID-19 infections is that there are relatively high titres of virus in the respiratory tract, possibly in the gastrointestinal tract, but lower concentrations in blood [6] . Consequently, oral/nasal swabs are widely accepted as the optimal clinical sample for HCWs and others who are likely to have a higher occupational exposure risk to the virus through their work. These swabs need to be handled safely, so the use of a sampling method that inactivates the virus rapidly is essential to protect the sampler and those handling the sample, including couriers, and laboratory staff [7] . The availability and the expense of reagents required for an effective testing programme at a specific scale (e.g. hospital, company, or local community) is critical giving the ongoing demand for specific kits. Tests that require expensive mainstream reagents, or those in short supply, should be avoided where possible. PCR diagnostics are prone to issues with contamination and appropriate workflow and strict sample/reagent segregation needs to be adopted, which may be problematic in some setting. Methodologies and equipment are variable, but every attempt should be made to ensure the tests are performed using a standardised and validated test with appropriate controls. Lastly, the resulting data needs to be authenticated by a qualified individual and reported in a timely fashion through an existing and official reporting system, whilst at the same time ensuring patient confidentiality.",

The diagnostic laboratory provided access to their in-house method (designed by Martin Curran and Surendra Parmar) and provided a collection of anonymised SARS-Cov2 positive extractions (as determined by the same PCR method) and a cloned positive control. The required reagents were ordered and the QuantStudio machine calibrated to run the qRT-PCR. qRT-PCR was initially performed using existing positive samples and ten-fold dilutions of the cloned target gene (a conserved region with the ORF1 polyprotein). Upon amplification, we were able to replicate the positive signals from known positive samples (with comparable CT values of between 20 and 33) and generate a reproducible standard curve that could be used for all following amplifications and validations ( Figure 1a ). Additionally, during this process we validated the amplification process by the addition of a positive control; MS2 nucleic acid was added to all samples with the exception of the positive SARS-Cov2 control and the negative controls ( Figure 1b) .

This was potentially due to SARS-cov2 DNA that was being amplified inside the machine and causing all samples to have CT values ~32. Consistency in CT value suggested that the issue was at the amplification stage and not at the extraction or qRT-PCR preparation stage.",

The baseplate and optical plate were removed from the machine for deep cleaning. The baseplate was rinsed in 10% bleach, followed by MilliQ water, 95% ethanol, then water again.

To revalidate the machine, a plate of 20 mastermix plus water (negative controls) in any \"problem\" wells (to rule out the possibility of well-specific amplification/contamination) and additional wells scattered around the plate were assessed. Based on the location of the problem wells, contamination was often more severe at the edges of the plate, so these were also checked. The rest of the wells of the 96-well plate were filled with 10 \u00b5l of water only. The location of the \"problem\" wells suggested that there might have been a failed plate seal at some point, which may have released some DNA into the machine to amplify.

This places an enormous pressure on an already saturated system. The introduction of large screening services will play a huge role in tackling the epidemic in the UK and elsewhere but lacks some of the speed and flexibility that small on-site diagnostic laboratories can provide. We recognised the need to repurpose our laboratory for COVID-19 screening; this was initiated without request to provide some additional local capacity. Many academic facilities may be in a similar position but may be unsure about how to start proceedings and what regulations are in place. We suggest that groups establish the assay and processes so they can be prepared as the need arises. The route we describe here is not a scalable solution to the international lack of diagnostic testing, but a blueprint for what can be established is a standard academic research laboratory within 14 days. At the time of writing we have a full sample workflow from swabbing to diagnostic testing of HCWs at our healthcare facility, with the capacity of approximately 100 tests a day with a result provided within 24 hours. This number of tests can be expanded, but is dependent on maintaining enough extraction rooms, key staff, and of course key reagents. We sought to develop a test that works independently of kits from major suppliers, but there will potentially be issues with other resources as the crisis develops. The theoretical turnaround time is 4 hours, but this is dependent on integrating with occupational health facility and the diagnostic laboratory and ensuring there is a sustainable communication and enough staff to maintain the process.",
