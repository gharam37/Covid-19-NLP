Therefore, the ability to minimise the devastating consequences of the disease on people's lives and livelihoods relies on the implementation of effective preventative non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). NPIs include multiple public health measures designed to reduce viral transmission rates in a population by reducing the reproduction number (R 0 ); the average number of secondary cases each case generates. (4) (5) (6) NPIs directly influence the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the rate of spread, and the expected duration of the pandemic. However, several characteristics of the virus remain ambiguous or mostly unknown, (7) (8) such as the incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset), serial interval (the time between symptom onset of a primary and secondary case) the extent of asymptomatic cases, the possibility of pre-symptomatic infectiousness, the case fatality rate (CFR), and also the possible role of weather in transmission. Estimates for COVID-19 CFR range from 0.3-1%. (9) Asymptomatic or mild presentation comprises the bulk of the reported cases, which is an estimated at 80%. (10) Longitudinal viremia measurements from a small study (sample size of 16) , suggests that there are high enough viral loads to trigger pre-symptomatic infectiousness for 1-2 days before the onset of symptoms. (11) With the lack of clinical studies measuring viremia, the infectious period also remains largely unknown, with estimates ranging from few days to 10 days or more after the incubation period. (11) The complexity of the infection and recovery process, therefore, means that proper understanding of the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 within the local context is fundamental to combat the pandemic. Studies illustrating future trajectories of the disease are not only helpful to develop early warning systems, avoid overwhelming healthcare services and minimize morbidity and mortality from the disease, but also assist countries to evaluate the effects of interventions and the long-term consequences of the virus on peoples' livelihood. This is particularly true in Africa, where livelihoods are fragile, and previous epidemics, such as HIV/AIDS and, more recently, Ebola, have been known to exert enormous socioeconomic consequences. (12) (13) (14) In addition, in the face of a new pandemic in the region, the already overstretched healthcare systems that are struggling to deliver essential healthcare services such as immunization and HIV/AIDS treatment would be in further jeopardy and at risk of losing the gains achieved so far in disease control efforts. This study, using a robust methodology, provides spatial and temporal trajectories of COVID-19 for the entire Africa region. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such attempt and accounts for the local context and characteristics relevant to the epidemiology of the diseases in the region.",

The statistical diagnostic tests as well the patterns from the graphical analysis suggest that the predicative model sufficiently captures the observed data. As can be seen from the table, not only are the RMSE, the MAE and the Pseudo-R 2 consistent across samples, the error margins are also small. Hence, we have used the resulting model to forecast cumulative COVID-19 cases, estimate new infections and deaths from COVID-19 for each of the 47 African countries which have reported at least one case as of March 31, 2020. Table 1 presents cumulative COVID-19 cases and prevalence rates for Africa and its five sub-regions for the period April 1 to June 30 2020. By the end of April cumulated infection across the region will reach 2.5 million cases and will further increase to 16.2 million by June 30. During the same period, cumulative cases in the hardest hit sub-region in the African continent, Northern Africa, is predicted to increase from 1.3 million at the end of April to over 7.5 million by June 30. This is followed by Southern, Western, and Central Africa sub-regions. Throughout the forecast period, Eastern Africa is predicted to experience the lowest case load and prevalence rate in the continent throughout the forecast period. Note these estimates are highly uncertain; the 95% confidence intervals (CI) are shown in Table 1 below. Figure 1A shows spatial patterns of cumulative COVID-19 cases by June 30, 2020 for the African continent. In Northern Africa, the leading contributor to the burden of COVID-19 is Morocco. By the end of June, Morocco will have 4.5 million cumulative COVID-19 cases, and this is almost double the estimated number for Algeria, a country with the next highest burden, 2.8 by the end of June. In Southern Africa, South Africa and Swaziland are on the lead. By the end of June, these two countries are expected to have respectively around 2.6 million and 250 thousand cumulative COVID-19 cases. In the Western Africa sub-region, cumulative cases will be dominated by Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana, despite Nigeria having a larger population than both countries combined.",

(4-6, 8) Further, at the individual level, knowledge on the determinants of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality is limited to selected characteristics such as age and pre-existing conditions, and even then, they are drawn from scanty data. The association with community and population level characteristics is even more limited, hence largely speculative. In this context, the task of developing a multi-country covariate-based predictive model for COVID-19 in any country or region of the world, let alone Africa, is likely to be guided by what is feasible, and to the extent, the available data permits it. It also means that there is a need for constant revision of predictive models as new data becomes available. In our case, the work is further complicated because in Africa data on key covariates are either lacking or when they exist, they tend to be biased or derived from other global covariate-based modeling exercises. (21) (22) Despite this, we have made efforts to mitigate these limitations by curating data from various credible sources around the world and assessing them for consistency. In developing our model, we have used data sources from 193 countries globally and used statistical relationships to fill data gaps on covariates in the Africa region. Additionally, our model performance was assessed through rigorous out of sample calibration using k-fold cross-validation techniques and obtaining robust results. We have also restricted our forecast to the first few months (April-June) and refrained from a long-term projection exercise. Firstly, this is because we anticipate new and additional data to emerge in the short term that will lead to better and improved estimates. Secondly, where data is sparse, any longterm projection is more likely to be detached from reality and can easily become a wild guess and is therefore less useful for informing policy actions.

Our Among our key findings are that African countries that are relatively more urbanized and have a higher socio-demographic index (SDI) are projected to experience a faster growth of the epidemic, at least during the initial periods. To illustrate this trend, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, in the Northern African sub-region, which have a predominantly urban population, and are in close proximity to the high burden European countries, are projected to experience a higher incidence of COVID-19 infections in comparison to their neighbors. In the Southern Africa sub-region, South Africa, which has a proportionately higher urban population and greater international connectivity, is also projected to lead the rest of the pack in terms of new infections rates. In the Eastern Africa sub-region, Kenya, which is relatively more urbanized has a higher per capita incidence rate in comparison to other countries within the sub-region. However, it is noted that some of these countries also have higher living standards and better health system than most countries in the region. Hence the high prevalence rates and estimated deaths in these countries may in part reflect their greater ability to detect and confirm COVID-19 cases.",

Similar trends are observed in Burundi and Tanzania in the Eastern Africa region. However, as the epidemic grows many of these countries are projected to experience increases in cumulative infections that are likely to overwhelm their health system. Overall, these trends are consistent with other regions of the world, where since the onset of this pandemic, it has been clear that higher connectivity, particularly through air traffic, and higher population densities are key drivers in the introduction and growth of the epidemic. (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) The impact of population density is clearly illustrated by the projected new infections of COVID-19 in places like Djibouti and Rwanda. To compound this, close to 90% of urban settlements in Africa are comprised of informal settlements, most of which are overcrowded and lack basic amenities such as clean water and sanitation which are critical prevention measures for COVID-19. (40) (41) (42) Moreover, 60% of jobs in urban areas are in the informal economy, (43) and if African countries were to implement stringent lockdowns these livelihoods would be largely affected and could lead to significant socioeconomic consequences. For instance, those that lose their jobs are likely to move back to their homes in rural areas, where many of the elderly population reside, hence putting them at risk. Similarly, as the economy slows down in several countries due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some sections of migrant workers from African countries might be forced to return to their home countries and hence further complicating the dynamics of the pandemic.",

It is crucial to balance interventions geared towards preventing the spread of the epidemic with the need to maintaining livelihoods and social cohesion.

Therefore, the already overstretched healthcare systems in Africa need to anticipate and prepare to handle an increased number of patients as a consequence of the pandemic, on top of the other common disease conditions that are prevalent in the region. Unfortunately, this is a lesson Africa has already had to learn from the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. It is estimated there were an additional 11,000 deaths from malaria, HIV/AIDS and TB across Sierra-Leone, Guinea and Liberia, (44) a 60% decrease in the number of children treated for diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (45) and a 38% increase in maternal mortality in Guinea and a 111% increase in Liberia. (46) (47) Understanding the factors that accelerate and those that mitigate the spread and mortality related to COVID-19, while accounting for local realities, is fundamental for sound public health measures to tackle the pandemic. In fact, lessons from HIV/AIDS programming have taught us that highly effective health interventions fail if the local context is not recognized. Therefore, decision makers in Africa must realize that one size does not fit all and could lead to disastrous outcomes.

It is therefore important that governments include marginalized communities, such as refugees, migrants and internally displaced populations (IDPs) in their policies and actions. Across Africa, approximately 12.3 million people remain forcibly displaced, including 8.1 million internally displaced people and 4.2 million refugees. (55) Moreover, Sub-Saharan Africa alone hosts more than 26% of the world's refugee population. (56) (57) These populations are likely to face a different set of constraints that restricts their ability to prevent themselves from getting infected and accessing health care. The fact that they also live in under difficult circumstances means that governments across the region should maintain critical supply corridors for humanitarian assistance and address the needs of the most vulnerable within their borders. In the longer term this pandemic should also be a call for African governments to further strengthen engagement with international humanitarian actors in order to foster strong partnership building on local capacities. Within this supra-national context, the issue of 'livelihood corridor' also needs to be looked at carefully and more broadly, given that AfCFTA (the African Continental Free Trade Agreement) which is expected to govern trade and flow of goods and services in the region will come into effect on July 1 2020 (African Union 2020). Hence, current and planned NPIs in the region need to consider such regional initiatives to ensure that responses to the pandemic at country and regional level are coherent and able to balance saving the lives and livelihood of the people of the African continent.",
