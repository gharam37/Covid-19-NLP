But those models rely on a detailed knowledge of the population under study which is not easy to replicate for many countries which have not been the subject of similar studies. To fill this gap and to provide an easy to use tool for policy-makers in different countries/regions/cities, in this manuscript, a known stratified epidemiological model is used to predict the spread of COVID-19 in an uncontained population. In the model, the population is divided into different age-groups, as will be explained shortly. Hence, the model can be used to quantify the effects of various containment policies that affect different age-groups differently. The parameters of the model are estimated based on available data on the early stages of the progress of COVID-19 in China. Although the parameters of the model are estimated based on the data collected from China, as we will see in the following, the structure of the model allows us to adapt these parameters for any other country or any population with a known age structure.",

In such models, the population is divided into compartments that capture different stages in the progress of that disease. The three compartments are Susceptible, S, which includes those who are healthy and can be infected with the virus; Infectious, I, which includes those who are infected and can transmit the disease; and Removed, R, which includes those who were Infectious but are not any more, because they recovered or because they died. This choice is guided by the common consensus among immunologists that people have short-term immunity to seasonal coronaviruses. For the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is already shown to be the case for Macaque monkeys in [5] and for humans in [4] . Although there has been a report of a patient recovered from COVID-19 to be infected again [11] , which if proved to be a common phenomenon, then SIS models would be more suitable for COVID-19. But in the absence of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, assuming short-term immunity for COVID-19 seems to be a reasonable choice. Although in the interest of completeness, the mathematical descriptions for both SIS and SIR models are presented in Section S.1.",

The choice of how to group the population is completely arbitrary from a theoretical perspective. But from a practical point of view, such a choice should be informed by the characteristics of the disease and also the availability of the relevant data used to tune the parameters of the model. And in that regard, a very good choice for modelling the spread of COVID-19 is to divide the population into age groups. More specifically, the population in each compartment S, I and R is divided into nine age groups 0-10, 10-20, ..., 70-80 and 80+. And the subsequent model is a set of 3\u00d79 nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with some unknown parameters which we should estimate based on the known characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These parameters are transfer rates, and contact rates. Transfer rate, represented with \u03b3 i for each of the age-groups i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 9, is the rate at which individuals leave the Infectious compartment and is relatively easy to estimate. It depends on the average time period between the moment an individual becomes Infectious and the moment that the individuals are considered cured or die. There are some estimates for this time period, as reported in [2] . I have assumed this time-period for COVID-19 to be 20 days. Considering one day to be the unit of time, and assuming this time-period is on average the same for all age groups, then \u03b3 i = 0.05 for i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 9.",

The method uses an optimisation scheme to achieve this goal. The optimisation scheme is based on two distinct but important sets of data on the spread of COVID-19. One is the estimate for basic reproduction number, R 0 , for COVID-19 in the early stages of the spread of the virus. There are various estimates for that parameter, but the one reported in [15] , which is R 0 = 2.28 is used in this manuscript. A few other groups have also reported values very close to that [2] . The other piece of information is coming from [1] , which shows the relative distribution of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in each age-group in China as of February 11th, as shown in SI Section S.2. Up until two weeks before this date, Chinese authorities did not impose any meaningful containment strategies and the virus was spreading in an uncontained population. Hence we can assume to most part these numbers are the results of the uncontained spread of the virus. But what makes the adopted optimisation scheme so effective is that it relies on the ratio of confirmed cases in age-groups, not their absolute values. The advantage of this choice is that it makes the resulting model quite insensitive to the underlying assumptions in the optimisation scheme. The other advantage is that relying on the absolute numbers of confirmed cases can make the methodology vulnerable to deliberate or non-deliberate errors that might have occurred in the reported data. But assuming similar probabilities of occurrences of such errors in different agegroups, the ratio between these values would be less affected.",

In all the figures presented in this manuscript, I have assumed 1 in 10,000 in each age group is Infectious, and the Removed population is 0 in Day 1. For a country of 10 million, that amounts to 1,000 Infectious in total. We should be cautious in using a model based on a system of continuous ODEs for numbers lower than that. It should be noted that the peak values in Figures 1.1 and 1.2 are barely affected by the choice of initial conditions. But that is not true for the time it takes to reach the peak values. Hence, in order to predict the day in which the number of Infectious reaches the peak value, we should have a reasonable estimate of the initial conditions. But given the fact that usually in early stages of the spread of the virus, numbers usually remain hidden from authorities, initial conditions are almost impossible to guess. But the good news is that having a good estimate of the numbers of Infectious and Removed ratios in the age groups, at any moment in time, not necessarily the early stages of the spread of the disease, allows us to find the initial conditions that will result in that specific solution in that specific instance in time, and from there, we can predict the time to reach the peak value of the Infectious ratio. 4 .

This policy will decrease the eventual Removed ratio (which is the ratio of the population which has been Infectious at any time during the time period of interest) by more than 20%. To see how this huge decrease has happened, we should have a look at the break-down of the model outputs in age-groups, as shown in Figure  2 .3. As can be seen, this policy has decreased the Removed ratios in the first two age groups to almost 0, but its effects tend to decrease for other age groups, to the extent that it is almost non-existent for 70-80 and 80+ age groups. Added to that the fact that 17.4% of the Iranian population is in 0 \u2212 10 age range and 13.9% in 10\u221220, we can see why this policy has decreased aggregate numbers of the Removed compartment so much. But we can also see that this policy has less and less effect on the ratio of Removed compartment in older age-groups who are more vulnerable to COVID-19. Hence this policy will have a minimal effect on the mortality rate and the number of patients that need support care in hospitals. Interestingly enough, the first policy that the Iranian government imposed was shutting down schools and universities. At the time of writing this text, offices and companies are ordered to continue their normal operations, after a short break during the Persian new year holidays, while schools are kept closed, and while there is no official decree to keep the elderly at home. A policy that the model show is quite ineffective. Table 2 also shows the basic reproduction number, R 0 , for each policies. As can be seen in Figure  2 .1, and as it is well-known in epidemiology, when R 0 < 1, the disease starts to disappear from the population. But as importantly, bringing the ratio of the Infectious population down to a small enough ratio of the total population can take months, even if we impose a total lock-down strategy (the exact time depends on the ratio of Infectious when we start the policy). And maintaining such a strategy might not be feasible in many countries with a more fragile economy. In the next section, we will see what happens if we switch between different strategies as a long-term plan. Table 2 3",

Without such policies, Iran, or any other society for that matter, will face a humanitarian disaster, and the whole purpose of this report is to highlight this imminent threat. But let's assume that there is an immediate containment policy in place and the ratio of the Infectious population starts to drop. As we saw, bringing down the ratio of Infectious to a level that can be considered small enough for eradicating the disease from the population can take months. And the economy might collapse if such a stringent strategy imposed for such a time-period. Apart from that, even if the virus is eradicated in one country, in our globalised and connected world there is always the possibility that the virus is re-introduced from other countries who have not imposed containment strategies. So, the natural question is, what policy is suitable as a long-term strategy?",

To find the answer to that, we need to run an optimisation scheme to find the coefficients for con-tact rates in each age group which would bring R 0 from the original estimated 2.28 for the spread of COVID-19 in an uncontained population, to around 1.00. In the simplest case, when we decide to impose a uniform policy to all age groups, the coefficient is 0.4386 or 43.86%. It means that if everybody brings down their direct contacts with other individuals to 44% of what it was in the normal times in Iran, the ratio of Infectious would stay the same or decrease at a slow pace. Please note that this value applies to the age structure of Iran and is different for other countries. This value is calculated using the same optimisation algorithm as explained in SI Section S.2, but with a different objective function. Now let's see how these values change if we want to impose different policies for each age group. To make it realistic, I have assumed a different policy for people under 20, between 20 and 70, as the workforce in the society, and above 70. And let's assume the minimum feasible coefficient is 10% for all age groups. Running the optimisation scheme again, we get values of [15.76%, 14.39%, 99.92%] for the three age brackets, 0-20, 20-70, and 70+. But bringing down the interactions of the working force to 14% of the normal level while not enforcing any changes to the contacts of the elderly does not seem like a sound policy. Let's set a lower threshold of 40% to the interactions of the working force and keep it at 10% for the other two age ranges. Also, let's set an upper limit of 20% on the interactions of 70-80 and 80+ age groups, meaning we ask them to self-isolate until further notice, and an upper limit of 50% for people in 0-20 age-bracket. The optimised coefficients are now [29.84%, 60.74%, 10.15%]. So, under such a policy, if kids and teenagers' interactions are brought down to around 30%, adults to 61% and elderly to 10%, number of Infectious would stay more or less the same for a long period of time.",

To clarify, let's assume we impose a lock-down strategy for 30 days, and then remove the regulations for 30 days to ease the economic burden, and continue the switching for a few times. Figures 3.1 and 3.2 shows how the spread of the virus changes. As can be seen, the ratio of Infectious follows a seasaw pattern and in general decreases. Given that we switch to the uncontained policy, it is no surprise that the decrease does not happen as fast as the continuous lock-down policy. Nonetheless, we have managed to stop the Infectious ratio to reach its potential peak value and ease the burden on the healthcare system in the most critical time. Now let's add the R 0 = 1.0 policy to the mix. This time we switch between uncontained, lockdown and R 0 = 1.0 policies. Figures 3.3 and 3.4 show how Infectious and Removed ratios change under such a policy. Since this time there are 60 and not 30 days between uncontained periods, we see a more significant decrease in the Infectious ratio. But that means more people in the population remain susceptible, and if we stop the containment strategy too early, the Infectious ratios bounce back to a greater degree compared to the previous case.",

            "text": "The output of the model is the ratio of Infectious and Removed population in each age-group. The Removed population includes those who have been Infectious and then recovered or died. The main advantage of the model is that it needs no a priori knowledge of the interactions between individuals in a population, or how the virus affects each agegroup. The contact rates are estimated based on the available data on the spread of COVID-19. The model itself is a set of nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), hence simulating various containment policies in different time frames does need any special computational power. But the methodology has some shortcomings that we should keep in mind while interpreting the results. The method assumes the virus affects individuals (of the same age) in different countries similarly. If it is the case that the differences in genetic backgrounds or vaccination histories in different countries can affect the infection rate, such differences would be lost in this model. Also, it is an implicit assumption in the model that the general interactions between people in different coun- tries and societies are in general similar to each other. To clarify the point, if, for example, people older than 70 years in one country live with or have more contacts with the next generations, and in another country, they live in isolation or in nursing homes, then such differences in contacts between age groups are lost in the model. Another issue we should keep in mind relates to the test dataset used in this paper, which was the number of confirmed cases in China in each age-group as of February 11th, and from that, we calculated the desired ratios between the states of the model. And my understanding is that these confirmed COVID-19 cases has been mostly those who have developed symptoms. Hence, the implicit assumption is that the ratio of symptomatic to total number of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same for all age groups. If this assumption is proven to be wrong, then the symptomatic to total infected ratio should also be incorporated in calculating the desired ratios between the states of the models. The method can be extended in various directions to make the results even more useful. We can, for example, divide each age-group into subgroups based on their vulnerability to the virus, or based on the relative amount of interactions with other individuals in the population. For example, we can divide the population in each group to those with normal levels of contacts, and two sub-groups with one order of magnitude less or more contacts with other members of the populace. Even a rough estimate of the relative numbers of these three subgroups in each age group can give us more insight into more effective ways to contain the spread of the virus with less social and economic impact. The compartmental model can be extended if necessary. For example, we can add compartment E to include latent periods, if it is shown such a time-period is significant in COVID-19. Also, in this manuscript, I have assumed a simultaneous introduction of the virus to different cities and regions in a country, which is not always a realistic choice. Given the fact that nowadays the population structure in different cities/regions in almost every country is known, we can use the model to describe the spread of the virus for each region or city, and then, assuming in and out-flow traffic to each city is known, consider them as exogenous inputs to our system of ODEs. That would allow us to consider time-lags that might exist in the spread of COVID-19 to different parts of a country. But even as it is, this model with its estimated parameters can be a useful tool for different policy-makers in different countries.",

Later on, we will see that the results are robust with respect to the choices of initial conditions and exact value of t g . I have also set constrained for the minimum and maximum of the elements of matrix B to be 0.0001 and 0.1 to avoid solutions with anomalous values. Now that all the required parameters are set, we can solve the optimisation problem to find a B opt . In order to solve the optimisation problem, I have used sqp algorithm in globalsearch function in Global Optimisation Toolbox in Matlab c . Optimisation is done in two steps, in the first step, initial values for matrix B are chosen randomly from a uniform distribution. When the optimisation algorithm converges to a solution, the optimisation procedure is repeated, this time with the optimum value obtained in the first step as the initial values. The objective function in the optimisation scheme is the weighted sum of two terms. One is the 2-norm of the difference between the ratio of trajectories of an SIS or SIR model at time t g with initial condition x 0 with the desired ratio extracted from Table 3 . The second term is the difference between \u03c1(\u2212D \u22121 B) and the desired basic reproduction number of R 0 = 2.28. The second term is given a weight big enough so each term is not obscured by the other during the optimisation steps.",

The maximum relative error over all elements of x(t g ) and all values of t g was 0.019. In other words, if the initial guess of t g = 75 days was wrong and the spread of the disease started any time from 95 days to 55 days before the Feb. 11th date, the values we obtained\u03b2 i,j would lead to a ratio between states that match the desired ratios with a maximum error of 0.019 in all age groups.

As a reminder, to solve the optimisation problem, I assumed x 0 is 0 everywhere except its 4th element (corresponding to the age group 40-50) which is set to 1e-4. Note that this value represents the ratio of the population of infective in that age group to the total population in that age group. So, if the age group [40-50] includes millions of individuals, which is a reasonable assumption for the regions of China which were reported to be affected by COVID-19 as of Feb 11th. To test the sensitivity to x 0 , in the first step, I assumed that instead of [40 \u2212 50] age-group, one other age group among [20, 30] , [30, 40] , and [50,60] has an initial condition of 1e-4 while others are 0. For the SIS case, the total relative error over all such cases was 0.051. I then assumed all four age groups from 20 to 60, which are the likely age-groups that might frequent a wet market, have a value of 1e-4 while others are 0, and the maximum error was 0.012, which is even less than the previous case, and I find peculiar. To make the sensitivity analysis even more comprehensive, I have done the same procedure for initial values being of an order of magnitude smaller than what we have assumed so far, it means 1e-5. Once assuming just one age group in [20, 30] , [30, 40] , [40, 50] , [50,60] has such a value, and then all of them together. When the initial condition was set to 1e-5 for just one of the four age groups between 20 and 60 years, the maximum error in these two cases was 0.050. When the initial condition was set to 1e-5 in all four of them the maximum error becomes 0.008.",
