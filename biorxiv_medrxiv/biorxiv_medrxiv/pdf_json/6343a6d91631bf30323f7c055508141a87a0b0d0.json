            "text": "The outbreak of coronavirus diseases has rabidly spread all over the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that coronavirus COVID-19 is an international pandemic. The Real-Time Reverse transcription-polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) has a low positive and sensitivity rate in the early stage of COVID-19. As a result, the Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is used for diagnosing. COVID-19 has different key signs on a CT scan differ from other viral pneumonia. These signs include ground-glass opacities, consolidations, and crazy paving. In this paper, an Artificial Intelligence-inspired Model for COVID-19 Diagnosis and Prediction for Patient Response to Treatment (AIMDP) is proposed. AIMDP model has two main functions reflected in two proposed modules, namely, the Diagnosis Module (DM) and Prediction Module (PM). The Diagnosis Module (DM) is proposed for early and accurately detecting the patients with COVID-19 and distinguish it from other viral pneumonias using COVID-19 signs obtained from CT scans. The DM model, uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a Deep learning technique for segmentation, can process hundreds of CT images in seconds to speed up diagnosis of COVID-19 and contribute in its containment. In addition, some countries haven't the ability to provide all patients with the treatment and intensive care services, so it will be mandatory to give treatment to only responding patients. In this context, the Prediction Module (PM) is proposed for predicting the ability of the patient to respond to treatment based on different factors e.g. age, infection stage, respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and the treatment regimens. PM implement the Whale Optimization Algorithm for selecting the most relevant patient's features. The experimental results show promising performance for the proposed diagnosing and prediction modules, using a dataset with hundreds of real data and CT images.",

To accurately detect the signs of COVID-19 in CT images, a Feature Selection phased bases on Whale Optimization Algorithm (FSWOA) is proposed for selecting the most relevant patient's features. The most common signs for COVID 19, detected on CT scans are the Ground Glass Opacities (\u1e20\u1e20\u1ecc), that represent tiny air sacs (alveoli) filling with fluid and turning a shade of grey in CT scan. In severe infections and more advanced infections, more fluid will be occurring in lobes of the lungs, so the ground glass opacities will progress to Solid White Consolidation(\u1e68\u1e80\u1e08) sign. However, the Crazy Paving Pattern(\u1e08\u1e54\u1e54) swelling due the swelling in interstitial space along the walls of the lungs that makes the wall looks thicker like the white lines against the hazy ground glass background grey. The \u1e20\u1e20\u1ecc is usually the first sign of COVID19, and followed later by one or both of the other signs. Moreover, some countries haven't the ability to provide all patients with the treatment and intensive care service, it will be mandatory to give treatment to only responding patients. In this context, the Prediction Module (PM) is proposed for predicting the ability of the patient to respond to treatment based on different factors e.g. age, infection stage, respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and the treatment regimens. PM implement the Whale Optimization algorithm for selecting the most relevant patient's features. The experimental results show promising performance for the proposed diagnosing and prediction modules, using a dataset with hundreds of real data and CT images.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 shows the recent COVID-19 diagnosing models proposed, and a background of WOA is introduced. Section 3 demonstrates the proposed Artificial Intelligence-inspired Model for COVID-19, the Diagnosis (DM) and the Prediction Module (PM) are also discussed in details. The performance of AIMDP is evaluated in section 4 showing the effect of implementing FSWOA and using CNNs as a deep learning technique.

That means, the chest CT scan images can be sensitive but not specific for COVID19. For this reason, in the diagnosing and classification phase of AIMDP, further evaluation from lab tests (RT-PCR and CBC) are used to exclude other causes and accurately diagnosis COVID-19, and doesn't only depend on CT images for diagnosing Finally, AIMDP has a prediction phase that gives a probability of patient ability to respond to the COVID-19 treatment based on different inputs given for the patient like his age, infection stage, respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and the treatment regimens. This predicted value is given to the doctors that make a decision to provide the patient with treatment and intensive care services. This will help the doctors to save the resources of endemic countries, that have no enough resources, and only give the treatment to the responding patients.",

But, the algorithm worked in a black-box manner when diagnosing COVID-19, since the algorithm was based on deep learning and its explain ability was still at an early stage. COVNET [10] developed a framework to detect COVID-19 using chest CT and evaluate its performances. The authors proposed a three-dimensional deep learning framework to detect COVID-19 using chest CT.

Jiang et al [12] proposed established an early screening model to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from Influenza-A viral pneumonia and healthy cases with pulmonary CT images using deep learning techniques. The authors used multiple CNN models to classify CT image datasets and calculate the infection probability of COVID-19. The findings might greatly assist in the early screening of patients with COVID-19 by deep learning technologies.

A detailed descriptions of the whales' behaviours can be found in [16] . The feature selection phase in AIMDP use the WOA algorithm to select the most optimal relevant features, from the detailed patient information, to distinguish COVID 19 disease from different vial phonemes. The FS phase consists of five modules: Population initialization, Fitness Function, Encircle Prey, Bubble-Net Attacking Method Applier and Termination Module. In the Population initialization module, a number of search agents (whales) is randomly initialized, each whale represents a subset of features, to target the most relevant features (Preys). The appropriate representation of the feature/ patient list will help searching for the optimum solution and optimize the accuracy of diagnosing COVID19 disease. In the fitness function module, these agents(features) are converted into possible solutions for a given fitness function and initial generation of WOA parameters are set. Then for each solution, a fitness function will be evaluated for this solution. WOA uses fitness function that selects the minimal set of features for a patient achieving the best accuracy in diagnosing the virus. The most common CT finding in COVID-19 is the Ground Glass Opacities (\u1e20\u1e20\u1ecc) They represent tiny air sacs (alveoli) filling with fluid and turning a shade of grey in",

The tested classifiers are: SVM, Naive Bayes (NB), and Discriminant Analysis (DA) to test the performance with different perspectives. In the proposed model, the FSWOA phase provides the classifier with number of whales, each whale signifies a group of features \"1\" means that the feature is selected and \"0\" means not selected. Thus, WOA search to find the most relevant set of features that achieves the highest accuracy with either SVM, NB or DA classifier and the fitness function is utilized. The outcome of the classification is estimated based on the values of optimum features obtained from CT scan. And if the case is suspected (not confirmed) as a COVID-19 case, then further lab evaluations must be considered for accurate classification. The classification phase main goal is to differentiate COVID-19 patient from other infections. After classifying the data, the model is trained and validated in this layer.

These finding usually appear in multiple lobes in both lungs and outer periphery of the lungs. In mild and recovery cases of COVID19, the sings can be isolated to be in just one lobe.

This fact is emphasized by the high value of the AUC (0.9957). A Sensitivity score of the COVID of 96.27% indicates the portion of the COVID that is predicted correctly. Likewise, a Specificity score of 97.6% indicates the portion of the Non COVID sample that is predicted correctly, (447 out of 458).

When it comes to the performance of the NB classifier, it is seen that the F-score value is lower than that of the G-mean; however, both are relatively high (above 95.63 %) indicating the goodness of the performance. A high AUC value of 0.9857 confirms an effectiveness of performance. A sensitivity of 97.51% and 95.29 % for the COVID and Non COVID, respectively, indicate that the NB predicts the COVID class more effectively than Non COVID (for this dataset), the contrary of the SVM.

Accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 suspected cases plays an essential role in its containment. An Artificial Intelligence-inspired Model for COVID-19 Diagnosis and Prediction for Patient Response to Treatment (AIMDP) is presented. Different AI techniques have been utilized in this model. CNNs is used as a deep learning technique for segmenting the CT images. WOA algorithm is used in the Feature selection phase to select the minimum set of relevant features of diagnosing COVID-19 to optimize the results obtained. An intelligent classifier selector is implemented to select, from three different classifiers, the most appropriate classifier based on the classification error obtained for each case. An automatic diagnosing phase is implemented to accurately distinguish COVID-19 from other viral pneumonias cases, using CT scan images with the most relevant signs of CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

This will lead to saving number of resources and efforts by providing the treatment to non-responding patients. And will help decision makers to search for new treatment for non-responders and give more chance to save the responding cases with appropriate treatment. Number of experiments were performed to validate AIMDP performance. The obtained results proved the promising performance of AIMDP in diagnosing and predicting COVID-19 when compared to recent diagnosing and predicting models. AIMDP achieves high AUC and PPV, and low NPV and execution time, compared to others. As a future work, a plan is made to detect the severity degree of COVID-19 cases to provide appropriate treatment and isolation. Moreover, we plan to collect additional CT scans from different centres to evaluate its performance.",
