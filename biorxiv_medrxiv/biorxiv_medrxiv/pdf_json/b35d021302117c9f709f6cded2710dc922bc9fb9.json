Between suppression 175 implementation and the peak number of reported cases, the number of active cases in Hubei 176 increased by a factor 39, while in other provinces it increased by a factor of 9.5 with 177 considerable variation between provinces (range: 6.2 in Hainan and Chongqing to 20.4 in 178 Heilongjiang). If a 6-day reporting delay is accounted for in the estimate of the factor increase 179 from the start of measures to the peak, then this multiplication factor is diminished to a value 180 of 9.5 for Hubei and an average of 2.6 for the other provinces. The daily death rate of the 181 active sick people was 0.34 percent per day for Hubei, much higher than in other provinces 182 (on average 0.05 percent per day, ranging between 0 in Jiangsu Province (see also Sun, Qiu 183 (25)) and 0.18 percent per day in Hainan Province, Appendix 3), which indicates that on the 184 faster than the rate of decline during the tapering out of the epidemic (Appendix A1). Thus, 210 the logistic underestimates both the early relative growth rate and the increase of the number 211 of sick people from the start of measures till the peak for the Chinese data (Appendix A1). 212",

Re-entry of the virus from 220 countries outside China now needs to be prevented. Because the vast majority of the 221 population is not immune to SARS-SoV2, the virus can rapidly re-establish. Therefore, 222 suppression needs to be followed up by containment, a strategy based on strict surveillance, 223 testing of all individuals with symptoms, and followed by isolation of all infected individuals 224and their recent contacts[11]. Currently, quarantine restrictions are gradually being lifted in 225 China, including Hubei Province, after no new cases have been detected for several weeks, 226 allowing people to return to work and businesses to start up again. Moreover, in China, 227 schools are preparing to reopen in April and normal social activities are slowly resuming[28]. 228 These findings indicate that the implemented measures have been effective for controlling 229 Many individuals infected with SARS-CoV2 show minimal or no symptoms. Due in part to 232 asymptomatic carriers, many infected individuals remain untested and unreported. Before 31 233 March, asymptomatic cases were not included in in the outbreak's daily report in China [32]. 234 17. Batista M.
