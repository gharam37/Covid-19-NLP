Herein, we report the remarkable sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to recombinant 36 human interferons \u03b1 and \u03b2 (IFN\u03b1/\u03b2). Treatment with IFN-\u03b1 at a concentration of 50 international units (IU) per 37 milliliter drastically reduces viral titers by 3.4 log or over 4 log, respectively, in Vero cells. The EC50 of IFN-\u03b1 38 and IFN-\u03b2 treatment is 1.35 IU/ml and 0.76 IU/ml, respectively, in Vero cells. These results suggest that SARS-39 CoV-2 is more sensitive than many other human pathogenic viruses, including SARS-CoV. Overall, our results 40 demonstrate the potent efficacy of human Type I IFN in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection, a finding which 41 could inform future treatment options for COVID-19.",
