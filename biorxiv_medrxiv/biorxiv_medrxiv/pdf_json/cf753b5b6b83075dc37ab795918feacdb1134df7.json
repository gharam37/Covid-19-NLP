            "text": "The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic COVID 19. COVID-19-associated deaths are mainly attributed to severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. Recent work demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the lung. To better understand ACE2 abundance and expression patterns in the lung we interrogated our in-house single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset containing 70,085 EPCAM+ lung epithelial cells from paired normal and lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a diverse repertoire of airway lineages that included alveolar type I and II, bronchioalveolar, club/secretory, quiescent and proliferating basal, ciliated and malignant cells as well as rare populations such as ionocytes. While the fraction of lung epithelial cells expressing ACE2 was low (1.7% overall), alveolar type II (AT2, 2.2% ACE2+) cells exhibited highest levels of ACE2 expression among all cell subsets. Further analysis of the AT2 compartment (n = 27,235 cells) revealed a number of genes co-expressed with ACE2 that are important for lung pathobiology including those associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; HHIP), pneumonia and infection (FGG and C4BPA) as well as malarial/bacterial (CD36) and viral (DMBT1) scavenging which, for the most part, were increased in smoker versus light or non-smoker cells. Notably, DMBT1 was highly expressed in AT2 cells relative to other lung epithelial subsets and its expression positively correlated with ACE2.",

Recent analyses reported that COVID-19 patients who were smokers required more aggressive clinical interventions and that smoking possibly elevates the risk of COVID-19 associated pneumonia and death 4, 5 . These findings suggest that limiting inflammatory responses by intercepting pathways involved pulmonary (and perhaps cardiac) pathobiology may represent viable strategies to improve COVID-19 patient outcomes. lung injury mediated by SARS-CoV infection which was also alleviated by targeting the RAS 15 .

Among all lung epithelial subsets, we found that ACE2 expression was higher in uninvolved AT2 cells and malignant epithelial cells. We interrogated single-cell gene co-expression profiles and found that ACE2-epressing AT2 cells concurrently expressed other genes with important yet understudied roles in lung pathobiology including fibrosis, modulation of chronic inflammation and innate host-defense mechanisms by additional viral receptors and scavengers, particularly among cells from smokers. Our single-cell analyses highlight additional possible receptors that may play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung epithelium and, thus, are plausible targets that can be repurposed for clinical management of COVID-19.",

In line with studies of other organs 21 , we noted that the fraction of epithelial (EPCAM+) cells attained by unbiased analysis of lung tissues was limited (~4%, n = 624 cells) ( Table 2) . To better capture lung epithelial cells, including their heterogeneity, we performed single-cell analysis of fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) enriched EPCAM+ cells from three normal lung tissues (per patient) and LUADs from four additional patients. Using this strategy, we were able to capture on average 20-fold more lung epithelial cells ( Table 2 ).

The highest fractions of ACE2expressing cells were found in the malignant (3.5%), AT2 (2.2%) and club/secretory (2.4%) cell clusters (Fig. 2a) . Among those clusters with > 1% ACE2-positive cells, AT2 cells expressed the highest expression of ACE2 (Fig. 2b) . We then explored expression patterns of other members of the RAS 27 (Fig. 2c) . Of note, RAS genes were expressed at low levels in AT2 cells compared to other epithelial cell subsets and AT1 cells exhibited relatively higher expression of various RAS members such as adrenergic 2 beta receptor (ADRB2) (Fig. 2c) . We then examined ACE2 expression in subclusters of AT2 and malignant cells, the two populations with relatively highest fraction of cells positive for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor (Fig. S2) . The AT2 subcluster (AT2_c2) with relatively highest expression of ACE2 ( Fig. S2a and Fig. S2b ) exhibited similar levels of RAS genes compared to other AT2 subclusters except for elevated expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the carboxypeptidase CPM (Fig. S2c) . Similarly, we did not find similar patterns of expression between The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.045617 doi: bioRxiv preprint significantly higher in losartan treated patients (P < 10 -16 ; Fig. S3 ). We also examined the expression and abundance patterns of TMPRS22, a serine protease recently shown to be crucial for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein priming upon host cell entry 6 , as well as ADAM17, a sheddase that was shown to cleave (shed) ACE2 30 . TMPRSS2 expression level and frequency were highest in AT2 cells among all lung subsets, whereas ADAM17 expression levels were highest in malignant cells (Fig. S4) . Also, among AT2 cells, expression levels of TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 were highest in the same AT2 subcluster as ACE2 (Figs. S2b and S4b) .",

A cutoff of absolute gene expression fold-change >1.2 and an FDR q-value < 0.05 were applied to select DEGs between ACE2-expressing and ACE2-absent AT2 cells. We found genes upregulated in ACE2-expressing AT2 cells that are highly pertinent to lung epithelial biology and disease such as HHIP (lung branching and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/COPD, 31, 32 ) , FGG (fibrosis, pneumonia and inflammation, 33, 34 ) and C4BPA (complement system, pneumonia and infection, 35, 36 ) ( Fig. 3) . In addition, we found that ACE2-expressing AT2 cells exhibited significantly higher expression of scavengers such as CD36 37 and DMBT1, a pattern recognition receptor that plays crucial host defense roles against bacterial and viral pathogens including influenza A and human immune deficiency virus I (HIV-I) 38 . Interestingly, DMBT1 expression was markedly and distinctly highest in AT2 cells relative to other lung cell subsets (Fig. S5a) . Also, DMBT1 expression in AT2 cells was higher compared to other coronavirus receptors such as the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 39, 40 and BSG (also known as CD147) which was recently suggested to represent a potential alternate route of entry for SARS-CoV-2 41 (Fig. S5a) . Also, DMBT1 displayed similar patterns of expression with ACE2 among AT2 (Fig. S5b ) and lung malignant cell (Fig. S5c) subclusters.",

ACE2-expressing AT2 cells co-expressed genes with crucial roles in lung pathological conditions such as COPD, pneumonia and pathogen infection including the viral binding scavenger DMBT1 and which overall were higher in cells derived from smokers relative to non/light smokers.

Our analysis also revealed significantly elevated ACE2 levels, among ACE2-positive AT2 and malignant cells, in patients who were on hypertension treatment with losartan compared to those without antihypertensive therapy. While our finding is in line with previous reports suggesting that antihypertensive agents may augment ACE2 expression 28, 29, 50 , it needs to be interpreted with caution. Our patient cohort is very limited in size and our study was designed with a focus on singlecell analysis of lung epithelial cells. We thus cannot construe the implications of this finding on COVID-19 management 50, 51 and further studies are warranted to better (e.g., larger cohort) explore the association between treatment with antihypertensive drugs and ACE2 expression in human cells.",

The hedgehog interacting protein HHIP was not only shown to play important roles in airway branching during lung development 32 , but also single nucleotide polymorphisms of this gene are associated with increased risk for COPD 31 , a pulmonary ailment characterized by chronic inflammation 52 . FGG coding for fibrinogen-gamma was shown to be induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines 34 and to be elevated in lung pneumonia and infection 33 . C4BPA, coding for C4BP and part of the complement system, was found to recognize and bind pneumonia-causing streptococci in the lung epithelium 35, 36 . It is noteworthy that many patients with COVID-19 (e.g. those with severe disease) commonly display the same pathological phenotypes, namely lung inflammation, fibrosis, and pneumonia, linked to those ACE2-co-expressed genes. It is intriguing to suggest that perhaps this small population of ACE2expressing cells may underlie the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia and respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. It is important to note that emerging studies are showing that males are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, possibly due to sex-based immunological bias or differences in smoking patterns and prevalence 53 . Also, a recent preprint suggested that smoking causes expansion of ACE2-expressing lung epithelia 42 .

Of note, smoking increases lung inflammation and the risk for various lung diseases including interstitial lung fibrosis, pneumonia and COPD 54 . It is plausible that smoking may augment SARS-CoV-2 entry in the lung and COVID-19 pathogenesis, a supposition that warrants future studies.",

Further, DMBT1 correlated with AT2 fractions in independent cohorts of bulk-sequenced lung tissues and positive correlated with ACE2 in the AT2 compartment.

Our findings on expression of ACE2 in AT2 cells are in line with previous studies 44, 45 . Hamming et al showed abundant immunohistochemical expression of ACE2 protein in AT2 cells in the lung 45 . Ace2 was shown to not only to be expressed in AT2 cells in the mouse lung but also to regulate alveolar epithelial cell survival 46 . Of note, Mossel and colleagues demonstrated that SARS-CoV, by binding to ACE2, replicates primarily in AT2 and not AT1 cells 44 . Also, AT2 cells were shown to be primarily responsible in the lung for an innate immune response against infection with SARS-CoV 47 .Interestingly, a very recent preprint by Zhao and colleagues revealed that ACE2 expression was concentrated in a small population (~1.4%) of AT2 cells 48 . Our findings are in very close agreement with the preprint by Zhao et al in which we find that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is expressed in a minute fraction of AT2 cells (~2.2%). Here, we further interrogated a relatively larger and more diverse repertoire of airway lineages, from both normal and lung tumor (LUAD) tissues, and found that ACE2 expression was not only highest in AT2 cells but also that malignant cells exhibited the highest ACE2positive fraction. It is worthwhile to mention that patients with cancer, including lung malignancy, may represent a population that is extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 49 .
