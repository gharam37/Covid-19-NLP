Other functional effects are possible 291 also; for example, female variant carriers might have a shorter asymptomatic period, or be more likely 292 to develop symptoms, irrespective of viral shedding status. Given that a limited number of coding 293 variants in ACE2 are predicted to affect the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, these variants could 294 be genotyped rapidly in early-onset cases (e.g. paediatric cases, or even cases under age 40) as a pilot 295 study in the United States and/or in European countries where case numbers are high, case fatality 296 appears to be high and the rare alleles are likely to be found. The delivery of viral nucleic acid testing 297 to affected populations is a more urgent need, but given that many viral samples are already being 298 collected, the addition of a rapid assay targeting the SNVs listed here would be an efficient means to 299 gather data to test this hypothesis. Notably, tests of rare variant burden do lose power rapidly if neutral 300 variants and variants with opposing functional effects are grouped together, so we have restricted 301 ourselves to variants with prior evidence of involvement in SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding. There 302 are many more missense ACE2 variants in gnomAD; the aggregate crude prevalence of all rare (i.e. 303 excluding the common p.Asn720Asp) missense variants in gnomAD males is 2.49% and in gnomAD 304 females is 5.81%. Furthermore, among patients with extreme outcomes such as death from COVID-19 305 in childhood (or asymptomatic super-spreaders, if any are found), sequencing of the entire ACE2 306 coding region might conceivably identify ultra-rare \"private\" variants not catalogued in gnomAD, 307 enabling assessment of the role of these variants in the conversion from initial SARS-CoV-2 infection 308 to COVID-19.

Glu37Lys increased the binding the most, followed by 246 contribute to the binding of other partners, but not likely the S protein. Several variants were 248 predicted to weaken binding between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: Asn720Asp weakened 249 binding somewhat, with Ser43Arg, Gly326Glu, Met82Ile and Lys26Arg all weakening binding 250 progressively more. The fact that Lys26Glu and Lys26Arg seem to have opposing effects suggests that 251 the bulkier arginine side chain may not pack as tightly with viral S protein, whereas replacing the basic 252 lysine with an acidic glutamate residue may disrupt important polar interactions.30  Brielle et al. note 253 that the Phe486 of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for binding ACE2 residues Leu79 and Met82, thereby 254 stabilizing the S protein-ACE2 interaction. 31 Methionine 82 interacts with Phe486 of the viral protein's 255 RBD via van der Waals forces, so an isoleucine at this position may weaken this interaction. 30 Yan et 256 al. note that Arg426 of SARS-CoV forms a salt bridge with Glu329 on ACE2, and that SARS-CoV-2 257 has Asn439 at the analogous position, which cannot form this salt bridge. We speculate here that 258 replacing glutamate 329 with a smaller glycine side chain in the p.Glu329Gly variant may allow easier 259 binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein's Asn439, though this remains to be tested. 260 Discussion 261 At the time of this writing, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 1,250,000 people, with over 335,000 262 cases in the United States, approximately 130,000 cases in each of Italy and Spain, over 100,000 cases 263 in Germany and nearly as many again in France. China has reported 3,333 deaths among 82,602 264 cases; 32 since new cases have dropped precipitously there, we may estimate a fatality rate among 265 recognized cases at 4%. However, Spain has reported over 12,500 deaths, and Italy has reported nearly 266 16,000 deaths. Though a large number of asymptomatic and/or unreported cases would dilute the true 267 case-fatality rate, fatality rates of 9.6% and 12% among the subset of cases that are recognized and 268 reported are significant. The speed of the pandemic and the large number of affected cases worldwide 269 justify efforts to identify all possible risk factors for adverse outcomes, including efforts to identify 270 genetic susceptibility factors in human hosts. Even relatively rare susceptibility factors (1% or fewer 271 carriers) may become quantitatively important in the context of hundreds of thousands of infections. A 272 small number of asymptomatic carriers, or a small number of super-spreaders, or a small segment of 273 the population that is disproportionately likely to require intensive care, can magnify the medical, 274 social and economic impacts of a pandemic of this size. 275The genetic component of host-pathogen interaction studies forms a subset of gene-by-276 environment interaction studies.
