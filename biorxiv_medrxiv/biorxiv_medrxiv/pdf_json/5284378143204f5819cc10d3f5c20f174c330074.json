We developed mathematical models to predict reasonable bounds on the date of end of the COVID-19 epidemics in mainland China with strong quarantine and testing measures for a sufficiently long time. We used reported data in China from January 20, 2020 to April 9, 2020. We firstly used a deterministic approach to obtain a formula to compute the probability distribution of the extinction date by combining the models and continuous-time Markov processes. Then we present the individual based model (IMB) simulations to compare the result by deterministic approach and show the absolute difference between the estimated cumulative probability distribution computed by simulations and formula. We provide the predictions of the last day of epidemic for different fractions f of asymptomatic infectious that become reported symptomatic infectious.",

COVID-19 was brought under control in mainland China with these strong measures. Since March 12, the number of daily reported cases imported from mainland China has been kept within 5 for several weeks in mainland China. One of the most concerned issues now is the duration of the epidemic of COVID-19 in mainland China. However, there are several challenges to such analysis. COVID-19 can be contagious during the incubation period. The fraction of asymptomatic infectious cases and unreported cases (with mild symptom) and their contagiousness are of major importance in understanding the evolution of COVID-19 epidemic, and involves great difficulty in their estimation.",

            "text": "As coronavirus outbreaks surge worldwide, more and more facts [11] show that many new patients which are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms can transmit the virus. Researches both in [12] and [4] have confirmed that asymptomatic transmission occurs. It has been shown in [14] that some new crown pneumonia patients had higher viral levels in the throat swabs during the early stage of the disease. [10] reported that 13 evacuees from Wuhan, China on chartered flights were infected, of whom 4, never developed symptoms and the estimated asymptomatic proportion in [3] is at 17.9%. A team in China [13] suggests that by February 18, there were 37,400 people with the virus in Wuhan whom authorities didn't know about. Research in [5] estimates 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%-90%]) prior to January 23, 2020 travel restrictions. The transmission rate of undocumented infections was 55% of documented infections ([46%-62%]). Due to their greater numbers, undocumented infections were the infection source for 79% of documented cases. The asymptomatic and mild symptomatic cases were missed because authorities aren't doing enough testing, or 'preclinical cases' in which people are incubating the virus but would not be ill enough to seek medical help, would probably slip past screening methods such as temperature checks. The asymptomatic and unreported cases are just going to be really critical for explaining the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging.",

Our models of the COVID-19 epidemic incorporate the key features of this epidemic: (1) the importance of the timing and magnitude of the implementation of major government public restrictions designed to mitigate the severity of the epidemic; (2) the importance of asymptomatic infectious, reported (with sever symptom) and unreported (with mild symptom) cases in interpreting the number of reported cases. This article is devoted to the duration of the epidemic of COVID-19 in mainland China. The duration of the stochastic epidemic has been considered in the 70th by Barbour [1] . We refer Britton and Pardoux [2] for more results about stochastic epidemic models. Our goal in the present paper is to investigate the duration of the epidemic of COVID-19 in mainland China in function of the fraction of unreported cases.",

We should note the following fact: Before February 11, the cumulative data of the reported cases was confirmed by testing. From February 11, the cumulative data included cases that were not tested for the virus, but were clinically diagnosed based on medical imaging. The cumulative data from February 10 to February 15 specified both types of reported cases. But from February 16, the data did not separate the two types of reporting, but reported the sum of both types which makes it impossible for us to know the number of cases tested. There were total 17,409 clinically diagnosed cases from February 10 to February 15. We subtracted 17,409 cases from the cumulative reported cases after February 15 to obtain the approximate data by testing only after February 15 as shown in Table 1 with this adjustment. Note that on January 23 rd 2020 mainland China started the lock-down of Wuhan city, and implemented other interventions soon on other Chinese cities.",

The dark green area contains 68% of the trajectories, and the light green area 95%. In figure (d) we plot the mean value and variance of CR (cumulated reported) computed from the IBM. The dark gray area contains 68% of the trajectories, and the light gray area 95%. We use 500 independent runs of the IBM simulations. The parameters we used for both computations are the following: I 0 = 93, U 0 = 5, S 0 = 1.40005 \u00d7 10 9 \u2212 (I 0 + U 0 ), R 0 = RR 0 = CR 0 = 0 and f = 0.8, \u03c4 0 = 3.3655 \u00d7 10 \u221210 , N = 26, \u00b5 = 0.148, \u03bd = 1 7 , \u03b7 = 1 7 , t 0 = 13.3617.",
