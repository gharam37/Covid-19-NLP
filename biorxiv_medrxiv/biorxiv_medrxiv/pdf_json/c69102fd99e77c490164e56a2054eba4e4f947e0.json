In this study, an adapted SIR model previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak was applied to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases in the case of the Portuguese situation. As some of the parameters were unknown, and the data for Portugal is still scarce, given that the outbreak started later (first case on the 2nd of March) I used Italian data (first reported case in Italy on the 31st of January) to predict them. I then construct five different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal, considering both the effectiveness of the mitigation measurements implemented by the government, and the selfprotective measures taken by the population, as explained in the South Korean model.",

In the most severe cases, covid-19 can lead to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock, multiorgan failure, and even death [6] . Studies suggest that the case fatality rate of the virus is of about 3.5% in mainland China [7] . However, this value seems to be much higher in Italy [8] , suggesting its strong dependence on demographics [9] . The WHO declared Europe as the new epicentre of the disease on the 13th of March of 2020 [10] . The rapid growth of the number of active cases presenting severe symptoms has saturated the health services in most countries in the continent, especially in Italy [11] . Governments throughout Europe have implemented severe measures to prevent and mitigate the spread of the virus. Yet, as of the 20th of March there were as many as 129,811 confirmed cases on the European continent, resulting in 6,069 deaths [2, 3] . In Portugal, the two first confirmed cases in the Portuguese territory were announced on the 2nd of March,.As of the 20 th of March, there were 1,020 confirmed cases, 6 deaths, and 5 recovered [12] . Also, the country is on lockdown since the 13th of March 2020, and the Portuguese Parliament declared a State of Emergency on the 18th of March 2020. Many models have been used to study the spread of covid-19 [13, 14] , In this study, a model of the SIR type used in South-Korea to model the evolution of the active cases of the MERS outbreak in the country back in 2015 [15] was adapted. In order to fit the parameters, and given that there is still very little data in the case of Portugal, the data of Italy was used. This allowed to fit the curve of current active cases in Portugal with a model, which is then used to predict the future number of cases, in five different scenarios.",

In this model, \u03b3 is originally defined as \"the clinical outbreak rate in all the infected cases. In the cases of the fits of \u03bb, \u03b4, and k2, the ansatz value used for \u03b3 had a very strong impact in the results of the other parameters. This could be due to two things: the huge uncertainty there is at the moment for the appropriate incubation time of this virus, which some authors claim can be of up to 27 days [21] [22] , and the uncertainty in how many in the symptomatic and asymptomatic cases are actually being tested. The model assumes that only those symptomatic are being tested which seems like a good approximation, but it comes with a lot of uncertainty. The obtained value for \u03b4 = 0.0168 is 24% the value obtained by Xia et al [15] of 0.0660, which is just about the ratio in case fatality rates between the SARS-covid-2 (7.2% currently for Italy), and MERS (estimated at 34%) This seems reasonable, although the case fatality rate of the SARS-covid-2 is still difficult to ascertain. Finally, from the obtained values it is also possible to determine a value for the basic reproduction number R0, which here I take as being simply the value R0=2*b/(k1+k2)=14.5 which is extremely high, and demonstrates how strong the capacity for spreading of this particular virus is. In table 5, the final values of the obtained parameters are given.",

This model takes the values of active cases and compares them with official confirmed numbers, which not only may be smaller than the actual cases, as are released at an administratively defined time, which does not correspond to something realistic.
