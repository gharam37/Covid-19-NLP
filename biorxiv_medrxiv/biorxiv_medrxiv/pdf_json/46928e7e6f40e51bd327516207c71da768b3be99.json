In addition, ChAdOx1 MERS vaccination resulted in full protection of human DPP4 transgenic mice against a lethal challenge with MERS-CoV (14) . ChAdOx1 MERS vaccination of dromedary camels was immunogenic and reduced MERS-CoV shedding after challenge in a natural transmission model (15) . ChAd-vectored vaccines against malaria, HIV, influenza, hepatitis C, tuberculosis, Ebola, and others show an excellent immunogenicity and safety profile in humans. In the current manuscript, we show that a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine protects rhesus macaque model against a mucosal challenge with HCoV-EMC/2012. Serum obtained from vaccinated rhesus macaques was able to neutralize six diverse MERS-CoV strains. Furthermore, a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine protects hDPP4 transgenic mice against all evaluated MERS-CoV strains.",

Animals were then challenged with 7 x 10 6 TCID50 HCoV-EMC/2012 on 0 DPI via combined intratracheal, intranasal, oral and ocular route (16) . Blood samples were taken at days of vaccination, 14 days post each vaccination, and at challenge ( Figure 1A) . The humoral immune response to vaccination was examined by ELISA using S protein as well as by virus neutralization assay. S protein-specific IgG antibodies were detected as early as 14 days post vaccination in both ChAdOx1 MERS vaccinated groups. All animals in these groups had Sprotein-specific antibodies at 0 DPI, whereas no antibodies against S protein were found before vaccination, or at any time in the ChAdOx1 GFP vaccinated group ( Figure 1B) . Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 11 out of 12 ChAdOx1 MERS vaccinated animals at time of challenge. One animal in the prime-only vaccination group did not have detectable neutralizing antibodies at this time and had the lowest antibody titer as measured by ELISA (1600) ( Figure  P<0 .0001) and neutralizing antibody titer (mean titer -28 DPI = 28; 0 DPI = 160; P<0.0001) as determined via Tukey's multiple comparisons test, even though neutralizing antibodies against the ChAdOx1 vector could be detected at the time of the second vaccination ( Figure S1A ). This suggests that the presence of neutralizing antibodies against ChAdOx1 does not prevent the vaccine vector from boosting the immune response. Serum samples were collected from non-human primates at times of vaccination (-56 DPI and -28 DPI), 14 days later and at challenge. (A) Overview of experimental timeline.

(C) ELISA-positive two-fold serial-diluted serum samples were tested for neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV in VeroE6 cells. Line = geometric mean, dotted line = limit of detection.

It is important that a MERS-CoV vaccine does not only provides homologous protection, but also against other MERS-CoV strains. We previously showed full protection of ChAdOx1 MERS (based on the Camel/Qatar/2/2014 strain) vaccinated hDPP4 transgenic mice after heterologous challenge with HCoV-EMC/2012 (14). Here, we repeated this challenge and extended the experiment to include five other MERS-CoV strains. We utilized strains from Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Burkina Faso, obtained from dromedary camels or humans, and isolated between 2012 and 2018 and showed full protection against all strains when mice were vaccinated with ChAdOx1 MERS in a prime-only regimen. Moreover, sera obtained at day of challenge from rhesus macaques vaccinated with ChadOx1 MERS efficiently neutralized all six MERS-CoV strains indicating that vaccination with ChAdOx1 MERS can protect against a variety of different MERS-CoV strains. Based on these results, future clinical development studies are planned with this ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine, supported by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).",
