Transmission events were monitored prospectively during the critical period of implementation of national control measures. SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced from 209 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between January and March 2020. Only a quarter of cases appeared to be locally acquired and genomic-based estimates of local transmission rates were concordant with predictions from a computational agent-based model. This convergent assessment indicates that genome sequencing provides key information to inform public health action and has improved our understanding of the COVID-19 evolution from outbreak to epidemic.",

As of 18 th April 2020, the number of global cases had surpassed 2,000,000, following multiple worldwide independent importations of infection from visitors and returned travellers making the control of this disease of prime global public health importance 3, 4 . Major outbreaks have been documented in South Korea, Iran, the USA and Europe 2,3 . At the time of writing, person-to-person transmission had been documented primarily through household contacts 5 , with up to 85% of human-to-human transmission occurring in family or household clusters 6, 7 . The rapid growth in the number of COVID-19 cases with associated morbidity and mortality has overburdened healthcare facilities and the workforce.

Epidemic models of COVID-19 have suggested that virus transmission can be significantly disrupted by rapid detection and quarantine of infectious cases and their close contacts 8 . However, validation of COVID-19 modelling predictions is becoming increasingly important since many are built using incomplete and inconsistent data and thus produce divergent outcomes 9,10 , thus affecting confidence in public health policy directions. Here, we use the combination of near real-time SARS-CoV-2 genomic and public health surveillance data to verify inferences from computational models. Genomic epidemiology has become a high-resolution tool for public health surveillance and disease control [11] [12] [13] and the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered unrivalled efforts for the real-time genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have already been sequenced and made publicly available on GISAID (the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) 14 . Importantly, the ongoing analysis of this global data set suggests no significant differences or links between SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence variability and virus transmissibility or disease severity 15 .

Particular strengths of this study were integration of high-resolution genomic data with local epidemiology data and inferences made by agent-based modelling, providing context and confirmation for the genomic results and clustering. Our prospective SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing has been instrumental in not only defining local transmission events and clusters, but enabling 68% of the cases for which no epidemiological links had been identified to be assigned to known epidemiological clusters, thereby allowing more efficient public health follow-up. The fine scale resolution provided by the genomic analyses presented in this study will become increasingly important for the containment of local outbreaks by enabling identification of This observation based on the first ten weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic warrants further data collection in order to capture the impact of border control and social distancing measures introduced during the time of this study.

A consensus sequence was called for positions where depth >10, quality >20 with a minimum frequency threshold of 0.1. The 5' and 3' UTR regions were masked from the consensus due to poor quality of these regions.

The decision to close the Australian border to all except Australian citizens, residents and immediate family members was announced on March 20 th . Our phylogenetic analysis of unique sequences suggested or confirmed the country of origin for some cases and identified genomically clustered cases often associated with epidemiologically linked cases(Fig.1b). This analysis documented genomically similar cases associated with concurrent community-based transmission in several institutions within the first ten weeks of the epidemic in Australia. However, it was not possible to infer a directionality of virus spread during these early stages of the epidemic as the rate of virus transmission is evidently greater than the rate of evolutionary change in the virus genome16 . Our genomic data have also confirmed the dominance of overseas acquired infections in these early stages of the epidemic in Australia despite initial border control measures.",

The agent-based models capture interactions of individuals in time and space using government census data and detailed transmission pathways. The convergent estimates of local transmission from the computational model and genome sequencing not only validated COVID-19 modelling predictions but also suggested that our sampling of COVID-19 cases have been adequate for discovery and monitoring local transmission events in the time of cocirculation of genomically similar strains of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings extend the value of genomic surveillance in depicting transmission pathways and evolution of emerging pathogens 13,21,22 . They also improve our understanding and support the implementation of genomically enhanced surveillance for more efficient COVID-19 control strategies and the investigation of cases with unclear infection sources and within a short turn-around-time ( 16,17,21,22 ). The initial delay of 21 days between date of collection and sequencing for the first three samples received included the time taken to establish the in-house amplicon-based WGS method used in this study. The power of such surveillance is augmented by international sharing of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data collected by researchers and public health microbiology service providers 23,24 . Our clinical specimens originated from a mixture of private and public pathology providers, thus our sample likely represented a general population with a spectrum of clinical disease. We relied on an average sequence depth greater than 200 to ensure quality of short read mapping and genome comparisons in line with previous reports 20,25 , although further optimisation of may be required for sustainable and cost-effective SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. In conclusion, this genomic survey of SARS-CoV-2 in a subpopulation of infected patients in the first ten weeks of COVID-19 activity in Australia enabled proactive monitoring of local transmission events in the critical time of implementation of national COVID-19",

The RT-PCR assay utilised WHO recommended primers and probes targeting regions in the E gene and RdRp domain (20). Samples were submitted directly to ICPMR for RT-PCR testing and also referred from other NSW Health Pathology and private pathology laboratories for genome sequencing. Genome sequencing was attempted on all PCR positive samples with a RT-PCR Ct value <30. Epidemiological data and case definitions. Public health follow-up was conducted in parallel for each COVID-19 case. Travel histories were collected and used to determine whether infections were acquired locally or overseas. The origin and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases detected in NSW during the study period were publicly available and obtained from the NSW Health website 26 . An imported case was defined as a person who tested SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive and reported international travel in the 14 days before the onset of illness. A locally acquired case was a person who tested SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive and had not travelled outside of Australia in the 14 days before illness onset. Locally acquired cases were further classified on epidemiological grounds as confirmed contacts of a case, as part of a known cluster, or of unknown origin (i.e. no known contact with a case). Close contacts were defined as individuals who had been in the same closed space for at least two hours with a laboratory-confirmed case (i.e. someone who tested positive for COVID-19) when that person was infectious 27 . The decision to close the Australian border to all except Australian citizens, residents and immediate family members was announced on March 20 th . Stage 1 and 2 restrictions were implemented on March 23 rd and 26 th respectively. Stage 1 restrictions included closure of all restaurants, gymnasiums, cinemas and places of worship, as well as avoiding non-essential travel, outdoor gatherings of >500 and indoor gatherings of >100 people. Stage 2 restrictions",

            "text": "Agent-based model. We used an agent-based model (ABM) developed to trace the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Australia40 . This model has been specifically calibrated to reproduce several key characteristics of COVID-19 transmission in Australia, including its reproductive number (R0 = 2.2.7), the length of incubation and generation periods (5.0 and 6.4 days, respectively), age-dependent fractions of the symptomatic cases (0.669 and 0.134, for adults and children, respectively) and the probability of transmission from asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic agents (0.3 of symptomatic individuals). The ABM comprises approximately 24 million software agents, each with attributes of an anonymous individual, matching key demographic statistics from the 2016 Australian Census data as well as other data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA). Contact and transmission rates were set to differ across distinct social contexts, such as households, household clusters, local neighbourhoods, schools, classrooms and workplaces. The ABM simulation processes and updates agents' states over time, starting from initial infections, seeded in international airports around Australia, using demographics and mobility layers previously developed and applied to trace influenza pandemics 41-42 . Local transmissions were defined as links in the chains originated by all initial infections detected within a given context, i.e., progressing through households (HH) and household clusters (HC). In other words, transmissions occurring across the wider community are not counted as local transmissions, but are still detected in order to investigate the overall connectivity of emerging local \"clusters\". Thus, each local transmission chain may include links from several mixing contexts: HH, HC and wider neighbourhood, represented by statistical local area (SLA) mapped to Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) in the 2016 census (SLAs are Local Government Areas or part thereof). The COVID-19 model has been validated with the most recent disease surveillance data, being able to predict both the incidence and prevalence peaks in early to mid-April 2020 40 . Ethics statement. Clinical specimens were routinely processed at the Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research (ICPMR) and deemed not research. A non-research determination for this project was granted by the Health Protection NSW as it was a designated communicable disease control activity.author/funder. All rights reserved.
