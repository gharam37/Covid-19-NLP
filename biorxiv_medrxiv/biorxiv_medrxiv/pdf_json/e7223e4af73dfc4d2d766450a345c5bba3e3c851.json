            "text": "There is much debate about the nature of the relationship between spousal loss and subsequent adverse health outcomes. First, is the observed increase in the risk of death truly the consequence of bereavement, or is it-at least partly-attributable to phenotypical similarities between deceased individuals and their surviving spouse? For instance, assortative mating, convergence in lifestyle and shared environment throughout adulthood may very well be at play. 14 Previous studies have often been unable to convincingly establish a causal link between bereavement and mortality because of a lack of information on socioeconomic and health-related confounders at the time of spousal loss. 3 Second, is the potential effect of bereavement mainly fuelled by acute factors that influence health immediately after spousal loss or is it a mostly silent and prolonged process that accumulates over time? Although there is some evidence that the mortality risk associated with the loss of a partner is highest during the first year after widowhood and becomes weaker as time elapses, little is known about the exact shape of this association over time. 3, 15, 16 Third, does the potential effect of spousal bereavement on physical health extend beyond mortality? Prior research has shown that compared with non-bereaved individuals those who recently lost a spouse may have a higher risk of acute cardiovascular events. 17 However, the only large study published to date on this topic 18 relied exclusively on electronic records from primary care without linkage to hospital diagnoses or causes of death, thereby potentially underestimating the actual number of cases. Fourth, most studies have examined the association between widowhood and mortality without differentiating the end-of-life trajectory of the deceased spouse. For instance, are older persons whose spouse died from dementia (often preceded by a long period of informal care) at greater excess risk of negative health consequences than those who lost their partner from another cause of death? Investigating potential differences between illness trajectories is an important step to identify caregivers at high risk of adverse health events and to design targeted interventions. Finally, there is a need to evaluate health outcomes longitudinally, both before and after spousal loss. Measuring withinindividual changes in the risk of experiencing negative health outcomes would allow for disentangling the potential effect of bereavement from that of pre-bereavement experiences such as caring for a seriously ill spouse near the end of life. [19] [20] [21] The present study aimed to overcome some of the limitations of previous work by addressing each of these five issues. We examined the risk of death and adverse health outcomes associated with spousal bereavement among community-dwellers aged 65 years and older by analysing routinely collected administrative and healthcare data with two different epidemiological designs (matched cohort and selfcontrolled cohort crossover) and by applying a variety of methods to assess and mitigate the risk of bias inherent to the observational nature of the study.",

In addition, spouses who died on the exact same day or from shared causes within 30 days (e.g. as a consequence of the same road-traffic accident) were excluded.

This approach has, for instance, been proposed to study the risk of aortic dissection during pregnancy 34 or to quantify the excess risk of injury during the period shortly before and after a diagnosis of cancer. 35 In our study, we defined a reference period from 18 until 12 months before spousal loss (T0), and we calculated the relative risk of adverse health outcomes from 1 year before until 1 year after spousal loss by dividing person time into four 6-month periods (182 days), from T1 to T4 (Figure 2 ).

We computed relative incidence ratios (RIR) for each outcome by entering a bereavement-by-time interaction term in the model. 42 This was done to account for the fact that incidence rates during pre-bereavement periods are conditional on survival until the date of spousal loss and, thus, that the observed incidence rates after that date may partly stem from lefttruncation bias. Relative incidence ratios can be interpreted as the relative increase in the risk of experiencing adverse health outcomes among bereaved cases compared with the increase among married controls. This analytical strategy presents the advantage of eliminating the influence of timeinvariant confounders while also removing the effect of time trends in the events. 43 We obtained 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by using robust standard errors to account for clustering within individuals.",

Second, we assembled a set of controls who were neither married nor recently bereaved. Because single and divorced individuals are too few in these birth cohorts and tend to be highly selected in terms of socioeconomic position and lifestyle, we used a cohort of long-time widows and widowers. Each bereaved case was matched on sex and age to a widowed person who had experienced spousal loss more than 5 years prior to the index date (median 11 years) and who did not remarry afterwards. We hypothesised that if the causal effect of spousal bereavement is mostly acute and weakens as time elapses, then the excess risk of adverse health outcomes should be substantially greater among newly bereaved cases compared to married individuals than compared to long-time widows and widowers.",

These negative control outcomes include the incidence of solid cancer, hallux valgus, Parkinson's disease and cataract during the first year of follow-up among individuals without these conditions at baseline. We reasoned that if the association between spousal loss and subsequent health events was truly causal, no association should be observed with biologically implausible health outcomes such as the risk of developing a new solid tumour or Parkinson's disease within one year. 46 A positive association would thus indicate the existence of residual confounding. Fourth, we calculated the E-value for each of the outcomes observed in our matched cohort design. This methodology has been proposed by VanderWeele and colleagues as a way to evaluate how susceptible an association is to potential unmeasured or uncontrolled confounding. 47 The E-value can be defined as the minimum strength of association that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome to fully explain away the observed association between them, conditional on the measured covariates. Finally, we expanded the definition of acute cardiovascular events to include a broader range of conditions than the ones included in the main analysis (e.g. acute endocarditis, non-rheumatic valve disorders, cardiomyopathies, deep vein thrombosis) and we extended the definition of fall-related injuries beyond hip fracture.",

Men have been shown to be more vulnerable to the acute health consequences of grief than women, most likely because of gender differences in social support, coping styles, and health behaviours around the time of bereavement. 49,50 However, contrary to a study that investigated the relative risk of suicide after the loss of a partner in 1994 -1998 women were found to a greater excess risk of self-harm and suicide than men after spousal loss. This was, however, mostly explained by a higher baseline incidence of self-harm among married men in the matched control group. The dramatic increase in self-harm and suicides speaks of the seriousness of the psychological distress experienced by older adults facing the loss of a partner.",

Our results regarding mortality are well aligned with recent findings in Denmark, where the 2.5 times higher risk of death during the first month after spousal loss declined down to 38% six to twelve months later. 55 Additionally, the present study shows that while the risk of acute cardiovascular events, pneumonia, and non-elective hospitalisations also increased in a transient fashion, other outcomes such as hip fractures, injuries due to self-harm, and nursing home admissions remained elevated for longer periods of time. This has important implications for public health and clinical practice, as it means that bereavement support should be offered without delay to mitigate short-term decline and then maintained over a sufficiently long period of time.",

Earlier work has shown that the negative health effects of bereavement varied according to the cause of death of the deceased spouse, but most of these studies used the cause of spousal loss as a way to test for selection bias 56 or to separate expected from unexpected deaths. 57,58 To our knowledge, this is the first large cohort study that has examined the impact of bereavement across different and clinically meaningful illness trajectories. We found that the excess risk of mortality was highest among bereaved older adults whose spouse died suddenly and lowest among those whose spouse died after a trajectory of prolonged dwindling (often marked by the progression of dementia or other neurodegenerative diseases). However, the latter still experience substantially higher rates of death, acute cardiovascular events, hip fractures and self-harm than their married counterparts. In that respect, our findings contrast with the conclusion by Elwert and colleagues that the spouses of people who died from Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease remained unaffected by the widowhood effect. 59 We also observed that bereaved older adults whose spouse died from organ failure experienced a particularly high excess risk of acute cardiovascular events and self-harm, and those whose spouse died from cancer had the highest excess risk of pneumonia after bereavement. Thus, although sudden spousal deaths expose surviving partners to especially high excess mortality, our findings suggest that longer and more predictable illness trajectories do not shield survivors from the adverse health consequences of bereavement. 60",

Our results are consistent with previous work showing substantial changes in the risk of cardiovascular events and injuries during the months before bereavement. 19,61 In a cross-sectional analysis of the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative survey of Americans aged 50 years and older, researchers found that spouses nearing bereavement reported worse mobility, more impairments in instrumental activities of daily living, a greater burden of depressive symptoms and poorer working memory than continuously married individuals. 20 The finding that health outcomes start worsening before spousal death suggests that the observed association between bereavement and ill health is partly attributable to factors that precede widowhood. Thus, any hypothesis for the causal effect of spousal bereavement on health should also explain how the experience of the surviving spouses before the death of their partners contributes to exposing them to serious adverse events.",

Hence, social scientists have suggested that the excess risk of negative health events around the time of bereavement is driven either by selection mechanisms (those who become widows and widowers tend to have a lower socioeconomic position) or by the substantial reduction in material resources already before spousal loss. Although our data shows that bereaved cases have, on average, a lower level of education and income and tend to live in more socially deprived areas compared with married controls, we found no evidence of a socioeconomic gradient in the association between bereavement and mortality. We acknowledge that this may very well be specific to the study population at hand, namely older people whose main source of income was retirement pensions rather than work-related earnings, in a country where the financial toll of widowhood is automatically compensated by a specific pension scheme. Finally, a third hypothesis is that the observed health disadvantage among bereaved relatives is partly due to the caregiving burden, which is well documented among spouses of older people with advanced illness (e.g. cancer, heart failure, dementia). 66,67 Caregiving burden is hypothesised to have a direct impact on mental health and cognition, and to affect physical health through poorer self-management of pre-existing diseases, including lower adherence to essential medicines, and postponing of routine clinical appointments. 68 In a large cohort of 12 722 older people with chronic cardiovascular conditions in the United Kingdom, Shah and colleagues showed that during the year prior to spousal loss there was a lower uptake of basic care processes (e.g. blood pressure and HbA1c measurements) among soon-to-be widows and widowers than among their continuously married counterparts. 69 Similarly, they found that adherence to statins, platelet antiaggregants and renin-angiotensin drugs started declining already during the months preceding spousal death. In the present study, we hypothesise that a large part of the observed increase in the risk of fall-related injuries already during the 6 months before spousal loss can be attributed to the use of sedatives, anxiolytics and hypnotics that are often prescribed to help relatives cope with the psychological stress of caring for someone at the end of life. 70, 71 This suggests that palliative care services could have an important role in detecting high-risk caregivers, providing bereavement counselling already before spousal loss, and signposting to relevant health services (including GPs and other primary care professionals) to ensure adequate management of existing conditions.",

            "text": "older spouses were linked together in a deterministic rather than probabilistic manner, which provides an unbiased classification of bereaved cases and non-bereaved controls. We were able to identify and measure a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related baseline characteristics, thus allowing us to adjust our analyses for important confounders. Matching on sex and date of birth achieved good balance of measured covariates at baseline, which suggests strong empirical equipoise and supports our claim of a causal relationship between spousal bereavement and negative health outcomes. However, the lack of information with regard to important physical (e.g. body-mass index), functional (e.g. gait speed, ADL impairments), lifestyle (e.g. diet, smoking, alcohol use) or familyrelated factors (e.g. level of social support) represents a potential source of residual confounding, which could threaten the validity of our effect estimates. To alleviate this concern, we calculated E-values to evaluate how susceptible the observed associations were to unmeasured confounders. This sensitivity analysis showed that unmeasured confounders would need to be of substantial magnitude to fully explain the adjusted effect estimates. For instance, the observed incidence rate ratio for all-cause mortality (1.66, 95% CI 1.53-1.80) could only be moved to the null by an unmeasured confounder associated with both spousal loss and mortality by a risk ratio of at least 2.70 above and beyond measured confounders. The existence of such confounders is, to the best of our knowledge, highly unlikely. Negative control outcomes with presumed null effect sizes were used to assess the potential for residual systemic bias, which revealed no obvious prognostic imbalance at baseline. We also devised a cohort crossover design to measure within-individual change in the risk of experiencing adverse health outcomes before and after spousal loss among bereaved cases compared with the change among married controls. This approach offers the double advantage of eliminating between-person confounding (measured or otherwise) by using study subjects as their own controls while also attenuating the risk of bias due to left truncation and natural age-related trends. Another important strength of the present study is that all prespecified sensitivity analyses and non-prespecified post-hoc analyses are reported in a clear and transparent manner and explicitly linked to the corresponding hypotheses that we intended to test.",

Another limitation is that the categorization of end-of-life illness trajectories of the deceased spouses is both an over-simplification of the actual trajectory of functional decline that these persons followed and an imperfect proxy for the burden of caregiving that the surviving spouses experienced during the final months and weeks before spousal loss. In the selfcontrolled cohort crossover design, we were unable to conduct subgroup analyses by illness trajectories due to a very low number of events during each hazard period for most outcomes. Moreover, outcomes were limited to serious health events related to somatic conditions. Although we recognize that endpoints related to the development of chronic diseases, quality of life, or mental health are very important to bereaved older adults and highly relevant for clinicians and policy makers, the lack of sufficiently detailed data from primary care practitioners and the risk of detection bias (whereby bereaved individuals would, for instance, be more likely to be reported as having depressive symptoms and worse quality of life) prevented us from including these aspects in the present study. Finally, we were unable to investigate the long-term health consequences of spousal bereavement.",

Hazard ratios obtained from these models correspond to the relative change in the instantaneous rate at which the event of interest occurs among subjects who are currently event-free or who have experienced the competing event. When the event of interest is rare, the subdistribution hazard ratio can be interpreted as an approximation of the relative change in the cumulative incidence of that event.
