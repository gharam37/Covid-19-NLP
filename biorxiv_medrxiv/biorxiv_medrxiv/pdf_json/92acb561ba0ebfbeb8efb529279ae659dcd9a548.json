            "text": "A SIRU-type epidemic model is proposed for the prediction of COVID-19 spreading within Brasil, and analyse the influence of public health measures on simulating the control of this infectious disease. Since the reported cases are typically only a fraction of the total number of the symptomatic infectious individuals, the model accounts for both reported and unreported cases. Also, the model allows for the time variation of both the transmission rate and the fraction of asymptomatic infectious that become reported symptomatic individuals, so as to reflect public health interventions, towards its control, along the course of the epidemic evolution. An analytical exponential behaviour for the accumulated reported cases evolution is assumed at the onset of the epidemy, for explicitly estimating initial conditions, while a Bayesian inference approach is adopted for parametric estimations employing the present direct problem model with the data from the known portion of the epidemics evolution, represented by the time series for the reported cases of infected individuals. The direct-inverse problem analysis is then employed with the actual data from China, with the first half been employed for the parametric estimation and the second half for validation of the predictive capability of the proposed approach. The full dataset for China is then employed in another parameter identification, aimed at refining the values for the average times that asymptomatic infectious individuals and that symptomatic individuals remain infectious. Following this validation, the available data on reported cases in Brasil from February 15 th till March 29 th , 2020, is used for estimating parameters and then predict the epidemy evolution under these conditions. Finally, public health interventions are simulated, aimed at diminishing the effects of the disease spreading, by acting on both the transmission rate and the fraction of the total number of the symptomatic infectious individuals, considering time variable exponential behaviours for these two parameters, usually assumed constant in epidemic evolutions without intervention. It is demonstrated that a combination of actions to affect both parameters can have a much faster and effective result in the control of the epidemy dynamics. : medRxiv preprint the analysis of the impact of public health measures [1], which however did not consider in the modelling the presence of unreported infection cases, which are in practice inherent to this process. The present work is first based on the SIR-type model proposed in [2] , which deals with the epidemic outbreak in Wuhan by introducing the unreported cases in the modelling, and evaluating the consequences of public health interventions. It was a direct application of previous developments [3, 4] on the fundamental problem of parameter identification in mathematical epidemic models, accounting for unreported cases. This same modelling approach was more recently employed in the analysis of the epidemic outbreak in different countries,",

Besides identifying unreported cases, this simple and robust model also allows for introducing a latency period and a time variable transmission rate, which can simulate a public health orientation change such as in a general isolation measure.

The same analytical identification procedure is maintained for the required initial conditions, as obtained from the early stages exponential behaviour. However, a Bayesian inference approach is here adopted for parametric estimation, employing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with the Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . At first, the goal of the inverse problem analysis was estimating the parameters associated with the transmission rate and the fraction of asymptomatic infectious that become reported symptomatic individuals, which can be quite different in the various regions and countries and also very according to the public health measures. Then, in light of the success in this parametric identification, an extended estimation was also employed which incorporates the average time the asymptomatic infectious are asymptomatic and the average time the infectious stay in the symptomatic condition, due to the relative uncertainty on these parameters in the literature. The proposed approach was then applied to the data from China, first by taking just the first half of these data points in the estimation, while using the second half to validate the model using the estimated parameters with just the first half of the epidemy evolution, and second by employing the whole time series in the MCMC estimation procedure, thus identifying parameters for the whole evolution period. This second estimation was particularly aimed at refining the data for the average times that asymptomatic infectious individuals and that symptomatic individuals remain infectious.",

Nevertheless, even after these estimates, a few other parameters in the model remain uncertain, either due to the specific characteristics of the physical conditions or reaction to the epidemy in each specific region, or due to lack of epidemiological information on the disease itself. Therefore, an inverse problem analysis was undertaken aimed at estimating the main parameters involved in the model, as summarized in Table   1 below. First, for the dataset on the accumulated reported cases for China, the focus is on the parametrized time variation of the transmission rate ( 0 and ) and the fraction of asymptomatic infectious that become reported ( 0 ), in this case assumed constant, followed by an effort to refine the information on the average times (1/\u03bd and 1/\u03b7) through All rights reserved.

For this reason, we have also implemented a statistical inverse analysis with the full dataset of China, but now seeking the estimation of five parameters, so as to simultaneously estimate the average times (1/\u03bd and 1/\u03b7). Both uniform and Gaussian distributions were adopted for the two new parameters, with initial guesses of 1/\u03bd=7 days and 1/\u03b7=7 days, and N=29 days, as employed in [6] . Table 3 provides the estimated values and 95% confidence intervals for all five parameters, with Gaussian priors for the two average times with data obtained from [14, 17] . The most affected parameter in comparison with the previous estimates is the average time 1/\u03b7, which is also the one with widest confidence interval. This behaviour is also evident from the Markov chains for this parameter, now simultaneously estimated.

It is also a known fact that the initial amount of kits for blood testing that were purchased by the Brazilian government were finished around this time, and before being fully supplemented, there could have been a reduction on the number of executed exams of the symptomatic individuals, that might have affected the partition of reported to unreported cases by the end of this period covered by the present dataset. Therefore, the more general model including the time variation of the partition f(t), eqs.(4.c,d), is here implemented for a more refined inverse problem analysis. It is then expected that a reduction on the f value can be identified ( < 0 ), with an abrupt variation on the exponential behaviour, here assumed as a sharp functional time dependence (large ). Therefore, an additional statistical inverse problem analysis is undertaken, this time for estimating five parameters, namely, 0 , , 0 , , and , aimed at improving the overall agreement with the CR(t) data behaviour, with a possible reduction on the partition of the reported and unreported the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

The evolution of the COVID-19 epidemy in China is considered for validation purposes, by taking the first part of the dataset to estimate parameters, and retaining the rest of the evolution data for direct comparison with the predicted results, with excellent agreement. Then, the same approach is applied to the Brazilian case, this time employing the available time series so far for the parametric estimates, and then offering an evolution prediction. Also, some public health intervention measures are critically examined, in addition to those already implemented, permitting the inspection of their impact on the overall dynamics of the disease proliferation. Clearly, a combination of public health interventions can offer a considerable impact reduction on the disease progression within Brasil, as illustrated by the implemented modelling. It was also analyzed the negative impact due to the scarcity of testing kits during a period, which if not solved and even incremented, would lead to an increase on the ratio of unreported to reported symptomatic cases, and consequently on a dramatic epidemic evolution.

If different prior probability densities are assumed for the parameters, the posterior probability distribution may not allow an analytical treatment. In this case, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are used to draw samples of all possible parameters, and thus inference on the posterior probability becomes inference on the samples [8-9]. The main merit of the MCMC method is about providing a picture of the posterior distribution, without solving the mathematical integrals in Bayes' rule. The idea is to approximate the posterior distribution by a large collection of samples of values. This method is especially suitable when it is unfeasible to yield an analytical solvable posterior distribution and/or a large space of parameters is",

The remaining data for the initial conditions, 0 and 0 , and the early stage transmission rate, 0 , are in fact recalculated from within the MCMC algorithm, since the changing values of 0 will affect them, according to eqs. (7.c-e). The average times in the model were taken as 1/\u03bd= 6.21 days and 1/\u03b7= 11.28 days, which were obtained from the MCMC simulation on the full dataset for China, as discussed in the previous section. Also, the Brazilian government took isolation measures starting on N=21 days. Then, the statistical inverse problem analysis was employed to estimate the three parameters, 0 , , and 0 , again assuming there is still no significant time variation in the function f(t) ( = 0). Once more, in the absence of more informative priors, uniform distributions were employed for all three parameters under estimation.Table 4presents the estimated values and 95% confidence intervals for the three parameters. It is clear that the transmission rate attenuation factor, , is much less pronounced in the Brazilian case, in comparison to the China data behavior, which is possibly due to mild public health measures of isolation, or low overall adhesion to more severe proposed sanitary measures, at this early phase of the epidemic evolution.",

The time variable transmission rate is then computed from: in the accumulated reported and unreported cases, as shown in Figure 8, are quite significant. The predicted number of unreported symptomatic infectious cases is now much lower reaching after 150 days around 67,360 individuals, while the reported cases should reach 28,947 individuals, with an impressive reduction to a total of around 96,307 infectious cases.

This is simulated here by reducing the identified transmission rate attenuation factor, by assuming, after day N2=40, half the value of here identified, thus around, 2 =0.0277. The changes in the accumulated reported and unreported symptomatic cases, as shown inFigure 9, are marked changed to worse. The predicted number of unreported infectious cases is now much lower reaching after 150 days around 147,815 individuals, while the reported cases should reach 63,521 individuals, with a drastic increase to a total of around 211,336 infectious cases.

For instance, increasing the fraction of reported and unreported infectious cases parameter, to become = 0.7185, the value previously obtained from the China dataset. Therefore,Figure 10shows the behavior of both CR(t) and CU(t), which according to the value of = 0.5, occurring after the day Nf=40, leads to the crossing of reported and unreported cases that can be observed. The predicted number of unreported infectious cases is now reaching, after 150 days, around 40,894 individuals, while the reported cases should reach 60,531 individuals, with an also marked reduction to a total of around 101,425 infectious cases. The predicted evolution of the daily reported infectious cases would then show a peak at around t=47 days of about 2,341 reported cases. Although this peak value is higher than for the base case (1,067), before further public health intervention, a number of these are of mild symptomatic cases that were moved from the unreported to the reported cases evolution, thus isolated earlier.",
