While numerous works have provided projections of the progression of the pandemic, very little work has been focused on its progression in Africa and South Africa, in particular. In this work, we calibrate the susceptible-infectedrecovered (SIR) compartmental model to South African data using initial conditions inferred from progression in Hubei, China and Lombardy, Italy. The results suggest two plausible hypotheses -either the COVID-19 pandemic is still at very early stages of progression in South Africa or a combination of prompt mitigating measures, demographics and social factors have resulted in a slowdown in its spread and severity. We further propose pandemic monitoring and health system capacity metrics for assisting decision-makers in evaluating which of the two hypotheses is most probable.",

Specifically, following [10, 11] who suggest that reported confirmed cases represent between 0.2% and 1% of the total infected population. Thus we scale up the confirmed cases reported on 05/04/2020 using correction factors from Hubei, China and Lombardy Italy [10] . We further assume an infectious period of 14 days as suggested by [1] and explore basic reproductive numbers of 2,3,4 inline with related literature [1, 4, 9] . ",
