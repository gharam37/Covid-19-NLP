Since it is 158 unclear how many viral particles in droplets (virus/\u00b5m 3 ) or surfaces (virus/cm 2 ) are needed to 159 acquire COVID-19, we assumed that any droplet on a surface area of 56.75cm 2 (an 8.5-cm diameter 160 agar plate) renders a surface infective. Since textiles prevented droplets from reaching beyond a 161 ~30-cm radius, we propose a working 'droplet reduction model' to control COVID-19, where EDB-162 masks could reduce the 'circumferential area of contamination' around each individual by 97.2% 163 when used as single-layers, or as much as 99.7% when used as two-layers.
