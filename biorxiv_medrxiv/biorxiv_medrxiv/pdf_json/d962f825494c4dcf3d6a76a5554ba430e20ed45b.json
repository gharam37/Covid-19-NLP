We analyzed 320 whole-genome sequences and 320 spike protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 using multiple sequence alignment tools. In this study, 483 unique variations have been identified among the genomes including 25 nonsynonymous mutations and one deletion in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Among the 26 variations detected, 12 variations were located at the N-terminal domain and 6 variations at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which might alter the interaction with receptor molecules. In addition, 22 amino acid insertions were identified in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with that of SARS-CoV. Phylogenetic analyses of spike protein revealed that Bat coronavirus have a close evolutionary relationship with circulating SARS-CoV-2. The genetic variation analysis data presented in this study can help a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Based on our findings, potential inhibitors can be designed and tested targeting these proposed sites of variation.",

The virus causing COVID-19 is named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Based on the phylogenetic studies, the SARS-CoV-2 is categorized as a member of the genus Betacoronavirus, the same lineage Interestingly, S glycoprotein is characterized as the critical determinant for viral entry into host cells which consists of two functional subunits namely S1 and S2. The S1 subunit recognizes and binds to the host receptor through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) whereas S2 is According to recent reports, neutralizing antibodies are generated in response to the entry and fusion of surface-exposed S protein (mainly RBD domain) which is predicted to be an cleavage site (PRRAR\u2193SV) at S1/S2 boundary in S glycoprotein which could play roles in viral pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [17] . To date, few genomic variations of SARS-CoV-2 are reported [ [18] , [19] ]. There is growing evidence that spike protein, a 1273 amino acid long glycoprotein having multiple domains, possibly plays a major role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Viral entry to the host cell is initiated by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 head. Upon receptor-binding, proteolytic cleavage occurs at S1/S2 cleavage site and two heptad repeats (HR) of S2 stalk form a six-helix bundle structure triggering the release of the fusion peptide.",

Among the 483 variations, 40 variations (14 synonymous, 25 non-synonymous mutations and one deletion) were observed in the region of ORF S that encodes S glycoprotein which is responsible for viral fusion and entry into the host cell [34] . Notable that, most of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were deposited from the USA (250) and China (50) ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Positional variability of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was calculated from the MSA of 320 SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes as a measure of Entropy value (H(x)) [35] . Excluding 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR, ten hotspot of hypervariable position were identified, of which seven were located at ORF1ab (1059C>T, 3037C>T, 8782C>T, 14408C>T, 17747C>T, 17858A>G, 18060C>T) and one at ORF S (23403A>G), ORF3a (25563G>T), and ORF8 (28144T>C) respectively.

The remaining 15 variants were mutated with the amino acids that are similar in charge (Fig. 4 A) . Fig. 3) . The S2 subunit of spike protein, especially the heptad repeat region 2, fusion peptide domain, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic tail were found to be highly conserved in the SARS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2 variants while the S1 subunit was more diverse, specifically the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD). [38] , [39] , [40] ]. Likewise, a number of studies targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been undertaken for the therapeutic measures [41] , but the unique structural and functional details of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are still under scrutiny. We also found a variant (R408I) at receptor binding domain (RBD) that mutated from positively charged Arginine residue to neutral and smaller sized Isoleucine residue (Fig. 4 I) . This change might alter the interaction of viral RBD with the host receptor because the R408 residue of SARS-CoV-2 is known to interact with the ACE2 receptor for viral entry [42] . Similarly, alterations of RBD (G476S, V483A, H519Q, and A520S) also could affect the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with other molecules which require further investigations. QIA98583 and QIS30615 variants were found to have an alteration of Alanine to Valine (A930V), and Aspartic acid to Tyrosine (D936Y) respectively in the alpha helix of the HR1 domain. Previous reports have indicated that HR1 domain plays a significant role in viral fusion and entry by forming helical bundles with HR2, and mutations including alanine substitution by valine (A1168V) in HR1 region are predominantly responsible for conferring resistance to mouse hepatitis coronaviruses against HR2 derived peptide entry inhibitors [43] . This study hypothesizes the mutation (A930V) found in that of SARS-CoV-2 might also have a role in the emergence of drug-resistance virus strains. Also, .

SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with a genome size of approximately 29.9 kb encoding 27 proteins from 14 ORFs including 15 non-structural, 8 accessory and 4 major structural proteins. Two-thirds of the viral RNA harbours the first ORF (ORF1ab) dedicated for translating polyprotein 1a (pp1a) and polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab), which later undergo proteolytic cleavage to form 15 non-structural proteins. Spike glycoprotein (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) are the four major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 [[6],[7]].",

Among all the variations, twelve (Y28N, T29I, H49Y, L54F, N74K, E96D, D111N, Y145Del, F157L, G181V, S221W, and S247R) were located at N-terminal domain (NTD). Another 6 variations (A348T, R408I, G476S, V483A, H519Q, A520S) were found at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) while only two variations (A930V, and D936Y) were found at heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain. Single variations were found in signal peptide (L5F) domain, sub-domain-2 (D614G), sub-domain-3 (A1078V), heptad repeat 2 domain (D1168H), and cytoplasmic tail domain (D1259H) each. Notable that substitution of Cystine by Phenylalanine was observed at 19 amino acids upstream of the fusion peptide domain (Fig. 4A). The mutation of Aspartic acid to Glycine at position 614 was observed 71 times with entropy value over 0.5 among the available 320 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences (Supplementary",

The insertion of 17 additional amino acid residues in the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 and its high sequence diversity suggests that it may have a role in binding with other cell receptors in humans. This is because the Nterminal domain could function as the receptor-binding domain of various coronaviruses [[34],[36]]. Similar phenomenon has been observed in mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) where the N-terminal domain is reported to be attached with the host entry receptor [48,49]. The variation analyses in amino acids indicated the structural features of different domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. However, to identify the actual role of involvement of S glycoprotein, a larger dataset regarding genomics and proteomics of SARS-CoV-2 is required as this protein is vital to understand the viral pathogenicity, evolution and development of therapeutics. Further analyses of all the S glycoprotein and SARS-CoV-2 genomes with different epidemiological aspects is warranted to get the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.",
