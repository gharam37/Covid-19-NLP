            "text": "To analyze SARS-CoV-2 structure (reference Wuhan strain MN908947.3), we employed CROSS 12 105 to predict the double-and single-stranded content of RNA genomes such as HIV-1 13 . We found the 106 highest density of double-stranded regions in the 5' (nucleotides 1-253), membrane M protein 107 (nucleotides 26523-27191), spike S protein (nucleotides 23000-24000), and nucleocapsid N protein 108 (nucleotides 2874-29533; Fig. 1 ) 26 . The lowest density of double-stranded regions were observed 109 at nucleotides 6000-6250 and 20000-21500 and correspond to the regions between the non-110 structural proteins nsp14 and nsp15 and the upstream region of the spike surface protein S (Fig. 1) 111 26 . In addition to the maximum corresponding to nucleotides 23000-24000, the structural content of 112 spike S protein shows minima at around nucleotides 20500 and 24500 (Fig. 1) . 113 We used the Vienna method 27 to further investigate the RNA secondary structure of specific 114 regions identified with CROSS 13 . Employing a 100 nucleotide window centered around CROSS 115 maxima and minima, we found good match between CROSS scores and Vienna free energies (Fig.  116 1). Strong agreement is also observed between CROSS and Vienna positional entropy, indicating 117 that regions with the highest structural content have also the lowest structural diversity. 118 119 Our analysis suggests the presence of structural elements in SARS-CoV-2 that have evolved to 120 interact with specific human proteins 11 . Our observation is based on the assumption that structured 121 regions have an intrinsic propensity to recruit proteins 14 , which is supported by the fact that 122 structured transcripts act as scaffolds for protein assembly 15, 16 . Using Clustal W for multiple sequence alignments 28 , we observed general conservation of the 155 coding regions (Fig. 3A) . The 5' and 3' show high variability due to experimental procedures of the 156 sequencing and are discarded in this analysis 29 . One highly conserved region is between 157 nucleotides 23000 -24000 in the spike S genomic locus, while sequences up-and downstream are 158 variable (red bars in Fig. 3A) . We then used CROSSalign 13 to compare the structural content 159 (Materials and Methods). High variability of structure is observed for both the 5' and 3' and for 160 nucleotides between 21000 -22000 as well as 24000 -25000, associated with the S region (red bars 161 in Fig. 3A) . The rest of the regions are significantly conserved at a structural level (p-value < 162 0.0001; Fisher's test). 163 164 We then compared protein sequences coded by the spike S genomic locus (NCBI reference 165 QHD43416) and found that both sequence (Fig. 3A) and structure (Fig. 2) of nucleotides 23000 -166 24000 are highly conserved. The region corresponds to amino acids 330-500 that contact the host 167 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 30 promoting infection and provoking lung injury 168 24,31 . By contrast, the region upstream of the binding site receptor ACE2 and located in 169 correspondence to the minimum of the structural profile at around nucleotides 22500-23000 ( Fig. 1 ) 170 author/funder.

            "text": "In order to obtain insights on how the virus replicates in human cells, we predicted SARS-CoV-2 184 interactions with the whole RNA-binding human proteome. Following a protocol to study structural 185 conservation in viruses 13 , we first divided the Wuhan sequence in 30 fragments of 1000 nucleotides 186 each moving from the 5' to 3' and then calculated the protein-RNA interactions of each fragment 187 with catRAPID omics (3340 canonical and putative RNA-binding proteins, or RBPs, for a total 188 102000 interactions) 18 . Proteins such as Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 PTBP1 (Uniprot 189 P26599) showed the highest interaction propensity (or Z-score; Materials and Methods) at the 5' 190 while others such as Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q HNRNPQ (O60506) showed the 191 highest interaction propensity at the 3', in agreement with previous studies on coronaviruses (Fig. 192 4A) 35 . 193 194 For each fragment, we predicted the most significant interactions by filtering according to the Z 195 score. We used three different thresholds in ascending order of stringency: Z \u00b3 1.50, 1.75 and 2 196 respectively and we removed from the list the proteins that were predicted to interact promiscuously 197 with more than one fragment. Fragment 1 corresponds to the 5' and is the most contacted by RBPs 198 (around 120 with Z\u00b32 high-confidence interactions; Fig. 4B ), which is in agreement with the 199 observation that highly structured regions attract a large number of proteins 14 . Indeed, the 5' 200 contains multiple stem loop structures that control RNA replication and transcription 36,37 . By 201 contrast, the 3' and fragment 23 (Spike S), which are still structured but to a lesser extent, attract 202 fewer proteins (10 and 5, respectively), while fragment 20 (between orf1ab and Spike S) that is 203 predicted to be unstructured, does not have binding partners. 204 author/funder.

The regions containing the highest amount of structure 343 are the 5' as well as glycoproteins spike S and membrane M. 344 345 We found that the spike S protein domain encompassing amino acids 330-500 is highly conserved 346 across SARS-CoV-2 strains. This result suggests that spike S must have evolved to specifically 347 interact with its host partner ACE2 30 and mutations increasing the binding affinity are highly 348 infrequent. As the nucleic acids encoding for this region are enriched in double-stranded content, 349 we speculate that the structure might attract host regulatory elements, thus further constraining the 350 variability. The fact that the Spike S region is highly conserved among all the analysed SARS-CoV-351 2 strains suggests that a specific drug can be designed against it to prevent interactions within , the highly variable region at amino acids 243-302 in spike S protein corresponds to the 355 binding site of sialic acids in MERS-CoV (see manuscript by E. Milanetti et al.) 7,10,34 and could 356 play a role in infection 33 . The fact that the binding region changes in the different strains might 357 indicate a variety of binding affinities for sialic acids, which could provide clues on the specific 358 responses in the human population. Interestingly, the sialic acid binding site is absent in SARS-CoV 359 but present in MERS-CoV, which represents an important difference between the diseases. 360 361 Both our sequence and structural analyses of spike S protein indicate high conservation among 362 coronaviruses and suggest that human engineering of SARS-CoV-2 is highly unlikely. 363 364 Using catRAPID 18,19 we computed >100000 protein interactions with SARS-CoV-2 and found 365 previously reported interactions such as Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 PTBP1, 366",

In general, proteins associated with retroviral 380 replication are expected to play different roles in SARS-CoV-2. As SARS-CoV-2 massively 381 represses host gene expression 46 , we hypothesize that the virus hijacks host pathways by recruiting 382 transcriptional and post-transcriptional elements interacting with polymerase II genes and splicing 383 factors such as for instance La-related protein 7 LARP7 and A-kinase anchor protein 8-like 384 AKAP8L. The link to proteins previously studied in the context of HIV and other viruses, if 385 confirmed experimentally, is particularly relevant for the repurposing of existing drugs 64 . 386 387The idea that SARS-CoV-2 sequesters different elements of the transcriptional machinery is 388 particularly intriguing and is supported by the fact that a large number of proteins identified in our 389 screening are found in stress granules 62 . Indeed, stress granules protect the host innate immunity 390 and are hijacked by viruses to favour their own replication 66 . Moreover, as coronaviruses 391 transcription uses discontinuous RNA synthesis that involves high-frequency recombination 40 , it is 392 possible that pieces of the viruses resulting from a mechanism called defective interfering RNAs 70 393 could act as scaffold to attract host proteins 14,",

High structural variability (red 668 bars on top) is observed for both the UTRs and for nucleotides between 21000 and 22000 as well as 669 24000 and 25000, associated with the S region. The rest of the regions are significantly conserved 670 at a structural level.
