In search of the effective prevention and treatment for COVID-19, some researchers found that there was a strong correlation between the heath effect of COVID-19 and national policy for Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), a vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) disease. Miller et al. (2020) found that both morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 are associated with early adoption or universal coverage of BCG vaccination, while Giovanni Sala and Tsuyoshi Miyakawa (2020) found that BCG vaccination slowed down the spread or progression of symptoms rather than reduced COVID-19 death. Shet et al. (2020) also examine the correlation with mortality. In the middle of global pandemic, the BCG hypothesis has quickly attracted the attention of popular media outlets such as Bloomberg (March-30-2020) and New York Times (April-5-2020) . Another study by Zhang et al. (2013) further indicates that the BCG strain with fewer epitopes deleted, such as the Japan and Russian/Bulgarian strain, are more likely to be effective due to higher and more frequent responses, although this paper is not about COVID-19. Clinical trial for these BCG strains are now initiated in several countries (For example, see Medical News Today (April-2-2020)).",

For example, a country with higher BCG vaccination coverage is more likely to be poor as infectious diseases (such as TB) are still leading causes of death. Such country is less likely to be connected to the major economic regions such as China, Europe, and the United States due to their trade openness and geographic location. There is an imminent need to re-examine this newly emerging hypothesis for two reasons. If there is no possibility, the society should spend more effort searching for more plausible solutions to combat COVID-19. Moreover, if people demand BCG vaccination for COVID-19, this creates a shortage for BCG vaccination for children who actually need it. In fact, Japan BCG Laboratory, the only producer of BCG vaccine in Japan, shipped three times more vaccine in March 2020 than the average in the past. 1 The Japan Society for Vaccinology recently warned that BCG vaccination was for preventing TB, not for other purposes in their official statement. 2 We believe that clinical trials can provide us with a secure basis for the effectiveness of BCG vaccination against COVID-19, but it is worth reexamining this purported hypothesis using a more credible identification strategy before spending more time and resources to test it. In this paper, we test this hypothesis with a best available identification strategy based on observational data: a regression discontinuity and difference-in-difference analysis.",

If a comprehensive health care reform is implemented simultaneously with the introduction of a universal BCG policy, then this assumption is violated. However, any bias should occur in the same direction with the expected BCG effects, producing an upward bias. In this paper, we demonstrate that even with this potential upward bias, we do not observe any improvement in the COVID-19 infection rate at the age of policy change.",

In 1978, the strain changed from English/Japan to French. Thus, we can study the effects at three distinct time boundaries: 1945 (i.e. 1960 minus 15) when people covered by the campaign were born, 1960 when the vaccination was introduced, and 1978 when the strain changed. In the Czech republic, BCG vaccination was introduced in 1953 for people under 18 (Tu et al., 2012) , and stopped universal vaccination in 2010 (Va\u0161\u00e1kov\u00e1, 2013) .

In 1987, they changed from the Danish to the Japan strain. Between 1987 and 1991, they revaccinated at age 7. We study the effects at 1977 and 1991.

In (e) Singapore, there is no significant decrease after coverage (77 years old), and the start of the vaccination policy (62 years old). In summary, results from regression discontinuity analysis do not support either the positive BCG effects, or the stronger BCG effects with the Japan and Russia/Bulgaria strains. Some argue that the effect of BCG lasts only for 20 to 30 years and hence would not be detected at old cohorts. However, the apparent no effect at the age of termination of the universal vaccination policy in the Czech Republic in 2010 would address this issue. Figure 2 displays the results of the difference-in-difference analysis. The Figure's left panel shows the scatter plot of residualized log cases per thousand and the residualized BCG coverage ratio after controlling for country and age-group dummies from Model (1). If the BCG reduces COVID-19 infection, we should expect a negative slope: however, here the slope is positive, indicating that our results do not support the purported BCG effects on COVID-19 infection. The right panel of Figure 2 shows the scatter plot of residualized log cases per thousand and the residualized BCG coverage with the Japan or the Russia/Bulgaria strains. The highlighted circles represent Japan, Thailand, Colombia, and Latvia where the Japan or Russia/Bulgaria strains were once used. Again, we do not observe a negative slope: therefore, our results do not support the hypothesis that the Japan and the Russia/Bulgaria strains that are close to the original Tuberculosis are especially effective. This difference-in-difference analysis includes cohorts for which the universal BCG vaccination coverage terminated during 1990s and 2000s. Thus, the result also addresses the problem that potential BCG effects last only for 20 to 30 years. Note that when we remove the country fixed effects, the sign of the coefficient becomes significantly negative, consistent with the previous cross-country analysis of Miller et al. (2020) . This underscores the importance of controlling for unobserved country-specific characteristics.",

BCG immunization can still prevent from developing symptoms or reduce death once infected by COVID-19. However, given that those with COVID-19 symptoms and their close contacts are more likely to be tested and confirmed, we still capture some effects of BCG immunization on developing symptoms. Second, there is possibility that population (in addition to individual) immunity affects our COVID-19 outcomes. However, we removed out potential population immunity effects of the BCG vaccination by controlling for country-specific unobserved fixed effects. We agree that population immunity effects are another parameter of policy interest. However, we leave this to the future research. Another potential criticism is that people acquired immunity from the actual infection of TB, rather than the BCG immunization. If the effects of the BCG immunization and TB on the COVID-19 infection are the same and the TB infection rate was almost 100% around the 5 change in the vaccination policy, there is a possibility that we failed to pick up any additional effects of the BCG immunization. However, this is implausible. Marks et al. (2018) document that in Vietnam, only around 30-40% of age 30s and 40-50% of older population are infected by TB in 2016. In Thailand, the infection rate of children under 14 years old in 1977, when the vaccination started, was 15.2% (Sriyabhaya et al., 1993) . Since Thailand and Vietnam are among the highest TB burden countries in the sample we study, 4 we view these numbers as upper-bounds. There is also possibility that actual immunization rate did not reflect policy change, but this is also implausible given that BCG vaccination coverage rapidly increased from around 0 to 100% when a universal vaccination policy was introduced, as in Vietnam. Hence, if any BCG-specific effect exists, it should appear at the age of policy change. ",
