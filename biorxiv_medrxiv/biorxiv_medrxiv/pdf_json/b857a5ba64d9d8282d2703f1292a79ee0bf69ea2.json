For controlling the spreading of the virus, we have to prepare for precaution and futuristic calculation for infection spreading. The coronavirus affects the population of the world including Inia. Here, we are the study the virus spreading rate on the Maharashtra state which is part of India. We are predicting the infected people by the SIR model. SIR model is one of the most effective models which can predict the spreading rate of the virus. We have validated the model with the current spreading rate with this SIR model. This study will help to stop the epidemic spreading because it is in the early stage in the Maharashtra region.",

The first case was observed 9 march 2020 in Maharashtra [10] where the couple was returned from Dubai. In India, the first case was observed on 30 January 2020 [11] . At 12 march, world health organization (WHO) announce that COVID 19 is outbreak of pandemic where the term used by disease experts when epidemics are growing in multiple countries and continents at the same time [12] . In current situation, after 12 march corona virus cases are rapidly increase in India and there are several cases also observed in the Maharashtra.

After reaching the peak point the recovery will be more and the virus infection will be high for R ~ 2.66. This study is considered only 7000 population are migrating in the state which can be affected in the lockdown condition. If the migrated population will increase which causes the increment of infection and infect the population more. This can control by the lockdown situation only which is presently imposed by the Governments to the people.
