There are widespread reports of dwindling supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), which are paramount to protect frontline medical/nursing staff and to minimize further spread of the virus. We carried out a rapid review to summarize the existing evidence on SARS-CoV-2 survivorship and methods to disinfect PPE gear, particularly N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFR). In the absence of data on SARS-CoV-2, we focused on the sister virus SARS-CoV-1. We propose a two-step disinfection process, which is conservative in the absence of robust evidence on SARS-CoV-2. This disinfection protocol is based on an initial storage of PPE for \u22654 days, followed by ultraviolet light (UVC), dry heat treatment, or chemical disinfection. Importantly, each of the two steps is based on independent disinfection mechanisms, so that our proposed protocol is a multiplicative system, maximising the efficacy of our disinfection process. This method could be rapidly implemented in other healthcare settings, while testing of each method is undertaken, increasing the frontline supply of PPE, and avoiding many of the upstream issues of supply chain disruption currently being faced.",

In the case of SARS-CoV-2, it has been estimated that 3.2% of patients in China required intubation 5 . Evidence from the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic show that doctors and nurses involved in the early critical care period and endotracheal intubation of patients were more than 13 times more likely to acquire SARS-CoV-1 infection themselves 6 . Given this results in a significant loss of highly specialised healthcare workers in an already strained workforce, avoidance of cross contamination is critical in all health care settings.",

Coordinating the supply chain of PPE in the midst of an epidemic with many closed borders and reduced freight is challenging. Individual behaviour becomes a factor when people are scared or ill-informed 7 , theft of PPE can occur, and local supply chain issues mean that inappropriate use of PPE happens due to lack of supply, despite best-practice guidance on its use 2 . A call for ideas on conserving PPE was made through JAMA on 20 March 2020 8 . One recommendation was reusing PPE. Given the ability of this to rapidly increase supply issues close to the frontline avoiding many of the upstream disruption to the supply chain, this rapid evidence summary was prepared, aiming in particular at the re-utilization of the usually disposable N95 FFRs during the current epidemic. A whole-of-PPE solution has been developed within this protocol, which would be able to be rapidly set up in many healthcare settings.",

While the applied dose is easy to measure experimentally, the received dose is not. If there are shadowing or absorption effects from the surrounding medium, the actual dose reaching the virus will be lower. \u2022 The penetration of UV across the multiple layers of an N95 FFR may vary from one model and manufacturer to another 25 . There is some limited evidence that the majority (approximately 90%) of captured aerosols occurs on the outer filter layer on an N95 FFR 26 . Therefore, providing a larger UV dose on the outside surface may be desirable. \u2022 Overall, the effective applied dose is unclear, but appears to be high in comparison to other viruses. \u2022 Mills et al.

It is intended that results of protocol testing will be made available as soon as feasible.
