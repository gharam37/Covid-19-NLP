With no vaccine available and numerous national healthcare systems reaching or exceeding capacity, interventions to limit transmission are urgently needed. While there is broad agreement that travel restrictions and closure of non-essential businesses and schools are beneficial in limiting local and regional spread, recommendations around the use of face masks for the general population are less consistent internationally. In this study, we examined the role of face masks in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in the general population, using epidemic models to estimate the total reduction of infections and deaths under various scenarios. In particular, we examined the optimal deployment of face masks when resources are limited, and explored a range of supply and demand dynamics. We found that face masks, even with a limited protective effect, can reduce infections and deaths, and can delay the peak time of the epidemic. We consistently found that a random distribution of masks in the population was a suboptimal strategy when resources were limited. Prioritizing coverage among the elderly was more beneficial, while allocating a proportion of available resources for diagnosed infected cases provided further mitigation under a range of scenarios. In summary, face mask use, particularly for a pathogen with relatively common asymptomatic carriage, can effectively provide some mitigation of transmission, while balancing provision between vulnerable healthy persons and symptomatic persons can optimize mitigation efforts when resources are limited.",

Such measures are designed to minimize person-to-person exposures, reducing the effective reproduction number R 0 , and thus the growth rate of the epidemic. Furthermore, behavior such as social distancing, self-isolation while symptomatic, handwashing, disinfecting surfaces and hygienic etiquette around coughing and sneezing can further mitigate transmission on an individual level. Interventions such as these can offer protection (reduction in risk of infection) to susceptible individuals, and/or containment (reduction in risk of onward transmission) to infected individuals. While such measures are near universally encouraged by governments and public health departments, there is limited international consensus on the use of face masks among the general public. Face mask use is common in East and South East Asia, and is currently recommended by the government in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan for healthy persons in crowded public spaces, as well as for symptomatic persons in Japan and Singapore [7, 8] . Face mask use was compulsory in public in Wuhan, China, during public lockdown at the height of the epidemic. In contrast, the WHO does not currently recommend mask use among the general population [9] , and the US government did not [10] until April 3, 2020, at which point cloth face coverings were recommended by the CDC [11] . There is a growing recognition across Western countries that face mask use should be part of public health policy for mitigating the spread of Covid-19. Recently, the Czech Republic made it mandatory to cover the nose and mouth in public [12] , while Austria required the use of face masks in supermarkets [13] .",

While no studies to date have examined the effectiveness against transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the mechanisms of transmission via droplet and direct contact are likely highly similar to better characterized viruses. A cluster randomized household study examined the effectiveness of surgical and P2 (N95) masks in preventing transmission of influenza-like illness, finding a significant reduction associated with compliant mask use, although most participants failed to adhere to mask use sufficiently to see a benefit [14] . Cowling et al. showed that mask use and handwashing implemented within 36 hours of a case diagnosis could significantly reduce secondary household influenza cases (odds ratio 0.33) [15] . Mathematical models have also suggested that the number of influenza A cases can be reduced significantly even if just a small proportion of the population wear masks [16] . A systematic review on physical interventions to limit transmission of respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, concluded that face mask use was effective [17] . In particular, N95 masks were slightly, but not significantly, more effective in reducing transmission than surgical masks, but were less comfortable to wear and caused skin irritation, potentially leading to lower compliance. Generally, the theoretical protective effect of masks may be diminished by a number of factors. Compliance and effective use may be inadequate [14] , masks may not be replaced frequently enough to prevent contamination [18] , and finally, Covid-19 infection may even occur via alternative routes, such as ocular transmission [19] .",

Surgical and N95 masks limit and redirect the projection of airborne droplets [21] , and surgical mask wearing is estimated to be associated with a reduction in overall viral aerosol shedding [22] and coronavirus [23] . While diseases with a large proportion of symptomatic cases may result in most carriers reducing personal contacts (by choice or incapacity), Covid-19 is thought to have a high proportion of mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic cases, and therefore more infectious persons unaware of their status may continue to expose others. As such, even if masks offer limited personal protection, a general recommendation to wear masks in public may be particularly beneficial by containing transmission from unknowingly infectious persons.",

Infections progress to pre-symptomatic (I P ) in which a person is infectious, but exhibiting no symptoms, and then either mildly symptomatic/asymptomatic (I A ) or symptomatic (I S ), similar to the model structure described by Anderson et al. [6] . Infected persons in either category can then recover (R), or if symptomatic, may die (D). Each compartment is partitioned into those wearing masks, and those not. Masks reduce susceptibility to infection in healthy individuals; mask wearers' susceptibility relative to non-wearers is denoted r s , where r s =0 represents a fully protective mask. Similarly, masks are assumed to decrease transmissibility in infectious persons; a mask wearer has a relative transmissibility of r t , with r t =0 representing a mask completely restricting onward transmission. For convenience, we also define the terms 'protection' and 'containment' as 1-r s and 1-r t , respectively, and use 'mask effectiveness' to refer to these properties collectively.",

Estimates for the proportion of asymptomatic cases vary considerably; including 18% based on data from the Diamond Princess cruise ship (with a high proportion of elderly people) [28] , 25% according to the director of the US CDC [29] , 30% based on Japanese evacuees from Wuhan [30] , and even up to 78% based on limited reporting from China [31] . Given the importance of this parameter in determining allocation of resources, we allowed this parameter to vary over a plausible range. Mild/asymptomatic cases are assumed to have an infection rate 50% lower than fully symptomatic cases. While there is currently limited evidence on the progression of infection in different age groups, we assumed that the proportion of asymptomatic cases in the elderly (70+) was half the proportion in the younger population, and that the death rate among symptomatic elderly cases was 9.7%, versus 1.3% in younger cases [32] .

Unsurprisingly, regardless of demand dynamics, a higher production rate of masks increased availability and therefore coverage of the population. Figure S4 shows the reduction in total infections given different levels of protection and mask production, highlighting that a greater number of less effective masks were required to achieve the same impact as fewer, but more effective, masks. For a given level of mask production, a 'panic buying' scenario, in which maximum demand for masks was attained very early in the epidemic, generally had a detrimental impact on the resulting outbreak ( Figure S5 ). Unless production is ramped up during the outbreak, an inability to build a stockpile of available resources prevents infected persons obtain masks readily during peak transmission ( Figure 5, left) . In contrast, a more gradual With a supply of masks for 40% of the population, resources are provided under each of the strategies described in Methods. The reduction in infections and deaths under the optimal strategy is shown in the right column, relative to the numbers under the na\u00efve strategy. The area shaded in gray represents complete suppression of the outbreak under the optimal strategy. Here we assume the probability of asymptomatic carriage to be 0.3 among cases <70y.",

The benefits of mask deployment are apparent even with low effectiveness and limited resources. In such cases, though mask deployment may not have a large impact on total cases and deaths, indirect benefits for outbreak management are achieved by delaying the epidemic peak. Importantly, however, the overall impact of mask deployment hinges on appropriate distribution strategies. We consistently observed that the random distribution of masks throughout the general population is a suboptimal strategy. In contrast, prioritizing the elderly population, and retaining a supply of masks for identified infectious cases generally leads to a larger reduction in total infections and deaths than a na\u00efve allocation of resources. While there remains much uncertainty around the true effectiveness of face masks -especially when factoring in differences in mask types, levels of adherence and patterns of human behavior -there is evidence to suggest that masks can provide a measure of protection and containment for respiratory viruses, likely a greater degree of the latter than the former.",

Under a strategy in which masks are retained for infectious persons, this is particularly important. As a higher proportion of infectious persons -both symptomatic and asymptomatic (and possibly unaware of their status as a carrier) -are wearing masks offering a high level of containment, a smaller number of onward transmissions occur, requiring fewer masks to be provided for newly diagnosed individuals. While mask use can help to mitigate transmission, the supply & demand model suggests that panic buying at the very early phase of an epidemic can be detrimental, and that managing demand in the early stages of the outbreak could be beneficial. In Taiwan, the government implemented such a resource management strategy in early February 2020, limiting the number of masks each person can buy per week with their National Health Insurance cards [25] . As human behavior and compliance are a significant component of how effective mask use is, it is essential that public health recommendations concerning face masks in the general population occur in tandem with clear education on proper use and application, such that limited resources are used as effectively as possible.",

Our models concern the distribution of resources in the general population, under the assumption that healthcare workers and key personnel have adequate protection -clearly it is essential that this subpopulation should have prioritized access to protective equipment. However, if production can be increased such that face masks may be available to the general population, an optimized deployment of these resources can limit spread. While we considered the elderly population in our model, we did not explicitly consider other vulnerable subpopulations, such as immunocompromised persons or those with other respiratory conditions. Such persons with increased risk of suffering severe infections, and perhaps more importantly, those interacting with them, should belong to the prioritized subpopulation we considered in the resource allocation. In addition, we did not consider heterogeneity in population mixing. In reality, there are clusters of particularly vulnerable persons (e.g. hospitals, nursing homes, long term care facilities, prisons, homeless shelters) which pose an elevated risk; failing to protect such communities could lead to rapid and highly localized spread. It is likely that face mask use is also more beneficial in populations with higher contact rates. Future modeling work could consider meta-populations of different population densities to optimize resource deployment in urban vs. rural settings.",
