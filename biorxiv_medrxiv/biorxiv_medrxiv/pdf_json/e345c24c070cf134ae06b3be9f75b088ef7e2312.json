The understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic is of great interest for the governments and health authorities that are facing COVID-19 outbreaks. The scarce presence of epidemiologic data, due to the still ongoing outbreaks, makes prediction difficult and mainly based on heuristic (fitting) models. However, these models with non-physical based parameters, can only give limited insight in the evolution of the outbreaks. In this work a SIRD compartmental model was developed to describe and predict the evolution of the Chinese and Italian outbreaks. Exploiting the similarities of the measures taken by the governments to contain the virus and of the total population number of Hubei province and Italy, the model was tuned on the Chinese outbreak (almost extinguished) and by perturbation the Italian outbreak was describe and predicted.",

COVID-19 symptoms are often (80%) mild [2] , may appear 2-14 days after exposure (mean incubation period 5-6 days) [2] , and include fever, cough and shortness of breath [3] . However the 13.8% of infected have severe disease and the 6.1% are critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure) [2] . Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical disease may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks [2] . In the severe and critical disease, the patient admission to intensive care unit (ICU) is necessary and the mechanical ventilation (artificial assistance to support breathing), may be required [4] . This special treatment is the bottle neck of most of the health care systems, which are not prepared to deal with the numbers of patients that the COVID-19 disease could produce. Therefore, measures of containment of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks are essential to not overstress the health care systems and to manage the pandemic.",

These drastic measures, also adopted by other EU countries, apart from the health sector, have a dramatic impact on the global economy as well as on the lifestyle habits of millions of people. Epidemiologic descriptions and predictions could help in the understanding of the dynamic of the COVID-19 disease, supporting governments and health authorities in the resources allocation [5] . Most of the models proposed until now to describe the COVID-19 outbreaks, due to the scarcely data available of a still ongoing epidemic, are heuristic models. These models are \"fitting\" equation, exponential [5] or logistic [6] , used to describe the infection data, whose parameters have scarce (or none) physical meaning and their use for prediction, especially at long term, should be avoided. On the contrary compartmental models could constitute the right trade-off between the need of having physical based parameters, the easiness of solution and the scarce presence of data in the evolving epidemic. Typically, the population of interest is subdivided into a small number of compartments based on infection status (e.g. susceptible, infectious or recovered) and the flows between these compartments are described by ordinary differential equations [7] . Aim of this work is to develop a compartmental model (SIRD) to describe first the Chinese COVID-19 epidemic and then, by perturbation of the model parameters, to describe and predict the Italian COVID-19 epidemic.",

The most important parameter, which causes the retardation of the decreasing phase of the epidemic is the characteristic time % in the infection kinetic. The higher % , the longer it will take to reduce the number of cases (the longer it will take to reach \u211b ! <1). In Figure 7 the impact of the variation of % is reported on incident cases. With the blue solid thick line the \"best fit\" value (used in this work) is reported. However, as it can be seen from the experimental data, the epidemiologic data are prone to be describe with other characteristic time of infection % , especially higher than the present \"best fit\" value.

The ongoing outbreaks are often described with simple fitting models, i.e. exponential functions (and/or sigma-shaped curves such as Logistic or Gompertz), whereas in this work, a SIRD compartmental model was developed and used to describe and predict the evolution of the Chinese (Hubei) and of the Italian outbreaks. The advantages of SIRD models with respect to heuristic models reside mainly in the physical-based SIRD parameters, which can give useful insight and/or can be properly chosen on the basis of physical-based assumptions. The present SIRD model was able to describe the outbreaks, obtaining the kinetic of infection, the kinetic of recovery as well as the kinetic of death. The Italian best fit initial kinetic of infection was lower (half) than the Chinese one, probably because the Italian outbreaks are mainly based in small hospitals/cities, whereas the main Chinese outbreak was in the metropolitan city of Wuhan. However, the decrease time of this kinetic in the Italian outbreak was slower than in the Chinese outbreak, probably due to the delayed lockdown and initial weaker restrictions. Therefore, despite a lower average \u211b ! , 3.9 in Italy versus 8.3 in Hubei, the longer Italian epidemic produced much more COVID-19 cases.",

In particular, since the least squares approaches relies on the fitting of independent data, the use of the cumulative data should be avoided: cumulative incidence data are highly correlated. On the contrary the use of the daily new infection, daily recovery and dailydeaths (incident cases) should be preferred, since these data are independent. However, these data are more scattered with respect to cumulative data and the ordinary least squares (OLS) which is highly sensitive to outliers, could generate misleading results.

According to the released data at the end of the outbreak less than 70,000 people were infected by the SARS-CoV-2, and the 95% recovered. However, the Chinese government is recalculating the cases, as it can be seen from the last points in Figure 2 C-D): the deaths were increased of 1,290 people and the recovered decreased of 910 units (on the 17 th of April), reducing the recovery percentage at the 93%. The Italian outbreak after the initial fast-growing phase, has reached the peak of incident infection at the end of March but with numbers way higher than the Hubei outbreak. On the 17 th of April 172,400 cases of COVID-19 were reported with 22,740 deaths and \"only\" 42,730 recovered patients. There is a strong debate on the problem of underestimating cases, especially related to the Chinese data but, also related to the impossibility of tracking worldwide (also in Italy) the SARS-CoV-2infections that produce COVID-19 with mild symptoms.

This result can be explained considering that at the beginning of an epidemic the most severe cases are reported, displaying higher lethality, which tends to decrease when new cases less severe are added.Moreover it can be explained considering that the treatments were improved as well as considering a parameter not directly accounted in this model: the relation between lethality and patience age[16].

The population of the Hubei province and Italy is also roughly the same: 60 million. The main Italian lockdown was performed on the 11 th of March, when the cases were already 10590 (against the 438 on the 23 rd of January in China). To account for this delay, the equations for the description of the Italian outbreak were slightly adjusted for ( ) and ( ). constant rate for the number of contacts per person and also a constant kinetic of death before the date of lockdown (between the 26 th of February and the 11 th of March). After the lockdown both the function decrease exponentially due to the isolation of people (reduction of ) and especially for categories that are at greatest risk of death (reduction of ). The modeling results obtained are reported in Figure 5. The epidemiologic data are well described with the optimization of only five adjustable parameters. Indeed, on the contrary of the Hubei outbreak, the model was able to describe the Italian epidemiologic data with only a parameter (\u03b3 ! ) for the kinetic of recovery. Moreover, on the experience of the Chinese outbreak, the long-term death kinetic was set to zero (\u03b4 & = 0). The model parameters obtained are reported in Table 1 and in Figure 6 A). Most of the kinetic data are in agreement with the findings of [21]. According to the model prediction the Italian outbreak on the 17 th of April is on the peak region, 42 days (3\u03c4 : ) after the lockdown.
