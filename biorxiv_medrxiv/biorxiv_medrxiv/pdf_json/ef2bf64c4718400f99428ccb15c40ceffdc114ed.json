Prior estimates of R 0 have varied widely and 14 range from 1.95 to 6.49. Utilizing meta-analysis techniques we determined 15 a more robust estimation of 3.05 for R 0 , which is substantially larger than 16 that provided by the WHO. We also present the infectious rate standardized 17 to per million population, which has proved to be a good index to determine 18 whether the isolation measures in specific countries are effective. Also, this 19 standardized infection rate can be used to determine whether the current 20 infectious severity status is out of range of the national health capacity. Fi-21 nally, we utilize our robust estimate of R 0 and the standardized infectious 22 rate to illustrate that the early and aggressive isolation measures enforced 23 by the Chinese government were substantially more effective in controlling 24 the negative impact COVID-19 than the more permissive measures enacted 25 early in Italy and the United States.",

Also, this standardized infectious rate per million 123 population also allows us to compare the intervention effects of COVID-19 across 124 countries.

Therefore, we discuss the relationship 126 between the healthcare capacity and the peak of the infectious rate in Section 3.

Also, the peak of the infection rate can be delayed or reduced after 91 the government intervention by reducing the effective reproductive number R t , 92 and accordingly, it reduces the strain on healthcare systems which are set to run 93 at near-capacity in absence of an epidemic. 94 Therefore, the above epidemic scenarios motivated us to investigate the ef-95 fectiveness of the isolation policy across different countries from real data since 96 it is important for public health to identify effective measures of prevention for 97 COVID-19 spread. This study has three purposes. First, since estimates of R 0 98 range widely (1.95 to 6.47) in the existing literature, we sought to utilize meta-99 analyses to determine a more robust estimate for R 0 . Second, we standardized 100 the infectious rate to per million population as a more conducive comparison of 101 the distribution of COVID-19 and to more readily show how the infectious rate is 102 beyond the maximum of the health system capacity in some countries. Third, we 103 can show how the relative success of China isolation policy to control the effective 104 reproductive number from the statistical model based on real data. To this end, 105 the results can supply some useful guidelines for controlling the rapid spread of 106 COVID-19 in the world. The rest of this article is organized as follows.

There are several reasons for 279 the Chinese successful isolation policy. Firstly, laboratory testing such as nucleic 280 acid testing and CT scans have been widely applied in China, which was helpful 281 for the identity and the isolation of COVID-19 patients at the right time and the 282 right place. The timely screening of suspected COVID-19 patients can reduce 283 the peak of the infectious rate of COVID-19, and then can reduce the burdens of 284 the health care system in the whole country. Secondly, the large scale and severe 285 exclosure policies were carried out to isolate infected people and quarantine their 286 contact with healthy people.
