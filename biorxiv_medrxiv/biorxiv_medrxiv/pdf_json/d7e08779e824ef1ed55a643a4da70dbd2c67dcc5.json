The proposed setting allows to investigate how a specific intervention scenario affects the dynamics of the epidemics, with particular attention to interactions between individuals of the same or different age groups (children, adults and people older than 60y). \u2022 A most undesirable scenario (do-nothing scenario), where the only control measures are increased awareness due to media activities (washing hands, proper coughing and sneezing, keeping distance from obviously sick persons), according to the mathematical model would lead to a peak in the curve of diagnosed cases at the end of April 2020, with about 2.8 Mio active detected cases on the day of the peak, a total of 80 Mio infected (out of which only about 8 Mio detected and 23.5 Mio asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections), and a total of 630,000 fatalities over the course of the epidemic. This is in line with what was predicted for the outbreak in the United Kingdom in an analogous do-nothing scenario [4]. \u2022 Hitherto adopted main control measures (incl. closure of schools and universities, remote working policy, isolation of infected cases and maintenance of testing activity as of March 2020) have then been included in the mathematical model to fit the curves of reported cases in Germany as of March 25th. The maintenance of these measures until the end of 2020 was assumed to predict the \"baseline\" (BSL) scenario. Model simulations indicate that, compared to the do-nothing scenario, where no interventions are applied, the BSL scenario would lead to: (i) a shift in the epidemic peak by about one month (expected in early June 2020), (ii) a reduction of detected SARS-CoV-2 infections by 60% (from 2.8 Mio to 1.26 Mio) at the outbreak peak, (iii) a reduction by about 100,000 fatalities (expected over 530,000 fatalities in total) and (vi) about 69 Mio infected (thereof 20 Mio asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections) over the course of the epidemic.",

We present here the preliminary results of a mathematical study directed at projecting possible modifications and improvement of control measures in Germany. The developed mathematical models allow to study the spread of COVID-19 among the population in Germany and to asses the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions. The overall goal is to suggest strategies for the mitigation of the current outbreak, slowing down the spread of the virus and thus reducing the peak in daily diagnosed cases, the demand for hospitalization or intensive care units admissions, and eventually fatalities. The project was developed in the framework of a newly established collaboration on \"Epidemiology and Pandemics\" between Heidelberg University, the Frankfurt Institute of Advanced Studies and the J\u00fclich Supercomputing Center.",

According to the model, these interventions, if starting immediately and going into full effect within five to ten days seem to reduce the number of fatalities to a minimum of 18,000 and the peak number of infectives to 660,000 active detected infections at the day of the peak in the third week of April. However, this dramatic slowdown of the epidemic comes with a price since successfully preventing new infections also slows down the increase of the number of recovered, and hence immune, individuals. For this scenario to work effectively, all the above mentioned strict control measures (including BSL measures) must remain in effect for more than one year.",

Simulations indicate that the favorable effects of the restrictions imposed to date would be substantially reversed, leading to a comparable scenario as the do-nothing scenario, with an epidemic peak around mid May 2020, 2.2 Mio diagnosed cases on the day of the peak and 620,000 fatalities over the course of the epidemic. If, however, this is accompanied by significantly increased testing activity, isolation of identified cases and reduced contact with vulnerable individuals, such a partial withdrawal leads to less severe consequences. Indeed, model simulations of this scenario indicate that the (first) epidemic peak would be reached due to increased testing activity in the second half of April 2020, with 670,000 detected SARS-CoV-2 infections at the outbreak peak. A second peak would follow and the epidemic would last for a longer period (more than one year), but the total number of cases (14.4 Mio, out of which there are 1.2 Mio asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections) and fatalities (about 60,000) would be substantially limited by the measures according to the model.",

While the advantage of a temporary shutdown is buying time (the expected peak being mid July 2020 with 1.3 Mio identified cases at the day of the peak), which might be helpful if the health care systems can be prepared to be in a better position to deal with the disease, such a scenario would still lead to about 570.000 fatalities in total, as the model predicts. If accompanied by increased test activity this scenario leads to similar fatality numbers (258,000) and even higher peak numbers of known infected individuals (22.6 Mio) as compared to a scenario with increased testing alone as additional measure. The main effect of a shutdown with abrupt start and end would be delaying the peak of known active cases, while at the same time making it narrower and higher.",

The expansion of testing capacities by a factor of 10 alone already results in a reduction of fatalities by about 50% as compared to the baseline (result not shown in figures). Clearly, increased testing will result in a higher number of diagnosed cases, increasing the peak number of known infectives by a factor of two (Fig. 6b, Fig. 6c ), but it is important to keep in mind that the additional identified cases should be expected to be mostly weakly symptomatic. The expected peak number of patients requiring hospitalization is reduced by more than 30%, and the same is true for patients requiring intensive care (result not shown in figures). ",

These interventions, if starting immediately and going into full effect within five to ten days (Table 2) , promise to reduce the number of fatalities by a factor of about 30 (18,000   expected deaths, Fig. 6c) and the peak number of infectives by a factor of two (660,000 active detected infections at the day of the peak Fig. 6b) This leads us to consider two more scenarios which include an at least partial lifting of the restrictions imposed thus far. We assume this to start around Easter (April 12th, 2020), including reopening schools, universities, and restaurants, resuming normal work and most club activities, and at least some resurgence in travel. Without any further intervention, this lifting of measures alone (scenario RB-HO-CS) is expected to result in an increase of some 15% of the death toll over the baseline scenario (Fig. 6d) , probably even more pronounced by a presumably overwhelmed health care system having to sustain an even higher peak number (Fig. 6b) of infectives compared to the baseline scenario. However, combining this partial rollback with significantly increased testing activity, isolation of identified cases and reduced contacts with endangered persons (Scenario RB-IO-IC-T1+) reduces the expected number of fatalities by a factor of nine (Fig. 6d ) and the peak number of known infectives by a factor of two (Fig. 6b) , again many more of them only weakly afflicted than in the baseline scenario. Even stricter isolation of cases but less severe restrictions on endangered persons (scenario RB IC+ IO-T1+) still results in reductions by a factor of six for fatalities ( Fig. 6d ) and close to 40% for the maximal number of simultaneously active known infectives (Fig. 6b) .",

Firstly, there is significant uncertainty regarding the current number of undetected cases and therefore the current detection ratio. This clearly affects any assumptions on possible increases of that ratio. In scenarios without additional testing (T0), the total number of infectives at a given time is supposed to be tenfold higher than the number of known cases. Assuming increased testing (T1), the factor reduces to 1.7, while for vastly increased testing (T1+) also of asymptomatic individuals we assume that only 25% of infectives remain undetected, meaning that the number of infectives at a given time is 1.35 times the number of known active cases.",

Using antibody tests, as far as available, in addition to direct PCR tests for viral RNA will have the additional benefit of identifying recovered, and hence presumably immune individuals who can then resume their normal levels of activity without jeopardizing any efforts to contain the epidemic. That even the most optimistic scenarios results in more than ten thousand fatalities and very high numbers of cases is a result of the assumption that the detection ratio is still rather low, albeit increasing, and the presumed number of infectives at the current point in time is already rather large. Any significant increase in testing is therefore going to reveal a large number of infected individuals already present but still in the dark. However, the prospect of reducing the number of fatalities by possibly 90% or even more should be a good reason to strongly consider the proposed measures.",

Compared to a scenario without the application of interventions, the maintenance of the baseline measures until the end of 2020 leads to a reduction in about 100.000 fatalities and a reduction of number of detection at the outbreak peak by 60% (from 2.8 Mio to 1.26 Mio.). In light of these results and considering that the current restrictions on public life are hard to sustain in the long run, we are led to simulate several scenarios based on possible further nonmedical interventions (cf. Table 2). Among these interventions are massive expansions of testing for infections both among symptomatic (T1) and increasingly among asymptomatic persons (T1+), even stricter isolation of identified cases (IC, IC+), increased caution in contact by and with endangered individuals to different extents (IO, IO-), and finally a close to total shutdown (SD) of economic activities, as it was successfully exercised in Hubei province in China. Moreover, we investigate the effects of at least a partial rollback of the measures being currently imposed, specifically reopening schools, universities and some organized social activities (RB-CS) on the one hand, and vastly reduced restrictions of economic activities (RB-HO) on the other hand.

It should be remarked that the current restrictions (BSL) on public life were assumed to remain largely in effect in this scenario.
