            "text": "Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are used to test patients and key workers for infection with the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus. RT-PCR tests are highly specific and the probability of false positives is low, but false negatives can occur if the sample contains insufficient quantities of the virus to be successfully amplified and detected. The amount of virus in a swab is likely to vary between patients, sample location (nasal, throat or sputum) and through time as infection progresses. Here, we analyse publicly available data from patients who received multiple RT-PCR tests and were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive at least once. We identify that the probability of a positive test decreases with time after symptom onset, with throat samples less likely to yield a positive result relative to nasal samples. Empirically derived distributions of the time between symptom onset and hospitalisation allowed us to comment on the likely false negative rates in cohorts of patients who present for testing at different clinical stages. We further estimate the expected numbers of false negative tests in a group of tested individuals and show how this is affected by the timing of the tests. Finally, we assessed the robustness of these estimates of false negative rates to the probability of false positive tests. This work has implications both for the identification of infected patients and for the discharge of convalescing patients who are potentially still infectious.",

We couple this with data on the observed distribution of days from onset of symptoms to confirmation of infection by RT-PCR [11] and use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the number of false-negatives in different cohorts of tested individuals, under the assumption that they are only tested once; and assess the sensitivity of these results to the specificity of the test. Our results have implications for both existing estimates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and the likelihood of specific individuals having been infected with the virus or not, where these rely solely on RT-PCR tests.",

Overall this illustrates 3 important things: that for a zero or very small false-positive test probability, the true number of infected individuals among those tested will be substantially larger than the number of positive tests; that increasing false-positive test probabilities start decrease these estimates until they eventually go negative (even for quite small values of the false-positive test probability); and that such decreases are more severe in situations where the apparent prevalence among those tested is lower.",

Presently, RT-PCR testing regimes vary significantly between countries, determined both by policy decisions and testing capacity. Some opt (or, rather, are able to) test large portions of the population, including those who are asymptomatic or self-isolating with mild symptoms. In countries such as South Korea, where testing has been thorough, the distribution of test timing will be crucial; if many of those tested were infected some time ago but only had mild or asymptomatic infections (and therefore did not present for treatment), they will be more likely to return a false negative result. In countries that do not currently have mass testing, there are calls for testing to be expanded to the population at large with the aim of determining how many people have, or have recently had, infection. While RT-PCR testing of key workers will be of great importance (particularly those working with vulnerable groups), our results suggest that there may be some benefit to testing indiscriminately; conducting a single test on someone who had symptoms 10 days ago will have a nearly 33% false negative rate (using a nasal swab; 52.89% for a throat swab). As a means of determining population level exposure to SARS-CoV-2, serological tests are far more likely to provide an accurate profile.",

In the absence of other testing procedures, this has implications for clinical decisions about treatment, and decisions about who needs to be quarantined or can be released safely into the community. We also illustrate how, assuming that the false positive test probability is negligible, the count of positive tests underestimates the count of infected individuals in a group of tested individuals, which in turn has implications for estimates of case and infection fatality risks in the wider population. However, if the false-positive test probability is non-zero, then values as low as 0.5% -1% could mean that the true prevalence among those tested is lower than suggested by the naive count of positive tests.",

On the other hand, a recent Italian study offered evidence that, among those testing positive, viral loads were equivalent in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals [19] . This does not show, however, that viral loads are the same in both groups, but that they are equivalent conditional on a positive test, which is what we might expect if the probability of a positive test is indeed linked to viral load. If this is true, then it could be that many asymptomatically infected individuals are asymptomatic because their immune system managed to check viral replication early on in their infection and viral loads sufficient to result in a positive test were not achieved. If true, however, this might be difficult to square with the apparent transmission potential of asymptomatic individuals [20] .

Note that the realised error rate (the actual proportion of false negative tests) will be proportional to the underlying prevalence of infection; only if everyone in the group is infected would the probability of a false negative equal the proportion of negative tests (as there will be no true negatives from uninfected individuals).",

In fact, for some critical (yet small) value for the false-positive test probability, the estimated number of infections becomes smaller than the number of positive tests: we end up with more false-positives than false-negatives. Moreover, the false positive test probability has a bigger impact on the 'South Korean' data because a smaller percentage of the original tests were positive (this follows directly from the underlying derivations -see Supplementary Methods).",
