Decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 by four different methods. A) SARS-CoV-2 on N95 fabric 56 and stainless steel surface was exposed to UV, 70 \u00baC dry heat, 70% ethanol and vaporized hydrogen 57 peroxide (VHP). 50 \u00b5l of 10 5 TCID 50 /mL of SARS-CoV was applied on N95 and stainless steel (SS). 58 Samples were collected at indicted timepoints post exposure to the decontamination method for UV, heat 59 and ethanol and after 10 minutes for VHP. Viable virus titer is shown in TCID 50 /mL media on a 60 logarithmic scale. All samples were quantified by end-point titration on Vero E6 cells. Plots show 61 estimated mean across three replicates (dots and bars show the posterior median estimate of this mean and 62 the posterior inter-quartile range, or IQR). Lines show predicted decay of virus titer over time (lines; 50 63 random draws per replicate from the joint posterior distribution of the exponential decay rate, i.e. negative 64 for use under a CC0 license. of the slope, and intercept, i.e. initial virus titer).

B) Mask integrity. 66 Quantitative fit testing results for all the decontamination methods after decontamination and 2 hours of 67 wear, for three consecutive runs. Data from six individual replicates (small dots) for each treatment are 68 shown in addition to the predicted median and IQR (large dots and bars respectively) fit factor. Fit factors 69 are a measure of filtration performance: the ratio of the concentration of particles outside the mask to the 70 concentration inside. The measurement machine reports value up to 200. A minimal fit factor of 100 (red 71 dashed line) is required for a mask to pass a fit test. C) SARS-CoV-2 decontamination performance.
