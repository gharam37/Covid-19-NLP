The relative contribution ratio of each transmission route is largely undetermined, which is affected by environmental conditions, human behavior, the host and the microorganism. In this study, a detailed mathematical model is developed to investigate the relative contributions of different transmission routes to a multiroute transmitted respiratory infection. It is illustrated that all transmission routes can dominate the total transmission risk under different scenarios. Influential parameters considered include dose-response rate of different routes, droplet governing size that determines virus content in droplets, exposure distance, and virus dose transported to the hand of infector. Our multi-route transmission model provides a comprehensive but straightforward method to evaluate the transmission efficiency of different transmission routes of respiratory diseases and provides a basis for predicting the impact of individual level intervention methods such as increasing close-contact distance and wearing protective masks.

Second, we establish a more advanced simulation model to describe the infection via different routes considering the physical components of particles and droplets movement, differences in possible viral dose-effect as well as human-behavior factors such as touching mouth and nose. We use influenza as an example due to the large number of related studies for extracting modelling parameters. Using the model, we aim to challenge the traditional dichotomous thinking of close contact transmission vs airborne (aerosol) transmission via highlighting the scenarios under which each transmission route may dominate and how environmental and behavior factors interact in the transmission mechanism.",

However, such definitions are somewhat ambiguous. Firstly, the cut-off size of droplets for airborne transmission has always been controversial (8, 22, 23) . The droplet nuclei, first defined by Wells (24) , refers to the residues of droplets after complete evaporation. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined the cut-off size of 5 \u00b5m for airborne transmission (25) , and the threshold distance for airborne transmission is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as 1.0 m (26).",

Using an airborne cut-off size of =5 \u00b5m, about 60% of respiratory droplets generated ( 0 =15 \u00b5m) can be evaporated and suspended in the air and introduce long-and short-range airborne infection, which is largely underestimated in other studies.",
