[4] [5] [6] [7] We tested for association between treatment with ACEi or ARB and disease severity in the first 205 patients with COVID-19 disease admitted to a multi-site acute NHS Trust in the United Kingdom (King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust).

Only patients symptomatic and requiring inpatient admission were included. The primary endpoint was defined as death or admission to a critical care unit for organ-support within 7 days of symptoms onset (symptoms defined as fever, cough, dyspnoea, myalgia, chest pain or delirium). Patients were stratified according to drug exposure to ACEi or ARB within 7 days before symptoms or during inpatient treatment (prior to an endpoint being reached). Specifically, we divided the total cohort into patients with prescription and/or mention in any text record of (1) ACEi (Ramipril, Perindopril, Lisinopril, Enalapril, Captopril, Quinapril, Imidapril, Fosinopril, Trandolapril) and (2) ARB ( Candesartan, Irbesartan, Losartan, Olmesartan, Telmisartan, Valsartan) up to 7days before or after symptom onset. We considered patients whose medication was withheld during admission as positive for drug exposure. Patients with no medication orders or clinical documents created in the study period (because never admitted) were excluded. One newborn was also excluded. The primary endpoint was manually verified by a clinician review of the electronic health record.",

DrugPipeline was used to annotate medications and MedCAT produced unsupervised annotations for all SNOMED-CT concepts under parent terms Clinical Finding, Disorder, Organism, and Event with disambiguation, pre-trained on MIMIC-III. 12 Further supervised training improved detection of annotations and meta-annotations such as experiencer (is the concept annotated experienced by the patient or other), negation (is the concept annotated negated or not) and temporality (is the concept annotated in the past or present ) with MedCATTrainer. Meta-annotations for hypothetical and experiencer were merged into Irrelevant meaning that any concept annotated as either hypothetical or where the experiencer was not the patient was annotated as irrelevant. Performance of the MedCAT NLP pipeline for disorders mentioned in the text was evaluated on 138 documents by 4 annotators (TS, ZK, DB, AS) and F1, precision and recall recorded. Additional full case review for correct subsequent diagnosis assignment was performed by 3 clinicians (JT, KOG, RZ) for key comorbidities: Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, Heart Failure and Ischaemic Heart Disease. Performance of DrugPipeline has previously been described. 9 All detected drug mentions were manually reviewed to exclude false positives (e.g. allergy).",

We have mitigated against this by manually validating annotations in a subset of records and also verified ACEi and ARB annotations against inpatient electronic prescription data. Moreover, we have performed sensitivity analyses to test the impact of different criteria to define the ACEi exposed cohort on our results, finding that although not significant the OR remained <1.0 for ACEi exposure in all analyses. The lack of significance in the more strict analyses is likely due to the loss of power as some detections of ACEi medication are excluded. For the less strict analysis, the lack of significance may be due to noise introduced (e.g. prescription halted before the study period). The NLP output in the less strict analysis is also not manually reviewed and is highly likely to contain some irrelevant mentions e.g. previous allergic reaction.
