We divide infectious individuals into asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals. The symptomatic infectious phase is also divided into reported (severe symptoms) and unreported (mild symptoms) cases. In fact, there exists a period for the cumulative number of reported cases to grow (approximately) exponentially in the early phase of virus transmission which is around the implementation of the national prevention and control measures. We firstly combine the date of the implementation of the measures with the daily and cumulative data of the reported confirmed cases to find the most consistent period for the cumulative number of reported cases to grow approximately exponentially with the formula \u03c7 1 exp(\u03c7 2 t) \u2212 \u03c7 3 , thus we can determine the parameters \u03c7 1 , \u03c7 2 , \u03c7 3 in this formula and then determine the parameters and initial conditions for our model by using this formula and the plausible biological parameters for SARS-CoV-2 based on current evidence. We then provide the epidemic predictions, evaluate the effectiveness of control measures by simulations of our model.",

It is evident that our estimates and simulations have shown good correspondence with the distribution of the cumulative data available of the reported confirmed cases for each country and in particularly, the curves plotted by using different parameter groups (d 1 , d 2 , N ) for reported and unreported cases tend to be consistent in China and South Korea (see (e) in Figures 2-3 ).

Our prediction also relies on the cumulative data of the reported confirmed cases. Using multiple groups of parameters (d 1 , d 2 , N ), we have attempted to make the best possible prediction using the available data. We found that with more cumulative data available, the curves plotted by using different parameter groups (d 1 , d 2 , N ) for reported and unreported cases will be closer and closer, and finally tend to be consistent. This shows that when we have no enough cumulative data available, we need to use all possible parameter groups to predict the range of turning point, the final size of reported and unreported cases. When we have enough cumulative data, for example, when we get the data after the turning point, we only need to use any one of these parameter groups to get a prediction with high accuracy. ",

Research [9] traced COVID-19 infections which resulted from a business meeting in Germany attended by someone infected but who showed no symptoms at the time and found that four people were ultimately infected from that single contact. It has also been confirmed that asymptomatic transmission occurs in [1] which echoes the report in [9] . A German research team [11] showed that some new crown pneumonia patients had higher viral levels in the throat swabs during the early stage of the disease, that is, when the symptoms were mild. It is reported in [7] that 13 evacuees from Wuhan, China on chartered flights were infected, of whom 4, or 31%, never developed symptoms. The estimated asymptomatic proportion in [6] is at 17.9% which overlaps with a derived estimate of 31% from data of Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan [7] . A team in China [10] suggests that by February 18, there were 37,400 people with the virus in Wuhan whom authorities didn't know about. The asymptomatic and mild symptomatic cases were missed because authorities aren't doing enough testing, or 'preclinical cases' in which people are incubating the virus but would not be ill enough to seek medical help, would probably slip past screening methods such as temperature checks. The asymptomatic and mild symptomatic cases are just going to be really crucial for us to understand the rapid transmission.",

Our model also incorporates government and social distancing measures, through the time-dependent transmission rate. Based on the values of f, \u00b5, N in Table 2 , it is evident that the strong government measures such as isolation, quarantine, and public closings, should start as early as possible, and should be as strong as possible. After a first outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, South Korea came back to linearly growing phase now. It seems that this epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 is not easy to eradicate.

We see that our model agrees very well the data for China and South Korea. Compared to China and South Korea, the public interventions in Italy, France, Germany and United Kingdom were relatively late. The peak of the epidemic occurs in Italy around March 24, and the peak of the maximum daily number of cases in our simulation is approximately 5 500, which agrees well with the daily reported cases data for Italy.

For Italy, we can see from Figure 4 that these curves are very close to each other since we have the data after the turning point. But for France, Germany and United Kingdom, these curves could not tend to be consistent with the data available now. This shows that when we have enough cumulative data available, for example, when we get the data after the turning point, we could use only one of these parameter groups to get the prediction with high accuracy. When we have a few cumulative data available, we need to use all possible parameter groups to predict a range for the turning point, the final size of cumulative reported and unreported case and the daily reported case. It is evident that we used plausible biological parameters f, \u03bd, \u03b7 for SARS-CoV-2 based on current evidence which might be refined as more comprehensive data become available. Our prediction also relies on the cumulative reported data. The prediction becomes better and better as more data become available. Using multiple groups of parameters (d 1 , d 2 , N ), we have attempted to make the best possible prediction using the available data.
