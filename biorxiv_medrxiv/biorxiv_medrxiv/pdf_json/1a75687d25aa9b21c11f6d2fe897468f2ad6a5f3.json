As 13 the genome of these virus exist in RNA form, only by profiling the relative abundance of these sgRNAs, can 14 the viral transcriptome be revealed. Utilizing publically available meta-transcriptomic data generated from 15 patient samples, we were able to infer the viral transcriptome in vivo, which is distinct from the in vitro one 16 derived from cell culture. Inter-sample diversity was also observed and a sample specific transcript was 17 identified. By doing the same analysis to MERS and SARS data, we were able to compare the three in terms 18 of transcription. Among the differences, SARS-COV-2 has significantly elevated expression of the Spike gene, 19 which may contribute to its high transmissibility. 20 21 Highlights 22 1) The in vivo transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 revealed by sgRNA profiling, for 25 patient samples around 23 the globe. 24",

In short, 73 reads were first aligned to a combined reference of human (hg38) and either SARS-CoV-2 (GeneBank ID 74 It's followed by ORF7a, M, ORF3a and S, all just above 10%. E is the lowest of the eight at about 1%. All of 84 them also have TRS except E. The break point for these ORFs were situated between 9 to 146 nt upstream 85 of the ORF start, and have no start codon (ATG) in-between. ORF7b and ORF10 are two ORFs that were 86 supported in a recent proteomics study on SARS-CoV-2. However, we did not see supporting break 87 points/sgRNA in our first scan-through. We then looked extra hard by lowing our threshold. The few extra 88 break points emerged were still very far away from those ORF start or has out-of-frame start codon between 89 the break point and the ORF start. Thus ORF7b and ORF10 were not supported by our data, this could be 90 1.6% and 1.25% respectively. We notice this difference is in accordance with the three's capability to spread 122 among hosts: MERS being the most deadly, has a R0 of 0.69, SARS-CoV-2 having the lowest fatality rate, 123 spread very rapidly and SARS comes in between in terms of both transmissibility and fatality rate [10-12]. 124 SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV both use ACE2 as the receptor for celluar invasion. Cryo-EM study suggested 125 that the SARS-CoV-2 has higher binding affinity to ACE2 [13]. Our study suggest yet another possibility. The 126 elevated S expression, may make an average SARS-COV-2 having more Spikes on surface or just assemble 127 more efficiently. 128",

This could make 130 biological sense as in defenseless cultured cells, viruses devote more resource into reproduction, while to 131 cope with more host defense in vivo, accessory genes have to more important roles to play. This also 132 suggested there was intricate expression regulation mechanism at work here, even for this small 30 Kb 133 genome. 134 Finally, there are more than just viral information within this type of meta-transcriptomic data. Host 164 RNA and RNA from other microbes were also there, though not optimally captured.

Like other coronaviruses, the genome of SARS-COV-2, the 33 virus responsible for COVID-19, exists in the form of a single positive strand of RNA. Upon entrance into 34 host cells, the open reading frame (ORF) closest to 5' end can be readily translated from the genome, in 35 reality this ORF is divided into two segments-ORF1a and ORF1ab, due to a ribosome skipping mechanism 36 involved [2]. All other 3' ORFs, including ones coding for the structural proteins: S (Spike), E (Envelope), M 37 (Membrane) and N (Nucleocapsid) and a number of accessory genes, can only be translated by first forming 38 the so called sub-genomic RNAs or sgRNAs. These sgRNAs are formed by recombination of the 3' portion 39 of the genome with a leader sequence of around 70 nt. The recombination is usually thought to be based 40 on a repetitive sequence called Transcription Regulation Sequence (TRS), Fig 1A.41",

I.e. the reads 76 that derive from the 5' end of the sgRNAs, when mapped to whole genome reference, will have one end 77 mapped to the 5' leader and one end mapped far away from it, Fig 1A. See supplementary methods for 78 more details. 79 For SARS-CoV-2, there are 25 samples in total, between 2.99% and 99.97% of the reads were mapped 80 to SARS-CoV-2 (84.76% average, the large variation arose from different sequencing library construction 81 methods used). The sgRNA profiling identified 8 cannonical break points corresponding to 8 sgRNA species: 82 S, E, M, N, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a and ORF8, Fig1B.

This break point was only 93 identified in one of the samples but reached high frequency in it. Interestingly, this novel break point has 94 an underlying TRS that's shifted several bases from the canonical one and all the samples contain this 95 shifted TRS. The underlying sample (SRA ID SRR11278164) has a genomic sequence differs from other 96 samples mostly at ORF1ab, suggesting replication/transcription machinery change rather than TRS 97 alteration contributed to this novel sgRNA.

The number of 3' ORFs annotated by homology alone is 12 while sgRNA profiling 110 suggest 8, Suppl. Fig 1.

When the 113 annotation of the 3 viruses were compared, both homology based and sgRNA based, SARS comes closest 114 to SARS-CoV-2, as expected. Also, sgRNA evidence suggest both express 8 3' ORFs, with an almost perfect 115 correspondence, with ORF8 from SARS-CoV-2 being the exception.

This is an under-utilization of a valuable information. By developing 153 an informatics pipeline, we were able to infer the sgRNA populations from these data, essentially recover154 the viral transcriptome.

Our result show that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike gene is highly 159 expressed in at least a large number of virus strains, on average an order of magnitude higher than SARS-160 CoV or MERS-CoV.

Also in the 21 century, 43 two previous episodes of coronavirus outbreaks had plagued us: the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory 44 Syndrome) outbreak in 2003 and MERS (Mid-Eastern Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in 2012. These two 45 outbreaks caused far fewer cases, 8071 and 2499 respectively, whereas the fatality rates were much higher, 46 9.6% for SARS and 37.0% for MERS, compared with a current estimate of 4.5% for SARS-COV-2 [1, 3, 4]. 47 Studying the difference between the three can reveal valuable information on their different 48 transmissibility and virulence. But it's currently lacking beyond clinical information or simple genome 49 comparison due to the difficulty in handling these deadly viruses. 50 Sequencing has played essential role in identifying this particular virus and are still contributing to the 51 diagnosis and strain typing to keep the spread and evolution of it under close monitoring [5, 6]. The vast 52 majority of these sequencing data come in the form of meta-transcriptomics sequencing, i.e. the 53 sequencing of the RNA of all organisms within a biological sample, mostly bronchoaveolar lavage fluid or 54BALF. Usually the viral reads within these data were extracted and assembled or used to call SNPs, so the 55 underlying strain would be typed and compared to existing ones. Once sequenced, early annotation of the 56 viral genome were made based on sequence homology [5, 6]. However, homology alone does not warrant 57 expression of the underlying gene as these highly mutable RNA virus can have other sequence features 58 altered that rendering ORFs that looked intact not expressed. Recently, direct profiling of viral RNAs were 59 made using nanopore technology that revealed the transriptome of the virus, these study all used isolated 60 virus strain to infect VERO cells to generate the sample for sequencing[7][8][9]. In this paper, we turned to the 61 readily available public data. By profiling the sgRNA population underlying the data using an alignment 62 break point analysis method, we were able to reconstruct viral transcriptome in vivo for a large number of 63 samples, and study their diversity. Doing the same to MERS and SARS, we were able to compare the 64 As of 2020/03/31, there are more than 2800 viral genome sequences submitted to GISAID.However 68 there are only 11 Bioprojects containing almost 60 samples with raw data deposited in NCBI SRA. After 69 filtering out samples that contained too few viral reads and adding ones for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we 70 obtained 8 projects with 42 samples and 698 million Illumina reads in total, Supplementary Table 1.
