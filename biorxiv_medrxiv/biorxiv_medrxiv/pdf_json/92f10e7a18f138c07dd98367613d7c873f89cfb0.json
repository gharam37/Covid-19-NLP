Following closely the growth dynamics of the disease is one of the pillars towards achieving that goal. Objective: We aimed at developing a simple framework to facilitate the analysis of the growth rate (cases/day) and growth acceleration (cases/day\u00b2) of COVID-19 cases in real-time. Methods: The framework was built using the Moving Regression (MR) technique and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The dynamics of the pandemic was initially modeled via combinations of four different growth stages: lagging (beginning of the outbreak), exponential (rapid growth), deceleration (growth decay) and stationary (near zero growth). A fifth growth behavior, namely linear growth (constant growth above zero), was further introduced to add more flexibility to the framework. An R Shiny application was developed, which can be accessed at",

The disease is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (2,3), which seems to have first emerged in Wuhan, China on December 12 th 2019 (4, 5) . Worldwide dissemination has been extremely rapid, and by the time this study was completed (April 2 nd 2020) a total of 928,437 cases and 46,891 deaths had been reported across 204 countries and territories according to data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) (6) . Approximately 86% of all cases are estimated to have been undocumented prior to the cordon sanitaire in China (7) , which suggests that the disease might be also substantially under-reported in other countries. Nevertheless, partial COVID-19 prevalence data are still an invaluable resource to help monitoring and controlling the disease. In particular, extracting daily estimates of growth rate (cases/day) and acceleration (cases/day\u00b2) in disease dissemination from real-time case reports can be decisive for an effective and promptly action to restrain further contagion. Here we report the development of a simple framework dedicated to the real-time analysis of COVID-19 prevalence. This framework was built using a combination of Moving Regression (MR) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and was deployed as a Shiny (8) application in R (9) . Here we show the utility of that framework in the analysis of publicly available COVID-19 case reports that are updated daily by the ECDC.",

            "text": "For simplicity, assume that the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases over time (i.e., the growth curve) in a specific country or territory follows an unknown sigmoidal function (Figure 1a) . Such assumption is common in the analysis of growth data and has been applied to a wide range of problems, from tumor (10) to bacterial (11) growth. Although empirical data from China ( Figure  1b) and South Korea (Figure 1c ) seemed to support it well, that assumption will be substantially relaxed later in our framework to accommodate complex dynamics in the evolution of COVID-19 prevalence. We define growth rate and growth acceleration as the first and second order derivatives, respectively, of the prevalence of COVID-19 in respect to time. In our framework, we selected MR to approximate these derivatives over competing models that are frequently used to describe the behavior of sigmoidal growth curves, such as the Gompertz model (12, 13) , because: (i) it is dependent on a single free parameter, the \"smooth factor\", which represents the number of neighboring days used in local regression; (ii) growth rate and acceleration estimates are approximated by ordinary least squares equations, which are computationally inexpensive; (iii) we performed extensive simulations of growth curves and found that it produces reasonably accurate estimates of growth rate (median R 2 = 0.99 with smooth factor of 3) and acceleration (median R 2 = 0.92 with smooth factor of 3) (Figure 2) ; (iv) it is very robust to departures from sigmoidal curves; and (v) it does not rely on observations of the whole curve to produce instantaneous growth rate and acceleration estimates, and thus can produce such estimates in near real time. Argument (v) is especially relevant to the analysis of COVID-19 data since the pandemic is ongoing and each country will be at a different stage of the growth curve as time passes. A clear disadvantage of MR is that it may over-fit the growth curve to the data, especially if the selected smooth factor is small (say < 3), in which case accurate prediction of new cases of COVID-19 is limited to very few days in the future. Still, even single-day predictions can be of great use during a pandemic if reasonably accurate. In the ECDC data set, a forward validation showed that single-day predictions were sufficiently accurate (R\u00b2 ~ 0.95) (Figure 3) .",

The growth rate graph is approximately bell-shaped, with its peak corresponding to the inflection of the exponential stage. This inflection point signals the beginning of a decline in the growth rate. The growth acceleration graph usually consists of a combination of two bell-shaped curves: the first one with a peak and the second with a valley. The peak indicates the point where acceleration starts descending towards zero. The moment when acceleration is exactly zero coincides with the inflection of the exponential stage, which marks the beginning of growth deceleration (i.e., negative acceleration). The latter corresponds to the entire concave section of the curve, but the very bottom of the valley indicates that the prevalence is moving towards stagnation.",

            "text": "In spite of sigmoidal curves following the four above described stages sequentially, we anticipated that the growth of COVID-19 cases may not necessarily obey this sequence in practice, since the dynamics of the disease is likely complex and highly responsive to the implementation or relaxation of public health measures. This implies that a country that has already reached a stationary stage could resume exponential growth, for example by seeding a new outbreak via importation. Likewise, decelerating countries could as well regain acceleration by relaxing prevention measures. Furthermore, some countries may face multiple cycles of acceleration and deceleration prior to reaching a stationary growth. These scenarios could produce more complex growth curves that deviate from the sigmoidal shape by mounting different arrangements of exponential, deceleration and stationary stages. Of note, MR has sufficient flexibility to model these complex scenarios and can easily accommodate curves exhibiting arbitrary permutations of these four stages. In addition, the near-zero acceleration that is intimately related to the stationary stage in sigmoidal curves could also arise from a non-zero constant growth rate in practice. In such cases, the growth curve would exhibit a linear pattern, which can be interpreted as a fifth growth stage that is not observed in classic sigmoidal functions. Such linear pattern may appear if the deceleration stage does not form an enough deep valley prior to acceleration rising up again towards zero. Again, MR is capable of modeling these anomalous behaviors. In this study we sought to ascertain whether these five stages of growth curves could have direct implications in understanding the dynamics of COVID-19 prevalence both globally and locally. We further developed a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to automate the detection of transitions between stages in the growth curve using acceleration and growth rate data obtained with MR as input (see Material and Methods).",

We also looked for countries presenting complex arrangements of the five growth stages. The countries found to have reached a near-stationary stage at some point were China and South Korea (Figure 1b-c) . By projecting official government announcements against the fitted curves of these countries, we observed that decline in growth acceleration occurred shortly after the implementation of measures that drastically reduced human movement. Deceleration of growth was achieved within 2 weeks and the prevalence plateaued within 6 weeks. These results indicated that: (i) the effect of public health measures on SARS-CoV-2 prevention can be detected in seemingly real time by monitoring the behavior of acceleration curves; and (ii) restriction to human mobility is very effective in controlling the spread of the disease, but takes several weeks to produce a stationary growth. These findings are in line with a recent study showing that human mobility explained early growth and decline of new cases of COVID-19 in China (14) . As discussed before, one should not immediately assume that a country in stationary growth will remain in that stage, since acceleration could take off again if new cases are imported or preventive measures are relaxed. In fact, our HMM classifier categorized the apparent stationary growth stage of China and South Korea as a linear growth. Indeed, both countries have not reached a perfect asymptote and their COVID-19 prevalences are instead growing in a linear pattern.",

Brazil and USA both showed brief declines in acceleration between March 20 th and 25 th , but were still found in exponential growth as of April 2 nd . In fact, Brazil resumed acceleration incline on March 26 th . Still, since acceleration response to effective measures seems rapid, both Brazil and USA could begin a deceleration process within few weeks if effective measures are implemented are rigorously followed. To date, Brazil has accumulated 6,836 cases and 241 deaths, whereas USA has recorded 216,721 cases and 5,138 deaths.",

All three countries experienced deceleration phases that did not culminate in stationary growth. Instead, a brief linear growth was formed after deceleration, which was followed by a new exponential growth stage. Estonia has further entered a new deceleration phase on March 27 th . These observations indicate that the growth dynamics of COVID-19 cases is more complex than previously appreciated. Therefore, analyzing the raw growth curve alone, dissociated from its derivatives, is very limiting for inference and may hamper the understanding of the pandemic evolution. In part, the lack of combined analysis of growth rate and acceleration in this pandemic is to be blamed on scarce availability of tailor made, user-friendly software. To aid to the analysis of growth rate and acceleration of COVID-19 cases, we built a web application using R (9) and Shiny (8) . This application automatically loads the latest ECDC case reports and applies MR to extract growth rate and acceleration from real-time data. The app also performs automated classification of growth stages with HMM (albeit free parameters should be manually tuned for improved results). Users are not limited to case reports from ECDC, since the app allows for the upload of custom data (e.g., city, region, province or state), which can be used to monitor the growth behavior of COVID-19 locally. Upon closing of the COVID-19 pandemic, this tool could be further used in the analysis of future outbreaks and epidemics, or even of historical disease data. A limiting factor however is that the proposed framework relies on updated case reports, such that sub-notification, delayed communication and the elapsed time between sample collection, diagnostic results and reporting may impact the real-time inference of growth dynamics in disease transmission and consequently jeopardize the timely detection of transitions in the growth curve. In spite of that limitation, the presented tool remains highly useful to monitor the growth behavior of epidemics.",

Considering a as the n-dimensional vector of estimated growth accelerations across n recorded days, we first compute z = sign(a), where sign(.) is a modified sign function which retrieves -1 for a < -c, +1 for a > c and 0 otherwise. Scalar c is defined as an acceleration cutoff, which is treated here as a free parameter. The objective of the HMM was to generate a sequence of states K = (k 1 , k 2 , \u2026, k n ) where each element k i takes one of the following values: \"lagging\", \"exponential\", \"deceleration\" or \"stationary\". The initial probabilities for these hidden states were set to 1, 0, 0 and 0, respectively, assuming that all growth curves start from a lagging stage. Now let T be a 4 x 4 matrix of transition probabilities between hidden states and E be a 4 x 3 matrix of emission probabilities that models the probability of each hidden state producing a z value of -1, 0 or +1. We adopted: The selected values in T only permitted transitions lagging \u2192 exponential, exponential\u2192 deceleration or deceleration \u2192 stationary. Values in E made z = 0 more likely to be produced by either the lagging or stationary stages, z = +1 more likely to be produced by the acceleration stage and z = -1 more likely to be produced by the deceleration stage. For the atypical transition deceleration \u2192 exponential, the described model would generate a short and intermediate stationary step between these two stages. In these cases, the spurious stationary step was replaced by an exponential classification after the HMM has been fitted to the data. The Viterbi algorithm implemented in the HMM v1.0 package (15) in R (9) was used to estimate the sequence K. After prediction of growth stages, stationary classifications were confronted against growth rates. If a given stationary stage presented a median growth rate greater than the maximum growth rate of the lagging phase, it was re-classified as a \"linear\" stage.",

Decline of growth rate was observed one day after, and deceleration started within 4 days. (c) Our analysis indicated that Qatar reached its peaking acceleration on March 9 th 2020 (red dot), the same day when Qatari officials had announced the closure of schools, nurseries, and universities, in addition to strong restrictions to traveling. One day after, the country registered a sudden spike in the number of cases (arrow). The days that followed were marked by a clear decline in acceleration and eventually deceleration of growth, which coincided with a succession of measures by the Qatari government that eventually led to significant restrictions to human movement. Although stationary growth was expected after deceleration, these three countries passed through a short linear phase and then regained acceleration, which initiated a new exponential phase. Estonia has further initiated a second deceleration stage on March 27 th 2020.",
