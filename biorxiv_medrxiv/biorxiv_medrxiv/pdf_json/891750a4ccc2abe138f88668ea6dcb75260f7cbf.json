Investigations reported by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) demonstrated that a new coronavirus, now known as SARS-Cov-2, was at the origin of this epidemic [3] . The retrospective analysis of the earlier transmission in Wuhan revealed that human-to-human transmission had occurred since the middle of December through close contacts [4] . After a very rapid dissemination in the Hubei province, the disease 10 has spread to all the other provinces in China. Currently, the epidemic seems to be getting under control thanks to strict control measures [5] . During its early spread in China, the virus also reached several countries in the world, in particular Japan where early measures enabled to control its spread relatively well [6] , although restarts cannot be excluded. More recently several important new clusters broke out in South Korea, Iran and Italy by the end of February. 15 Beginning of March most of Europe was affected, to be followed by the USA. Currently the epidemic is affecting the whole world [7] .",

The first replicable application was in ecology [18] . In epidemiology, it enabled to obtain an interpretable model for the epidemic of Bombay bubonic plague (1896-1911) by extracting the couplings between the human epidemic and the epizootics of two species of rats. Although obtained from 5 observational time series without strong a priori model structure, it was found possible in the latter case to give an interpretation to all the model's terms [19] . A model was also obtained for the West Africa epidemic of Ebola Virus Disease (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) coupling the two observed variables made available with a regular sampling: the cumulated number of infected cases and deaths [20] . In the present study, this modelling approach is used to model the current Covid-19 10 epidemic in Asia (China, Japan and South Korea) and then to produce scenarios for fourteen other countries where the disease was introduced later and spread locally.",

These values are not fully consistent with the model's 5 variables ranges at convergence. This is due to the increased actions taken to control the disease, which prevented the propagation of the disease before it could reach this level. This control action was effective in slowing down the spread of the epidemic itself, but not on the fatality numbers as no treatment was available to cure the infected people. The reduction of severe cases and deaths could therefore only be caused by measures to slow down the epidemic progression. 10 That can explain why the maximum values of daily deaths simulated by the model could not be reached by C 1 but was exceeded by s 1 and D 1 .",

In particular, it could be used to adapt more classical modelling approaches when needed to ensure mitigation or, hopefully, eradication of the disease [5, 24] (important 15 methodological differences between the present study and more classical modelling approaches are sketched in Suppl. Mat. 7). This work could be used also to inform decision makers in countries in other parts of the world, especially in the LMICs countries, such as in Africa [25] and southeast Asia, where numbers of Covid-19 cases are still relatively low and where rapid enforcement of control measures similar to those done in the Hubei province, in South Korea and 20 Japan should be done to prevent a catastrophic evolution of the disease.",

For most European countries, the scenarios are still quickly 5 evolving from Heilongjiang to Hubei types of scenario, highlighting that the outbreaks are not under control in Europe and that strong measures are still not able to slow down the disease. Italy has even largely exceeded the Hubei both in terms of number of cases and deaths. At present, possibly partly due to the delay expected between the measures and their effect (at least 12 days), there is no direct correlation between the time of implementation of the most stringent control 10 measures and the evolution of the disease situation in the different countries (in terms of number of cumulative cases and weekly cases, see",
