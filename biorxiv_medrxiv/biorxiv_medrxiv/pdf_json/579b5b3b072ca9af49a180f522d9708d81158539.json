Regardless, it is very crucial to estimate how much smaller the risk of death is among non-elderly people (<65 years old) as opposed to older individuals and how frequent deaths are in people who are <65 years old and have no underlying predisposing diseases. Media have capitalized on stories of young healthy individuals with severe, fatal outcomes. However, the majority of patients dying with SARS-CoV-2 are elderly and the large majority of the deceased may have severe underlying diseases. Exaggeration should be avoided in responding to the pandemic. 3 Accurate estimates of death risk have important implications for the projecting eventual total loss of quality-adjusted life-years, since deaths of young, healthy people contribute far more qualityadjusted life-years lost than deaths in elderly individuals with pre-existing morbidity. Knowledge of COVID-19 death risks for people <65 years old at the population level may affect the viability of different management strategies for the pandemic. People <65 years old represents the lion's share of the workforce.",

Most locations seem to be close to the peak or may have passed the peak of the epidemic wave as of April 4, but this is not certain.

Therefore, we converted the absolute risks of COVID-19 death into equivalents of death risk by a well-known, almost ubiquitous activity, 4 driving/travelling by motor vehicle. We used estimates from the International Transport Forum Road Safety Annual Report 2018 (ref. 5) for the number of road deaths per billion vehicle miles for each European country. For Spain, Italy, and Portugal there were only data available for number of road fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants. Since these tend to correlate reasonably well with road deaths per billion vehicle miles in Europe, we used for Italy and Portugal the same road deaths per billion kilometers as Belgium, since they have the same road deaths per 100,000 inhabitants and we did the same for Germany and Spain. For USA locations, we used the state-specific data provided for 2018 by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. 6 For New York City, we used motor vehicle fatality data pertaining to New York State. We then divided the estimated miles travelled that correspond to the same death risk by the number of days that have passed since the first COVID-19 death was recorded in each location and until April 4, 2020. The result transforms the average risk of COVID-19 death during the period where COVID-19 deaths occur into an equivalent of miles travelled by car per day.",

The absolute risk of death for people <65 years old ranged widely from 1.7 per million in Germany to 79 per million in New York City.

Based on existing data to-date, 7-9 cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and severe asthma, diabetes, kidney failure, severe liver disease, immunodeficiency, and malignancy may confer an increased risk of adverse outcome. Individuals with these diseases should consider that their risk may be higher than average and rigorous prognostic models need to be developed to estimate with accuracy the increased risk. In non-elderly populations, the more prevalent of these conditions is cardiovascular disease and hypertension, with prevalence of approximately 10% in the 20-39 age group and 38% in the 40-59 age group in the USA 24 and similarly high percentages in many other countries. Unfortunately, we could not identify data with the prevalence of these conditions specifically among the non-elderly deceased patients with COVID-19, and we encourage public health authorities to start reporting systematically data on comorbidities according to age strata. However, some data are available for the prevalence of these conditions across all age groups of COVID-19 deaths. For example, in the Netherlands, 49% of individuals dying with COVID-19 had cardiovascular disease or hypertension, and 27% had chronic pulmonary disease. Comparing with the prevalence of these diseases in the general population, 25 it is likely that ~2-fold increases in death risk may be reasonable to expect for people with these conditions in the general population.

If larger scale studies further document that the infection is very common and infection fatality rate is modest across the general population, the finding of very low risk in the vast majority of the general population has major implications for strategic next steps in managing the COVID-19",

Most of the hotbed locations that we analyzed are on the lower side of this range, where the risk of death is in the same level roughly as dying from a car accident during daily commute. The highest risk (in New York City) corresponds to the risk of dying in a traffic accident while travelling daily from Manhattan to Baltimore round trip for these 25 days. People who are 40-65 years old may have about double that risk, while those 40 years old or younger have almost no risk at all of dying.",
