Among the other six, 69 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can cause severe respiratory illness, whereas 229E, HKU1, 70 NL63, and OC43 produce mild symptoms [5] . Current evidence strongly suggests that all 71 human associated coronaviruses originated from other animals, such as bats and rodents [5, 72 6]. While SARS-CoV-2 shares similar genomic structure with other coronaviruses [7-10], its 73 sequence differs substantially from some of the betacoronaviruses that infect humans, such as 74 SARS-CoV (approximately 76% identity), MERS-CoV (43% identity), and HKU-1 (33% 75 identity), but exhibits 96% similarity to a coronavirus collected in Yunnan Province, China 76 from a bat, Rhinolophus affinis. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 most likely originated from bats [2, 77 dN in the RBD region is 0.023, approximately one third of the estimate for the rest of the 105 spike gene (0.068), dS in the RBD (0.710) is actually slightly higher than in the rest of the 106 spike sequence (0.651). This argues against the recombination scenario. We noticed that the 107 dS of the whole spike and the RBD, are 2-and 3-fold, respectively, higher than the genome 108 average. Since synonymous sites are typically less influenced by selection, the increased 109 divergence in dS may reflect an underlying elevated mutation rate. skewed. While the former shows excess of both high and low frequency mutations, the latter 116 mainly exhibits an excess of low frequency changes (Fig. 1a) . The excess of low frequency 117 mutations is consistent with the recent origin of SARS-CoV-2 [19]. Both population 118 reduction and positive selection can increase high frequency mutations [20, 21] . However, 119 the first scenario is contradicted by the recent origin of the virus. If positive selection has 120 been operating, we would expect an excess of high frequency non-synonymous as well as 121 synonymous changes. Furthermore, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes is 122 2.46 (138/56) among singleton variants, but only 1.42 (17/12) among non-singletons. Both of 123 these observations suggest that the majority of amino acid-altering mutations are selected 124 against, with no positive selection in evidence.",

The divergence at synonymous sites 129 between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is 17%, approximately 3-fold greater than between 130 humans and rhesus macaques [22] . With such high level of divergence, the possibility of 131 multiple substitutions cannot be ignored, especially since substitution in the coronavirus 132 genome is strongly biased toward transitions (see above).

Using the outgroup comparison, the C found in the rest of the human 140 SARS-CoV-2 sequences is a derived mutation. However, the T at this position is restricted to 141 genomes collected from Singapore on 2/4 and 2/6/2020 and not found in earlier samples. It is 142 thus more sensible to infer that this T is a back mutation derived from C rather than an 143 ancestral nucleotide. Another synonymous change at position 24034 occurred twice 144 (C24034T) on different genomic backgrounds (marked \u03ba in Fig 2) .

We only see an excess of singleton mutations, consistent with a recent reaching approximately 30% by 1/23/2020, suggesting that 84S may exhibit some advantage 168 over 84L. If genomes carrying 84S were ancestral, it would be a challenge to explain its 169 absence in early samplings. In addition, as mentioned above, C-T transitions are dominant in 170 coronavirus evolution and multiple hits were observed in SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2 ). It is 171 therefore possible that 28814C mutated to T after ancestral SARS-CoV-2 diverged from the 172 common ancestor with RaTG13 and recently changed back to C. Finally, if 84L is indeed a 173 derived haplotype and has rapidly increased in its frequency by positive selection, we would 174 expect haplotypes carrying 84L to have accumulated more derived mutations than haplotypes 175 with 84S. However, after correcting for mutational direction, the two haplotypes exhibited In addition to L84S, a G-T transversion at 26114 which caused an amino acid change 180 in orf3 protein (G251V) is also at intermediate frequency (Table 2) . 251V was first seen on 181 1/22/2020 and gradually increased its frequency to 13% by our sampling date (Fig. 3) .

The latter showed up on 1/22/2020 and 185 rapidly increased its frequency within two weeks.

While genotypic convergence may 244 be observed in viruses repeatedly evolving under particular conditions, such as drug 245 resistance and immune escape [26-29], it is otherwise rare. For adaptations that do not 246 involve highly specialized conditions, divergent molecular pathways may develop and 247 genotypic convergence would not be expected [30].

The amino acids in the RBD region of the two genomes259    have been maintained by natural selection ever since, while synonymous substitutions have 260 been accumulated. If this is true, SARS-CoV-2 may have circulated cryptically among 261 humans for years before being recently noticed.262The ancient origin of SARS-CoV-2 is supported by its lack of a signature of adaptive263 evolution as shown by frequency spectra and dN/dS in samples from the recent epidemic. For 264 a recently acquired virus, rapid evolution and a strong signature of positive selection are 265 expected. For example, during its short epidemic in 2002-2003, several rounds of adaptive 266 changes have been documented in SARS-CoV genomes [23, 24]. After adapting to its host, 267 the virus may evolve under purifying or relaxed selection, exactly as we see in SARS-CoV-2. 268 Therefore, it is important to sequence samples from the early outbreak and to examine 269 hospital archives for the trace of SARS-CoV-2 ancestors. This information not only can help 270 us to understand the evolutionary path of this virus but also unravel the critical steps for it to 271 achieve effective spreading in humans. 272 In addition to the RBD, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein also contains a small insertion 273 of a polybasic cleavage site which was thought to be unique within the B lineage of evidence that such seemingly sorcerous site insertions can occur in nature 277 [11]. Both the polybasic cleavage site in RmYN02 and RBD in pangolin_2019 suggest that, 278 like with SARS-CoV [6], all genetic elements required to form SARS-CoV-2 may have 279 existed in the environment. More importantly, they can be brought together by frequent 280 intergenomic recombination (see Result). Nature never runs out of material to create new 281 pathogens. It is not whether but when and where the next epidemic will occur. 282 There is a heated debate about the evolutionary forces influencing the trajectory of the 283 L84S mutation in orf8 protein (http://virological.org/t/response-to-on-the-origin-and-284 continuing-evolution-of-sars-cov-2/418). While Tang et al. considered Serine is the ancestral 285 amino acid [13], we present evidence that it is a back mutation. The majority of sequences in 286Wuhan were sampled before early January 2020 and most genomes carrying 84S were found 287 outside Wuhan after middle to late January 2020. The discrepancy in time and space impedes 288 the effort to resolve the debate. It would require more sequences from the early stage of the 289 epidemic to settle this issue. Regardless of its ancestral or derived status, we hypothesize that 290 84S may confer some selective advantage. Unless the sampling scheme is deliberately 291 skewed, it is difficult to explain such dramatic frequency gain of 84S, from 0 to ~30% in two 292 weeks. Oddly, its frequency ceased to increase after 1/23/2020, when Wuhan was locked293 down. This coincidence prompts us to consider the effect of social distancing on virus 294 transmission. Another line of evidence comes from the frequency increase of 215V in orf3 295 protein. The 215V first appeared on 1/22/2020 and rapidly increased its frequency within two 296 weeks.297Several studies suggested that the orf8 protein may function in viral replication, 298 modulating endoplasmic reticulum stress, inducing apoptosis, and inhibiting interferon",
