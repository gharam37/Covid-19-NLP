Further, existing protocols are designed for testing the fit and performance N95 respirators and tight-fitting facemasks rather than the relatively more loose-fitting surgical mask style most cloth masks follow. In this study tools and methods typically used to assess tight-fitting facemasks were modified to assess the efficacy of community-produced fabric and commercially-produced surgical masks in terms of protecting the wearer from airborne particles that may be carrying virus. Two TSI PortaCount (model 8028) instruments were operated concurrently to collect particle counts (particles/cm 3 ) in size range 0.02 to >1 \u00b5m from ambient air and air just inside the breathing zone of the mask (1 measurement per second, evaluation period of 1 minute per test). Percent particle removal was determined for ten home-made, fabric masks of different designs, with and without filter layers, as well as three commercially-produced surgical-type masks. N95 masks were used to validate the method, and a 3M model 1826 surgical mask was used as a baseline for comparison of other masks of this style. Homemade masks worn as designed always had lower particle removal rates than the 3M masks, achieving between 38% and 96% of this baseline. As has been previously observed by Cooper et al. (1983), adding a layer of nylon stocking over the masks minimized the flow of air around the edges of the masks and improved particle filtration efficiency for all masks, including all commercial products tested. Use of a nylon stocking overlayer brought the particle filtration efficiency for five of the ten fabric masks above the 3M surgical mask baseline. This rapid testing method (<2 hours per mask design) provides a holistic evaluation of mask particle removal efficacy (material, design, and fit), and use of this method for testing a wider range of mask materials and designs will provide the public and health care providers with information needed to optimize health protection given resources at hand.

Anticipating the need to produce face coverings from readily-available materials, several studies used standard methods for materials testing to compare the filtration efficiency of materials such as cotton t-shirts, sweatshirts, handkerchiefs, and towels with the filtration efficiency of facepiece respirators (N95 masks) and surgical masks (Cooper et al. 1983a; OSHA 1998; van der Sande et al. 2008; Rengasamy et al. 2010; ASTM 2017b; a; 2019a; b) . While none of these materials produced filtration efficiency close to respirators such as N95s, cotton cloth facemasks were found to provide about half the protection of standard surgical masks against airborne particles (van der Sande et al. 2008) , while an elastic layer (e.g., nylon stocking) placed over the mask material was found to improve filtration efficiency of loose-fitting masks by minimizing air flow around the cloth layers (Cooper et al. 1983b ).",

Several instruments have been specifically designed to perform fit tests of respirators and tight-sealing facemasks (e.g., TSI PortaCount). These tools and methods have been modified in the past to collect particle filtration data for loose-fitting, surgical type masks (van der Sande et al. 2008) , revealing that head motions and positions do not significantly affect the performance of loose-fitting masks in terms of filtering out nano-sized particles. This suggests that a simplified mask testing protocol for loose-fitting masks can provide a representative measure of particle filtration efficacy, something critically needed given the highly varied results and protocol shortcomings noted in prior studies (Brosseau and Sietsema, 2020) .",

By collecting data on the counts of particles (0.02 to >1 \u00b5m) from both sides of the mask while it is being worn, both the material and the fit of the masks are tested simultaneously, and a simplified protocol enables testing of a novel mask design within <2 hours. These tests provide a rapid screening tool to test a variety of mask designs produced from readily-available materials. By conducting separate tests for masks worn loosely (as designed) and for the masks held close to the face using a layer of nylon stocking (as recommended by (Cooper et al. 1983b) ), this work also allows for separate evaluation of the combined effect of mask fit and materials on overall filtration efficiency versus the efficiency of the materials alone.",

Several of the fabric masks included filter layers such as cotton batting, Halyard H600 (sterilization wrap), and sections of HEPA vacuum bags.

Two PortaCount Plus instruments were used to report particle counts in air sampled from inside the mask (Mask PortaCount) and ambient air just outside the mask (Reference PortaCount) ( Figure  1 ). Because these instruments were not recently calibrated, nor last calibrated at the same time, an intercalibration was conducted to allow calibration adjustments on collected data. Each sampling day, calibration data (a minimum of three one-minute time series, n=180) were collected by recording readings simultaneously on both instruments while sample tubes were side-by-side (within 3 cm), open to the air (no mask), and a minimum of 1m from any person and 2m from the particle generator (as recommended by the manufacturer). The Mask PortaCount consistently reported higher particle counts; however, correlation coefficient between the readings from the two instruments was consistently above 0.9. Therefore day-specific linear regressions were used to normalize particle counts from the Reference PortaCount to equivalent particle counts from the Mask PortaCount. Data collection and processing. Each mask test consisted of three one-minute runs while wearing the mask as designed (Figure 2(a) ). To simulate a face-hugging fit like that used for N95 masks, each mask was also tested for one minute while pressing the material to the face around the breathing zone (across the bridge of nose, cheeks, and around the chin) using two hands. In addition, a more practical method of holding the mask material against the face was tested by adding section of nylon stocking over the entire mask area following recommendations from Copper et al. (1983a) (Figure 2(b) ). The N95 was not tested using either of these additional methods as this is already a tight-fitting mask. Tests were run on at least three replicate sample masks whenever possible, however for many masks only one sample was available.",
