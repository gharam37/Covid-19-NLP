Three were considered as imported cases as the patients stayed in Wuhan patients presented with cough. Fever was presented in 58\u00b70% of the patients on admission, 1 8 5 but gradually developed in 64\u00b70% patients during hospitalisation. Other less common 1 8 6 symptoms include muscle-ache(25\u00b70%), sore throat(24\u00b70%), shortness of breath(24\u00b70%), and 1 8 7 diarrhoea(14\u00b73%)(table 2). Two(4\u00b70%) patients were asymptomatic throughout the study 1 8 8 period. Regarding radiological examination, 27(54\u00b70%) showed bilateral pneumonia, 1 8 9 11(22\u00b70%) unilateral pneumonia, and 17(34\u00b77%) multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity. None of the patients was co-infected with other respiratory viruses or fungi. Two patients 1 9 1 were culture-positive for Klebsiella aerogenes and Ralstonia pickettii in their sputum 1 9 2 specimens. Both presented with ARDS and acute respiratory injury accompanied with septic 1 9 3 shock or acute renal injury, and required ICU admission. Of the 50 cases, 42(84\u00b70%) could be clustered based on their epidemiological linkages(figure 1 9 5 1). Six transmission clusters(Clusters 1-6) were identified. Cluster 1 involved a family of 1 9 6 four members.
