The main protease of SARS-CoV-2, 3C-like protease (3CL pro ), is highly conserved across coronaviruses and is essential for the maturation process of viral polyprotein. Scutellariae radix (Huangqin in Chinese), the root of Scutellaria baicalensis has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat viral infection related symptoms. The extracts of S. baicalensis have exhibited broad spectrum antiviral activities. We studied the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of S. baicalensis and its ingredient compounds. We found that the ethanol extract of S. baicalensis inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro activity in vitro and the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells with an EC50 of 0.74 \uf06dg/ml. Among the major components of S. baicalensis, baicalein strongly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro activity with an IC50 of 0.39 \uf06dM. We further identified four baicalein analogue compounds from other herbs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro activity at microM concentration. Our study demonstrates that the extract of S. baicalensis has effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and baicalein and analogue compounds are strong SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro inhibitors. author/funder.

The genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to that of SARS-CoV with 79.6% sequence identity [5] and remain stable up to now [6] . However, the sequence identities vary significantly for different viral proteins [7] . For instance, the spike proteins (S-protein) in CoVs are diverse in sequences and even in the host receptors that bind due to the rapid mutations and recombination [8] . Although it has been confirmed that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 as receptor and occupy the same binding site, their binding affinities to ACE2 vary due to subtle interface sequence variations [9] . On the contrary, the 3Clike proteases (3CL pro ) in CoVs are highly conserved. The 3CL pro in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share a sequence identity of 96.1 %, making it an ideal target for broad author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
