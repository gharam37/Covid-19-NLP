            "text": "The 2019 novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is an emerging pathogen of critical significance to international public health. Knowledge of the interplay between molecular-scale virus-receptor interactions, single-cell viral replication, intracellular-scale viral transport, and emergent tissue-scale viral propagation is limited. Moreover, little is known about immune system-virus-tissue interactions and how these can result in low-level (asymptomatic) infections in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in others, particularly with respect to presentation in different age groups or pre-existing inflammatory risk factors like diabetes. A critical question for treatment and protection is why it appears that the severity of infection may correlate with the initial level of virus exposure. Given the nonlinear interactions within and among each of these processes, multiscale simulation models can shed light on the emergent dynamics that lead to divergent outcomes, identify actionable \"choke points\" for pharmacologic interactions, screen potential therapies, and identify potential biomarkers that differentiate response dynamics. Given the complexity of the problem and the acute need for an actionable model to guide therapy discovery and optimization, we introduce a prototype of a multiscale model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in lung and intestinal tissue that will be iteratively refined. The first prototype model was built and shared internationally as open source code and interactive, cloud-hosted executables in under 12 hours. In a sustained community effort, this model will integrate data and expertise across virology, immunology, mathematical biology, quantitative systems physiology, cloud and high performance computing, and other domains to accelerate our response to this critical threat to international health.",

However, the dynamics of virus replication, interaction with host immune responses, and spread within the respiratory tract are still being established. Because a vaccine may not be available for 9-18 months, there is a critical need to further understand the infection in order to quickly identify pharmacologic interventions and optimal therapeutic designs that work to lessen virus dissemination and disease severity. However, this requires an international community effort that integrates expertise across a variety of domains and a platform that can be iteratively updated as new information and data arises.",

Secreted interferons can also modulate the function of innate and adaptive cellular immunity 15 . 6 Inflammatory and immune responses Lethal SARS and MERS in humans has been correlated with elevated IFN-\u237a,\u03b2 20 , myeloid activity, and impaired T and B cells 21, 22 , although the timing of Type 1 IFN is critical 23, 24 . Type I IFNs secreted by infected cells or by immune cells diffuse to surrounding cells and recruit innate immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, to the area. In COVID-19 patients, decreased numbers of T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and, to a lesser extent, B cells occur, and the extent of T cell depletion has been correlated with disease severity 2,3,25 . Excessive IFN-\u237a,\u03b2 activation results in increased macrophage and neutrophil presence, which correlates with lung dysfunction 26, 27 . Delayed IFN-\u237a,\u03b2 production also promotes inflammatory macrophage recruitment that contributes to vascular leakage and impaired T-cell function 23, 24 . Activated macrophages also produce other proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u237a, among others, that enhance infiltration of immune cells and interact with endothelial cells to cause vasodilation 28 .

In particular, chemokines are released following viral infection, which leads to the invasion of neutrophils and macrophages and release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, replication in the lower airways and exposure of endothelial cells may further amplify the inflammatory response 32 . Collectively, this leads to extensive tissue damage and depletion of epithelial cells, which may be connected to lethality 41 . Within the alveolar tissue, and systemically, the feedback between viral load, adaptive and innate immune response and tissue damage is clearly a complex system.

Primary cells and/or cell lines will be infected with SARS-CoV-2 at increasing multiplicities of infection and infectious viral titers in the supernatants assessed by plaque assays at multiple time points post initial infection.

Within this 119, there are multiple interventions at different points of the pathophysiology, including, but not limited to: hyperimmune plasma, IL-6 Antibody (e.g. Tocilizumab), protease inhibitors (e.g. Lopinavir/ritonavir), cloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, and Janus Kinases inhibitors (e.g. Baricitinib).

These internal models are often implemented as systems of ODEs. For example, cell uptake of diffusing substrates can be coupled with a metabolism model (system ODEs), and the resulting energy output can be used to set the cell's cycle progression and necrotic death probability 93 . For small systems of ODEs, these models are coded \"by hand\" with standard finite difference techniques. More complex models are written in systems biology markup language (SBML) 94 These approaches will be used to assess (1) The CIABM is intended to be a generalizable model of CD8 dynamics, designed to represent different disease states resulting from different perturbations (i.e. specific infections of specific pathogens, putative vaccines and their administration strategy). This is consistent with our group's philosophy of pathophysiological unification through modeling. We have developed multiple ABMs related to the immune response and diseases related to inflammation and immune dysfunction 98, 99 , and will leverage this experience to integrate various aspects of these models as components of the CIABM. Many of these models are based on the IIRABM 98 , which is an abstract representation and simulation of the human inflammatory signaling network response to injury; the model has been calibrated such that it reproduces the general clinical trajectories seen in sepsis. The IIRABM operates by simulating multiple cell types and their interactions, including endothelial cells, macrophages, neutrophils, TH0, TH1, and TH2 cells as well as their associated precursor cells. The simulated system dies when total damage (defined as aggregate endothelial cell damage) exceeds 80%; this threshold represents the ability of current medical technologies to keep patients alive (i.e., through organ support machines) in conditions that previously would have been lethal. The IIRABM will be used in the CIABM to represent the innate and host tissue component of the CIABM.",

However, if we don't take deliberate efforts to formally facilitate this intersection across our research communities, we risk producing a series of disparate individual efforts, limited in interoperability, transparency, reproducibility and scalability. The EMEWS (extreme model exploration with Swift) framework 100 was developed to directly address this issue and to provide a broadly applicable cyberinfrastructure to lower the barriers for utilization of advanced, large-scale model exploration on HPC resources. The EMEWS paradigm allows for the direct exploitation of cutting edge statistical and machine learning algorithms that make up the vibrant ecosystem of free and open source libraries that are continually added to and updated as research frontiers are expanded, all while controlling simulation workflows that can be run anywhere from desktops to campus clusters and to the largest HPC resources.",

More importantly, it showed that for viruses that rapidly create and exocytose new virions, release of additional assembled virions at the time of cell death does not significantly speed the spread of infection. Moreover, decreasing the cell tolerance to viral load does not drastically change the rate at which the infection spreads, but it does accelerate the rate of tissue damage and loss, which could potentially trigger edema and ARDS earlier. This 22 suggests that working to slow apoptosis may help preserve tissue integrity and delay adverse severe respiratory responses.
