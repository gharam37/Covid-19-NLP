According to World Bank data (WB, 2020) , Bangaldesh in 2015 has 0.8 hospital beds for every 1,000 people; by way of comparison, the India has 0.7 (2011), the Pakistan has 0.6 (2012), the SriLanka has 3.6 (2012), US has 2.9 (2012) while China has 4.2 (2012) beds per 1,000 people. Currently, hospitals in Bangladesh have total 1,169 ICU beds of which 432 are in government hospital and the remaining 737 in the private hospitals against a population of 170 milion (\"The Daily DhakaTribune\", March 21, 2020). Total number of ICU beds in a hospital should be between 5% and 12% depending on the care given by the hospital [ (Kennedy & Pronovost, 2006) , (Nafseen, 2018) ]. In 2017-18, the total number of beds in hospitals were 1,27,360, among them 48,934 were in governmental hospitals and 78,426 were in private hospitals [(Nafseen, 2018) , (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 2017) ].

Paul et al.

Paul et al. (2020) used Bangladesh data up to 2nd April, 2020 by which, Bangladesh has only 95 infection cases and 9 deaths. However, their prediction model for Bangladesh may not give reasonable results because of sufficiently small sample. Mamun and Grith (2020) discussed possible suicide prevention strategies while the first COVID-19 suicide case in Bangladesh took place due to fear of COVID-19 and xenophobia. Neither of the three research works dealt with the analysis of current COVID-19 situations in Bangladesh and to make direct projections for incidence, deaths, hospital ICU beds, number of severe patients etc that are the main goals of this paper. These statistics may help government to take proper preparation to tackle the potential unprecidented situations in Bangladesh.",

We call this procedure as the ITPS (Infection Trajectory-Pathway Strategy). Bangladesh crossed 100 case mark on April 7 exactly one month after the first case that was identified on April 8. However, Figure 5 shows that Bangladesh could follow the same pathway of infection trajectory (between 3 and 5 days to double the cases) that is experienced by any of the five countries-Austria who is 29 days ahead, Isreal who is 25 days ahead, Netherlands who is 31 days ahead, France who is 38 days ahead and United Kingdom who is 32 days ahead. These lead to the projected infections for Bangladesh as reported in Table 1 . This table also shows the projected deaths estimated based on the global CFR value which is about 6 (Johns Hopkins University, 2020b) as on April 14, 2020. This projection method suggests that Bangladesh could cross 14,000 case mark and 850 deaths, in worst scenario, by May 13 while infection and death toll could cross 100,000 and 8500 respectively around in May 20.",

For giving tratment to critical patients fully functional ICU beds are crucial. The ICU beds are not useful in the absence of an adequate number of trained critical health-care workers, medical supplies like personal protective equipment (PPE) that are needed for crisis management. Therefor, the government, hospital administrators, and policy makers must work with ICU doctors and nurses to prepare for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity. Goverment must protect in unprecedented ways the health-care workers from nosocomial transmission and physical exhaustion including several mental health issues. We believe this study will help the Government and health-care workers in preparing their plans for the next two or three weeks. Our predictions by both methods are suitable for both short-term and medium-term interval, and these models can be tuned for forecasting in long-term intervals.",

As reported inTable 1, according to ITPS Bangladesh will have similar number of infections like 14,200 by Austria who is 29 days ahead, 12,000 by Isreal who is 25 days ahead, 27,400 by Netherlands who is 31 days ahead, 143,300 by France who is 38 days ahead and 93,900 by United Kingdom who is 32 days ahead. This paper also presented the projection results by the polynomial regression model which is suitable for short period of time.
