According to WHO reports, COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome which is transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact routes. Analysis of this disease requires major attention by the Government to take necessary steps in reducing the effect of this global pandemic. In this study, outbreak of this disease has been analysed for India till 30 th March 2020 and predictions have been made for the number of cases for the next 2 weeks. SEIR model and Regression model have been used for predictions based on the data collected from John Hopkins University repository in the time period of 30 th January 2020 to 30 th March 2020. The performance of the models was evaluated using RMSLE and achieved 1.52 for SEIR model and 1.75 for the regression model. The RMSLE error rate between SEIR model and Regression model was found to be 2.01. Also, the value of R 0 which is the spread of the disease was calculated to be 2.02. Expected cases may rise between 5000-6000 in the next two weeks of time. This study will help the Government and doctors in preparing their plans for the next two weeks. Based on the predictions for short-term interval, these models can be tuned for forecasting in long-term intervals.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is a major global health threat. The Novel COVID-19 has been reported as the most detrimental respiratory virus since 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 situation report [1] as on March 27, 2020, a total of 509,164 confirmed cases and 23,335 deaths have been reported across the world. Global spread has been rapid, with 170 countries now having reported at least one case. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Corona virus belongs to a family of viruses which is responsible for illness ranging from common cold to deadly diseases as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which were first discovered in China [2002] and Saudi Arabia [2012] . The 2019-novel Coronavirus or better known as COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China for the very first time on 31st December 2019. According to Jiang et al. [3] the fatality rate for this virus has been estimated to be 4.5% but for the age group 70-79 this has gone up to 8.0% while for those >80 it has been noted to be 14.8%. This has led to elderly persons above the age of 50 with underlying diseases like diabetes, Parkinson's disease and cardiovascular disease to be considered at the highest risk. Symptoms for this disease can take 2-14 days to appear and can range from fever, cough, shortness of breath to pneumonia, kidney failure and even death [1] . The transmission is person to person via respiratory droplets among close contact with the average number of people infected by a patient being 1.5 -3.5 but the virus is not considered airborne [2] . There exist a large number of evidences where machine learning algorithms have proven to give efficient predictions in healthcare [4] [5] [6] . Nsoesie et al. [7] has provided a systematic review of approaches used to forecast the dynamics of influenza pandemic. They have reviewed research papers based on deterministic mass action models, regression models, prediction rules, Bayesian network, SEIR model, ARIMA forecasting model etc. Recent studies on COVID-19 include only exploratory analysis of the available limited data [8] [9] [10] . Effective and well-tested vaccine against CoVID-19 has not been invented and hence a key part in managing this pandemic is to decrease the epidemic peak, also known as flattening the epidemic curve. The role of data scientists and data mining researchers is to integrate the related data and technology to better understand the virus and its characteristics, which can help in taking right decisions and concrete plan of actions. It will lead to a bigger picture in taking aggressive measures in developing infrastructure, facilities, vaccines and restraining similar epidemics in future. The objectives of the current study are as follows.",

These models can be used to evaluate disease from within the host model i.e. influence interaction within the cells of the host to metapopulation model i.e. how its spread in geographically separated populations. The most important part of this model is to calculate the R0 value. The value of R0 tells about the contagiousness of disease. It is the fundamental goal of epidemiologists studying a new case. In simple terms R0 determines an average of what number of people can be affected by a single infected person over a course of time. If the value of R0 < 1, this signifies the spread is expected to stop. If the value of R0 = 1, this signifies the spread is stable or endemic. If the value of R0 >, 1 this signifies the spread in increasing in the absence of intervention as shown in Figure 1 . Equation (1) calculates the percentage of the population needed to be vaccinated to stabilize the spread of disease.",

Linear regression is a simple model which is used to finds the relation between a dependent and an independent variable. It uses the value of intercept and slope to predict the output variable. Equation 7 shows the relationship between a dependent and independent variable in a linear regression model. In Equation 7 , and are two independent variables which represent intercept and slope respectively and is the error rate. This creates a straight line and is mostly used for predictive analysis.

Also, with linear trends, the patients getting recovered can be managed easily and death rate can be controlled as well. The findings of the current study may explode exponentially as shown by Gupta and Pal [13] if stringent control measures are not taken by the Government. Hospital provisions and medical facility enhancement work should be continued at a very rapid pace to prepare the country for exponential growth, if it occurs. However, with current interventions and preparations, the Government of India is looking forward to flatten the curve. During the prediction of the confirmed cases as shown in Table 1 , there were few challenges associated with the data. The data was not stationary and showed an exponential growth after 40 days from 22 nd Jan 2020 as shown in Figure 4 . Overfitting remains a major problem with disease spread time series data. In this model, we have addressed the overfitting problem using decay based intervention. Another problem faced in this study was shortage of training data. Data for 25 days was used for training purpose and 5 days data for validation, based on which the number of confirmed cases for next 14 days was predicted. The training data is very less for any machine learning to train itself . Also, rapid changes in number of infected cases occurred in mid-March. The SEIR model shows an advantage as it does not grow exponentially with time but also uses some intervention methods with time. For intervention, a hill decay model was used. In the case of a regression model, different features can be used for decaying or intervention eg. the number of cases recovered etc., but growth of the regression line still remains a problem. For a regression model, we always need to train the model after some time with the change in trend in the data. The SEIR model also uses some assumptions like the number of people in susceptible class, for which we have taken 70% of the population to susceptible class. In this study, we have only predicted the number of confirmed cases. To predict the number of death cases we faced many problems of data stationarity. Also, with limited data, the model was not able to predict the number of death cases properly. We have used only time series data for confirmed cases and death cases in this study. Using other data related to weather, geographic layout of the country, state-level population and governance parameters, the model prediction rate can be further improved.",

We have analysed the data and found out that the number of cases per million in India is less than 0.5 till 30 th March 2020. Then, with the help of the SEIR model the value of R0 was computed to be 2.02. Also, we predicted the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 for the next 14 days starting from 31 st March 2020 -13 th April 2020. During performance evaluation, our model computed the value of RMSLE for the SEIR model to be 1.52 and 1.75 for the regression model. Also, the value of spread of disease of R 0 was found to be 2.02. The result obtained from this study is taken from training data up to 30 th March 2020. Further, looking at the trend, there is definitely going to be an increase in the number of cases. Doctors, health workers and people involved in providing essential services have to be protected in accordance with prescribed medical norms. Community spreading in the future due to carelessness of individuals as well as groups can exponentially increase the number of cases. The peak is yet to come, hence the Government has to be extra vigil and enforce strict measures. In addition, provision of medical facilities across the country has to be aggressively enhanced. In future, an automated algorithm can be developed to fetch data in regular intervals and automatically predict the number of cases for weekly and biweekly data. In this way, Government and hospital facilities can also maintain a check on the supply and medical assistance / isolation required for new patients.",
