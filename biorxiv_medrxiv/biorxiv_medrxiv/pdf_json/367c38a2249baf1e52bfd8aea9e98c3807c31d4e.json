The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was termed \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS-CoV-2) on 11 February 2020 by the WHO. COVID-19 is now a global threat, so its outbreak was declared to be a pandemic on 11 March 2020 by the WHO. There are significant knowledge gaps in the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, investigation tools, and management of COVID-19 [3] . A specific drug or vaccine has not been approved to treat it.

Since then, an increasing number of clinical trials of COVID-19 have been registered using regimens based on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine (WM). Previously, we found several problems regarding the protocols of clinical trials of COVID-19 (e.g., unclear study objectives, heterogeneity of outcome choices, and small study population [5] ) that may reduce the value of clinical trials. In the meantime, clinicians' understanding of COVID-19 characteristics has been changing because they are treating many more patients than before. The diagnosis and management plan of COVID-2019 also keeps changing. We believe that certain inappropriate outcomes may be chosen by researchers. To improve the consistency of outcomes and include more clinical trials in systematic reviews, development of a \"core outcome set\" (COS) for COVID-19 is crucial.",
