Around February 101 20 th , when South Korea, Italy and Iran showed signs of potential COVID-19 outbreaks, Zhejiang and 102 Guangdong already have had the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases in China (outside of Hubei 103 province). Italy, South Korea and Iran were affected relatively early in the pandemic and developed a 104 large number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Also, as is discussed in [12-15], there exist certain 105 similarities in the social, economic or environmental conditions between the pairs \"Zhejiang-South 106 Korea,\" \"Guangdong-Italy,\" and \"Xinjiang-Iran\". Zhejiang and Guangdong are among the most 107 internationalized regions in China. Zhejiang and South Korea have almost the same land area and 108 population, and their climate and GDP are relatively close. Among all provinces and autonomous 109 regions in China, Guangdong is the one that could probably best match Italy, by the overall 110 consideration of social, economic and environmental conditions. Xinjiang and Iran have social and 111 culture similarities. Detailed descriptions of the six study regions can be found in the Supporting 112 Materials section (Text S1).

The initial increasing 269 trends are similar for all regions considered, but then significant differences occurred. The Xinjiang 270 curve was the first to show a downward decline (implying a rather early epidemic control), followed 271 by the Zhejiang and Guangdong curves at later times (these two curves are remarkably similar).
