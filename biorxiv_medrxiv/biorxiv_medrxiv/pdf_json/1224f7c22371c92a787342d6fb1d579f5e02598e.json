In 37 the present study we investigated which host cell proteases activate the SARS-CoV-2 S 38 protein in Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells. We show that S can be cleaved by both the 39 proprotein convertase furin at the S1/S2 site and the transmembrane serine protease 2 40 (TMPRSS2) at the S2' site. We demonstrate that TMPRSS2 is essential for activation of 41 SARS-CoV-2 S in Calu-3 cells through antisense-mediated knockdown of TMPRSS2 42 expression. Further, we show that SARS-CoV-2 replication can be efficiently inhibited by two 43 synthetic inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and also by the broad range serine protease inhibitor 44 aprotinin. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 replication was also strongly inhibited by the synthetic 45 furin inhibitor MI-1851. Combining various TMPRSS2 inhibitors with MI-1851 produced more 46 potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 than an equimolar amount of any single serine 47 protease inhibitor. In contrast, inhibition of endosomal cathepsins by E64d did not affect virus 48",

To test, whether the S1/S2 149 sequence of SARS-CoV-2 S protein is efficiently cleaved by furin, a small series of 150 Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) substrates was synthesized ( Fig. 2A ). All 151 compounds possess a 3-nitrotyrosine amide as P4\u02c8 residue and a 2-amino-benzoyl 152 fluorophore in P7 position. The analogous sequences of the S proteins from MERS-CoV, 153 SARS-CoV, and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain Beaudette were prepared as 154 reference substrates. Moreover, two FRET substrates of the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 cleavage 155 site with P2 A\uf0aeK and A\uf0aeR mutations were synthesized, to evaluate whether they could 156 constitute even more efficient cleavage sites for furin than the wild-type. The FRET 2_M1, which contains an optimized furin recognition site by virtue of an A\uf0aeK mutation in P2 164 position, was cleaved with similar efficiency compared to the wild-type sequence. However, 165 substitution of A\uf0aeR in the P2 position strongly enhanced cleavage by furin. As expected, the 166 analogous reference sequence of IBV was also processed by furin very efficiently.

CoV S cleavage is believed to occur sequentially, with cleavage at the S1/S2 site occurring first and subsequent cleavage at the S2\u2032 site. Furin processes the S1/S2 site, whereas TMPRSS2 cleaves at the S2' site, and both proteases cannot compensate each other. Inhibition of either furin (ii) or TMPRSS2 (iii) or simultaneous inhibition of both proteases (iv) renders the S protein fusion-inactive and prevents virus entry. Inhibition of TMPRSS2 prevents exposure of the fusion peptide at the N-terminus of the S2' subunit (iii and iv). Inhibition of furin cleavage at the S1/S2 site may directly interfere with virus entry and membrane fusion by steric blockage of conformational changes (ii, upper scheme) or may prevent exposure of the S2' site to TMPRSS2 (ii, lower scheme). Fusion-competent S is indicated in blue, fusionincompetent S in grey.",

            "text": "91 Subsequently, TMPRSS2 was shown to activate the fusion proteins of a number of other 92 respiratory viruses including human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenza viruses as well 93 as CoVs including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in vitro 94 (reviewed in B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user, 2018; Hoffmann et al., 2018). TMPRSS2 cleaves at 95 single arginine or lysine residues (R/K\u2193), and hence, activates viral fusion proteins at so 96 called monobasic cleavage sites. More recent studies by us and others demonstrated that 97 TMPRSS2-deficient mice do not suffer from pathology when infected with certain influenza A 98 virus strains, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, due to inhibition of proteolytic 99 actviation of progeny virus and consequently inhibition of virus spread along the respiratory 100 tract (Hatesuer et al., 2013; Tarnow et al., 2014; Sakai et al., 2014; Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 101 2019). These studies identified TMPRSS2 as an essential host cell factor for these 102 respiratory viruses and further demonstrated that inhibition of virus activating host cell 103 proteases, particularly TMPRSS2, provides a promising approach for the development of 104 therapeutics to treat respiratory virus infections. The proprotein convertase (PC) furin is a 105 type I transmembrane protein that is ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic tissues and cells. 106 Furin cleaves the precursors of a broad range of proteins including hormones, growth 107 factors, cell surface receptors and adhesion molecules during their transport along the 108 secretory pathway at multibasic motifs of the preferred consensus sequence R-X-R/K-R\u2193 109 (reviewed in Garten, 2018). Moreover, furin has been identified as an activating protease for 110 the fusion proteins of a broad range of viruses including highly pathogenic avian influenza A 111 viruses (HPAIV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola virus, Measles virus, and 112 Yellow Fever virus as well as bacterial toxins such as Shiga toxin or anthrax toxin at 113 multibasic motifs (reviewed in Klenk and Garten, 1994; Rockwell et al., 2002; Garten, 2018). 114 Acquisition of a multibasic cleavage site by insertion of basic amino acids has long been 115 known to be a prime determinant of avian influenza A virus pathogenicity in poultry. 116 Activation of the surface glycoprotein HA of HPAIV by furin supports systemic spread of 117 infection with often lethal outcome. In contrast, the HA of low pathogenic avian influenza A 118 viruses (LPAIV) is activated at a monobasic cleavage site by trypsin-like serine proteases. 119Appropriate proteases are believed to be expressed in the respiratory and intestinal tract of 120 birds, confining spread of infection to these tissues.",

To specifically 203 knockdown TMPRSS2 activity, we previously developed an antisense peptide-conjugated 204 phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PPMO) (B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al., 2011). 205 PPMO are single-stranded nucleic acid-like compounds, composed of a morpholino oligomer 206 covalently conjugated to a cell-penetrating peptide, and can interfere with gene expression 207 by sterically blocking complementary RNAs. PPMO are water-soluble and achieve entry into 208 cells and tissues without assisted delivery (reviewed in Stein, 2008; Moulton and Moulton, 209 2010). The previously developed PPMO T-ex5 interferes with correct splicing of TMPRSS2 210 pre-mRNA, resulting in the production of mature mRNA lacking exon 5 and consequently 211 expression of a truncated TMPRSS2 form that is enzymatically inactive. Using T-ex5 PPMO-212 mediated knockdown of TMPRSS2 activity, we were able to identify TMPRSS2 as the major 213 influenza A virus activating protease in Calu-3 cells and primary human airway epithelial cells 214 and of influenza B virus in primary human type II pneumocytes (B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et 215 al., 2011; Limburg et al., 2019). 216 Here, Calu-3 cells were treated once with T-ex5 PPMO for 24 h prior to infection with SARS-217 CoV-2 in order to inhibit the production of normal TMPRSS2-mRNA and deplete 218 enzymatically active TMPRSS2 present in the cells. The cells were then inoculated with 219 SARS-CoV-2 at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001, further incubated without 220 additional PPMO treatment for 72 h, then fixed and immunostained using an antiserum 221 against the 2002 SARS-CoV. As shown in Fig. 3A, a strong cytopathic effect (CPE) and 222 efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection was visible in Calu-3 cells treated with a negative-223 control PPMO of nonsense sequence designated as \"scramble\" as well as untreated cells 224 that were used as controls. In contrast, no CPE and only small foci of infection were 225 observed in T-ex5 PPMO treated cells at 72 h p.i. (Fig. 3A). To examine SARS-CoV-2 226 activation and multicycle replication in PPMO treated cells in more detail, Calu-3 cells were 227 treated with PPMO for 24 h prior to infection, then inoculated with virus at a MOI of 0.001 for 228 1.5 h and incubated for 72 h in the absence of further PPMO, as described above. At 229 different time points virus titers in supernatants were determined by tissue culture infection 230 dose 50 % (TCID 50 ) end-point dilution. T-ex5 PPMO treatment dramatically reduced virus 231 titers in Calu-3 cells, by 1,000-and 4,000-fold at 16 and 24 h p.i., respectively, and 180-fold 232at 48 h p.i.(Fig. 3B).",

The data demonstrate that T-ex5 was very effective at 245 producing exon skipping in TMPRSS2-pre-mRNA and, thus, at inhibiting expression of 246 enzymatically active protease, during the virus growth period in Calu-3 cells. However, a 247 small band of the full-length PCR product was visible after 72 h p.i., indicating low levels of 248 expression of enzymatically active TMPRSS2 at later time points of the virus growth period, 249 which may explain the increase in virus titers observed at 48 h p.i. (cf. Fig. 3B). Cell viability 250 was not affected by T-ex5 PPMO treatment of Calu-3 cells, as shown in Fig. 3D and 251 described previously (B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al., 2011; Limburg et al., 2019). 252 Together, our data identify TMPRSS2 as host cell factor essential for SARS-CoV-2 activation 253 and multiplication in Calu-3 cells and show that downregulation of TMPRSS2 activity 254 dramatically blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication. 255 256 Inhibition of either TMPRSS2 or furin activity suppresses multicycle replication of SARS-257 CoV-2 in human airway epithelial cells 258 We next investigated the efficacy of different inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteases, also 259 inhibiting TMPRSS2, on preventing SARS-CoV-2 activation by TMPRSS2 in Calu-3 cells. We 260 used the natural broad range serine protease inhibitor aprotinin from bovine lung and two 261 prospective peptide mimetic inhibitors of TMPRSS2, MI-432 (Hammami et al., 2012) und MI-262 1900 (Fig. S1). Aprotinin has long been known to prevent proteolytic activation and 263 multiplication of influenza A virus in cell cultures and mice. Furthermore, inhalation of 264 aerosolized aprotinin by influenza patients markedly reduced the duration of symptoms 265 without causing side effects (Zhirnov et al., 2011). MI-432 was shown to efficiently inhibit 266 proteolytic activation and multiplication of influenza A virus in Calu-3 cells (Meyer et al., 267 2013). The inhibitor MI-1900 is a monobasic and structurally related analog of the dibasic 268 inhibitor MI-432. the cells incubated in the presence of the inhibitors at the indicated 272 concentrations for 72 h. The cells were fixed and immunostained using a rabbit antiserum 273 originally produced against SARS-CoV. As shown in Fig. 4, strong CPE and efficient spread 274 of SARS-CoV-2 infection was visible in Calu-3 cells in the absence of protease inhibitors. 275 Spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and virus induced CPE was efficiently inhibited by aprotinin 276 treatment in a dose-dependent manner and only a few infected cells were visible in Calu-3 277 cultures treated with 20-50 \u00b5M aprotinin. Even at lower concentration of 10 \u00b5M the spread of 278 SARS-CoV-2 was greatly reduced and CPE markedly prevented. Treatment with peptide 279 mimetic TMPRSS2 inhibitors MI-432 and MI-1900 also strongly prevented SARS-CoV-2 280 multiplication and CPE in Calu-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner, although less potently 281 than aprotinin. At 20-50 \u00b5M of MI-432 or MI-1900 only small foci of infection were visible. At a 282 concentration of 10 \u00b5M, virus spread and CPE in MI-432 treated cells were still markedly 283 reduced compared to control cells, whereas CPE and spread of infection was observed in 284 the presence of 10 \u00b5M MI-1900, although still reduced compared to control cells. The data 285 demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 multiplication in Calu-3 human airway cells can be strongly 286 suppressed by aprotinin and the synthetic TMPRSS2 inhibitors MI-432 and MI-1900. 287 The observed efficient cleavage of transient expressed SARS-CoV-2 S protein by furin in 288 HEK293 cells prompted us to investigate if furin is involved in SARS-CoV-2 activation in 289 Calu-3 cells. Therefore, virus spread in Calu-3 cells was analysed in the presence of the furin 290inhibitor MI-1851. Interestingly, MI-1851 strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spread at even the 291 lowest concentration of 10 \u00b5M, indicating that furin is critical for SARS-CoV-2 activation and 292 multiplication in these cells(Fig. 4). Finally, to examine whether endosomal cathepsins are 293 involved in SARS-CoV-2 activation in Calu-3 cells, multicycle virus replication was 294 determined in the presence of the cathepsin inhibitor E64d. Cathepsin L was shown to 295 cleave the S protein of 2002 SARS-CoV S close to the S1/S2 site (R667) at T678 in vitro 296(Bosch et al., 2008). Here, strong CPE and foci of infection were observed in E64d-treated 297 cells even at the highest dose of 50 \u00b5M, similar to that observed in DMSO-treated as well as 298 untreated control cells, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 activation in Calu-3 cells is independent 299 of endosomal cathepsins.",

Virus titers in 337 supernatants were determined at indicated time points. Single dose treatment of each 338 inhibitor and untreated cells were used as controls. As shown in Fig. 5C, the combination of 339 10 \u00b5M of MI-1851 with either aprotinin or MI-432 showed enhanced antiviral activity against 340 compared to 50 \u00b5M of each inhibitor alone and thereby dramatically suppressed 344 SARS-CoV-2 multiplication 100-to 250-fold compared to untreated or DMSO treated cells. In 345 contrast, treatment of Calu-3 cells with 50 \u00b5M of MI-1851 and aprotinin did not cause further 346 suppression of virus titers compared to the combination of 10 \u00b5M of each inhibitor. The 347 combination of 10 \u00b5M MI-1851 and MI-1900 did not show enhanced antiviral activity 348 compared to single inhibitor treatments at 10 \u00b5M.

We furthermore examined the 352 antiviral activity of a combination of T-ex5 PPMO and furin inhibitor MI-1851 against SARS-353 CoV-2 in Calu-3 cells. As shown in Fig. 5D, combined treatment of Calu-3 cells with 25 \u00b5M T-354 ex5 PPMO and 50 \u00b5M MI-1851 almost completely blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication with a 355 nearly 40,000-fold reduction in virus titers at 24 h p.i., and reduced virus titers 1,000-fold at 356 48 h p.i. compared to control cells.

Together, our data indicate that furin and TMPRSS2 cleave S at different sites, 405 and, cleavage by both proteases is crucial to render the S protein active for mediating virus 406 entry and membrane fusion (Fig. 6). Iwata-Yoshikawa et al. showed that TMPRSS2-deficient 407 mice do not suffer from pathology when infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Iwata-408 Yoshikawa et al., 2019). The data demonstrated that TMPRSS2 is essential for multicycle 409 replication and spread of these CoVs similar to what we and others have been observed for 410 certain influenza A virus strains (Hatesuer et al., 2013; Tarnow et al., 2014; Sakai et al., 411 2014). However, it remains to be determined whether knockout of TMPRSS2 prevents 412 cleavage of the S proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV at both sites, S1/S2 and S2', or 413 culture, CoVs can enter cells via two distinct routes: the late endosome where S is 416 cleaved by cathepsins or via the cell-surface or early endosome utilizing trypsin-like 417 proteases for S cleavage (Simmons et al., 2005; Bosch et al., 2008; reviewed in Millet and 418 Whittaker, 2015). However, several recent studies revealed that clinical isolates of human 419 CoV (HCoV) achieve activation by trypsin-like serine proteases and utilize endosomal 420 cathepsins only in the absence of suitable trypsin-like proteases in cell culture (Shirato et al., 421 2016, 2018). Thus, activation by cathepsins appears to be a mechanism that is acquired by 422 the virus during multiple passaging in cell cultures (Shirato et al., 2018). Congruently, Zhou 423 et al. showed that SARS-CoV pathogenesis in mice was strongly prevented by camostat, a 424 broad-range inhibitor of trypsin-like serine proteases, but not by inhibitors of endosomal 425 cathepsins (Zhuo et al., 2015). Here, we show that the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d that 426 also inhibits cathepsin L and B did not affect SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 cells, 427 indicating that endosomal cathepsins are dispensable or not involved at all in SARS-CoV-2 428 activation in human airway cells. 429 The presence of a multibasic cleavage site that is processed by ubiquitously expressed furin 430 and, therefore, supports systemic spread of infection, has long been known to be a major 431 determinant of the pathogenicity of HPAIV in poultry (reviewed in Garten and Klenk, 2008). In 432 contrast, the HA of LPAIV is activated at a monobasic cleavage site by trypsin-like serine 433 proteases present in a limited number of tissues limiting spread of infection to these tissues. 434",

Probably, other proteases like the 450 serine protease matriptase/ST14, which also prefers sequences with arginine in P1 and P4 451 position, might be involved. Matriptase is expressed in a broad range of cells and tissues and 452has been shown to activate the HA of H9N2 influenza A viruses possessing the cleavage site 453 motif R-S-S-R (Baron et al., 2013; reviewed inB\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user, 2018). Interestingly, 454 a study byPark et al.  indicated that cleavage of MERS-CoV S by furin or other PCs at the 455 S1/S2 site takes place in virus-producing cells prior to virus release and can impact the 456 cellular localization of membrane fusion and virus entry into a new cell(Park et al., 2016). 457Cleavage of MERS-CoV at the S1/S2 site was postulated as a prerequiste for subsequent 458 cleavage of S at the S2' site by host proteases present at the surface or in early endosomes 459 of human airway cells facilitating virus entry independent of S cleavage by cathepsins in the 460 late endosome. However, other HCoV including the 2002 SARS-CoV are described to be 461 released with non-cleaved S from the infected cell. Hence, S cleavage at both sites, S1/S2 462 and S2', has to take place at the stage of entry for these viruses. 463The present study demonstrates that TMPRSS2 and furin are promising drug targets for the 464 treatment of COVID-19 either by targeting one of these proteases alone or by a combination465 of furin and TMPRSS2 inhibitors. The used TMPRSS2 inhibitors MI-432 and MI-1900 as well 466 as the furin inhibitor MI-1851 provide promising compounds for further drug development. In 467 search for suitable antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infections, protease inhibitors that 468 have been approved for other applications may be promising for drug repurposing to treat 469 COVID-19. Aprotinin is a broad range serine protease inhibitor isolated from bovine lung, 470 which is used as a fibrinolysis inhibitor to reduce perioperative bleeding (reviewed in 471 Steinmetzer et al., 2020) and has long been known to inhibit influenza A virus activation and 472 replication in cell culture and in mice in vivo (Zhirnov et al., 2011). In a clinical trial, inhalation 473 of aerosolized aprotinin in patients with influenza and parainfluenza markedly reduced the 474 duration of symptoms without causing side effects (Zhirnov et al., 2011). Thus, aprotinin is an 475 inhibitor of TMPRSS2 worthy of consideration for further testing and possible development 476 as a therapeutic treatment for COVID-19. Another promising TMPRSS2 inhibitor candidate 477 for COVID-19 treatment is the broad range protease inhibitor camostat. Camostat mesylate 478 is a phenyl-4-guanidinobenzoate derivative originally developed under the name FOY-305 for 479 the treatment of pancreatitis (Tanaka et al., 1979; Midgley et al., 1994) and has been shown 480 to efficiently inhibit replication of different CoV in cell culture and experimentally infected mice 481 (Kawase et al., 2012; Shirato et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2015). Recently, Hoffmann et al. 482 showed that pretreatment of human Caco-2 colon cells and human airway cells with 483 camostat mesylate markedly reduced entry of SARS-CoV-2 as well as VSV pseudotypes 484 containing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Hoffmann et al., 2020). it should be noted that all of these compounds inhibit numerous trypsin-like serine 486 proteases and thus may cause various adverse effects. A specific inhibition of TMPRSS2 487 activity during an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection would provide the most promising approach to 488 reduce side effects by inhibiting virus activation by host cell proteases. TMPRSS2-deficient 489 mice show no discernible phenotype, indicating functional redundancy or compensation of 490 physiological functions by other protease(s) in the host (Kim et al., 2006). Unfortunately, 491 there is no crystal structure of TMPRSS2 available so far, which prohibits a rational structure-492 based design of more efficient inhibitors of this protease. However, first homology models 493 have been established, which may help for the development of improved TMPRSS2 494 inhibitors in the future (Steinmetzer and Hardes, 2018; Rensi et al. https://chemrxiv.org). 495 PPMO are highly selective inhibitors of target gene expression. They bind to a 496 complementary sequence in target mRNA and can affect gene expression by steric blockage 497 of translation initiation or pre-mRNA splicing. The demonstration of T-ex5 PPMO efficacy in 498 the present study suggests that reducing TMPRSS2 expression by use of a mRNA-directed 499 approach in general and by PPMO in particular is worthy of further consideration. 500 Importantly, in various experimental animal models of other viral infections and disease, 501 PPMO were able to be transported to lung tissue after intranasal administration and 502 produced strong reductions in virus growth and virus-induced pathology (Gabriel et al., 2008; 503 Lupfer et al,. 2008, Lai et al,. 2008; Opriessnig et al., 2011). 504 Very effective furin inhibitors containing a C-terminal 4-amidinobenzylamide residue have 505 been developed in recent years. Several of these analogues have been successfully used to 506 inhibit the replication of numerous furin dependent human pathogenic viruses like H5N1 507 influenza A virus, Chikungunya virus, West-Nile virus and Dengue-2 virus, Mumps virus or 508 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (reviewed in Steinmetzer and Hardes, 2018; Kr\u00fcger et al., 509 2018; Van Lam van et al., 2019). So far, these inhibitors have only been used in virus 510 infected cell cultures, but not in animal models. However, the less potent furin inhibitor hexa-511 D-arginine has been used in mice and rats to protect them against Pseudomonas aeruginosa 512 Exotoxin A and anthrax toxemia (Sarac et al., 2002, 2004). Therefore, it can be speculated 513 that a specific furin inhibition in the respiratory tract and lung by inhalative treatment of e.g. 514 MI-1851 or structurally related compounds could be possible without severe side reactions, 515 despite many physiological functions of furin. 516Here, the combination of the TMPRSS2 inhibitors aprotinin or MI-432 with furin inhibitor MI-517 1851 showed enhanced antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in human airway cells and 518 supported strong reduction of virus multiplication at lower doses compared to treatment with 519 each inhibitor alone. Therefore, the combination of TMPRSS2 and furin inhibitors provides a 520 promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections that not only may 521 effects, but may also reduce drug toxicity and undesirable side effects by 522 allowing reductions of the inhibitor doses. Notably, inhibition of TMPRSS2 and furin acts on 523 the same target and our data show that inhibition of S cleavage at one of the two sites is 524 sufficient to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication by reduced production of infectious progeny 525 virus containing inactive S. Thus, the combination of TMPRSS2 and furin inhibitors can act 526 synergistically until S cleavage at one or two sites is completely prevented. The combination 527 of protease inhibitors with antiviral compounds provides an approach that may show even 528 more synergistic antiviral activity at lower drug doses and may furthermore exclude the 529 development of drug resistant viruses. The combination of TMPRSS2 and furin inhibitors,530 respectively, with the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir carboxylate has been shown to 531 block influenza A virus replication in human airway cells at remarkably lower concentration of 532 each inhibitor as compared to single inhibitor treatment (B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al., 533 2012). Combination of a furin inhibitor with oseltamivir carboxylate and the antiviral 534 compounds ribavirin and favipiravir, respectively, efficiently blocked multicycle replication of 535 HPAIV of subtype H5N1 and H7N1 in cell cultures (Lu et al., 2015; Garten et al., 2015). 536",

TMPRSS2 and furin have been shown to 543 be involved in the proteolytic activation of a broad range of viruses. However, the 544 development of host protease inhibitors as a preventative and/or therapeutic strategy for the 545 treatment of virus infections has been minimal to date. Our data demonstrate the high 546 potential of protease inhibitors as drugs for SARS-CoV-2 treatment and highlight the urgent 547 need of drug development and repurposing of potent host protease inhibitors for the 548 treatment of virus infections in general and emerging CoV infections in particular. 549 550 Acknowledgement 551 We are grateful to Christian Drosten for providing the virus.

A monoclonal mouse antibody against the C-terminal 580Myc-tag was purchased from CellSignaling Technology (2276S). A monoclonal mouse anti-581 beta actin antibody was purchased from Abcam (ab6276). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-582 conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from DAKO. 583 584 PPMO. Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) were synthesized at Gene Tools 585 scramble. The cell-penetrating peptide (RXR)4 (where R is arginine and X is 6-588 aminohexanoic acid) was covalently conjugated to the 3` end of each PMO through a 589 noncleavable linker, to produce peptide-PMO (PPMO), by methods described previously 590(Abes et al., 2006). Aprotinin was purchased from AppliChem, the cysteine protease 593inhibitor E64d from Sigma-Aldrich (E8640). The synthetic inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and furin594 were synthesized according to previous methods (Hammami et al., 2012; Hardes et al., 595 2015).

DIPEA, 2 \uf0b4 2 h coupling time) as described 604 recently (Hardes et al., 2013). After final coupling of Boc-2-aminobenzoic acid, the resin was 605 washed with 20 % piperidine in DMF (5 and 15 min) to remove an acylation on the 3-606 nitrotyrosine (Singh et al., 2002). The peptides were cleaved from the resin and deprotected 607 by a mixture of TFA/triisopropylsilane/water (95/2.5/2.5, v/v/v) over 2 h at room temperature, 608 followed by precipitation in cold diethyl ether. All peptides were purified by preparative 609 reversed-phase HPLC to more than 95 % purity based on the detection at 220 nm, and 610 finally obtained as lyophilized TFA-salts. 611 Enzyme kinetic measurements with recombinant soluble human furin 612 The measurements were performed in black 96-well plates (Nunc, Langenselbold) at room 613 temperature with a microplate reader (Safire2, Tecan, Switzerland) at \uf06c ex 320 nm and \uf06c em 405 614 nm.
