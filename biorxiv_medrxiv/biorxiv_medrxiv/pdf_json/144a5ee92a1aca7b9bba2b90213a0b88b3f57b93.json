A clear picture of imaging and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 remains unknown. These manifestations of COVID-19 are protean and usually overlap with those of other viral pneumonia (2, 3) . In the early stage of COVID-19, the main radiological finding is the ground-glass opacity (GGO), especially the pure ground-glass opacity (2) , in the subpleural region, located unilaterally or bilaterally in the lower lobes (3) . The lesions can develop one or more lobes, with a slight preference for the lower right lobe (4) . However, these CT imaging findings are similar to those of influenza pneumonia (5, 6) . The main clinical manifestations of COVID-19, including fever, dry cough, and fatigue, are also non-specific (7, 8) .",

Crazy paving pattern, which also been reported in previous studies (3, 18, 19) , was considered to be the most powerful feature for the differential diagnosis. These two features were also reported in other coronavirus diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) (20, 21) . The pathology of COVID-19 was confirmed to greatly resemble those of SARS and MERS (22, 23) . Tian et al. reported that the lungs of COVID-19 patients exhibited edema, proteinaceous exudate, focal reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes with patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration, and multinucleated giant cells (24) , which can cause the thickening of interlobular septa, and represented as crazy paving pattern. Consistent with previous reports (25) , the pleural effusions are very rare in COVID-19 .

Of all quantitative imaging features, COVID-19 patients have a greater total number of pure GGO (P = 0.01), total number of pure GGO in peripheral area (P = 0.003), total number of mixed GGO in peripheral area (P=0.016), and total number of more lesions are between 1 cm to 3 cm (P = 0.005) in COVID-19 patients. For all qualitative imaging features, most COVID patients present higher positive rate of interlobular septal thickening (54.79%), crazy paving pattern (52.05%), offending vessel augmentation in lesions (72.60%) and lower positive rate of pleural traction (47.95%), emphysema (8.22%), pleural effusions (0.00%), lymphadenopathy (0.00%). The ranking of these features was shown in Figure 3. Compared to the COVID-19 patients, the decreased positive rate of interlobular septal thickening (35.42%), crazy paving pattern (14.58%), offending vessel augmentation in lesions (52.08%), as well as increased positive rate of pleural traction (72.92%), emphysema(20.83%), pleural effusions (20.83%), lymphadenopathy (8.83%) are more pronounced in influenza virus infection patients (all P< 0.05).",

Consistent with previous reports, we found that over 56 percent of influenza patients had positive consolidation, while the positive rate is only 23 percent for COVID-19 patients in the early stage.

Of all the patients, including 24 from Huizhou city, 25 from Shantou city, 15 from Yongzhou city and 9 from Meizhou city, the mean age was 41.9 years (range: 3 -69 years). Among them, 41 patients were men (mean age: 41.4 years; range: 16 -69 years) and 32 were women (mean age: 42.6 years; range: 3 -66 years). In addition, from January 1 2015 to September 30 2019, a total of 205 consecutive patients confirmed with influenza pneumonia from Shantou and Meizhou city were recruited. Figure 1 showed the patient recruitment pathway for the influenza pneumonia group, along with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. According to the 2019-2020 guide from the Chinese center for disease control and prevention (13), 137 patients were confirmed to have influenza A virus infection, 68 patients with influenza B virus infection. 101 patients with influenza A virus infection and 56 patients with influenza B virus infection were excluded because of they did not have chest CT or clinical data. Finally, 48 influenza pneumonia patients (mean age: 40.4 years, range: 0.1 -83 year) were enrolled as controls, including 30 men (mean age: 40.1 years; range: 0.1 -72 years) and 18 women (mean age:40.8 years; range: 0.1 -83 years).
