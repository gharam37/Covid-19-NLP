Furthermore, Hydroxychloroquine showed a significant effectiveness to kill intracellar pathogens such as Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever (22) . The French open label non-randomized clinical trial was promising and the first clinical trial of these medication on COVID-19 patients. The effect of Hydroxychloroquine was significant because it showed reduction in the viral load when it compared with the control group (22) . Moreover, the effect of Hydroxychloroquine was significantly more effective when azithromycin was added to the patients according to their clinical needs. However, clinical follow-up and occurrence of adverse effects were not discussed in the paper; further work should be done on these medicines to reduce the spread of . Although these two medicines have shown promising activity against SARSCoV-2, there is a risk of arrhythmia associated with their requiring caution for use at higher cumulative dosages.
