We pooled 8 trials for the outcome of ARI. Hand hygiene showed a 16% relative reduction in the number of participants with ARI (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.86) in the intervention group. When we considered the more strictly defined outcomes of ILI and influenza, the RR for ILI was 0.98 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.14), and for influenza the RR was 0.91 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.34). Three trials measured absenteeism. We found a 36% relative reduction in absentee numbers in the hand hygiene group (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.71).

Funding for relevant trials with an emphasis on adherence and compliance with such a measure is crucial to inform policy and global pandemic preparedness with confidence and precision.",

Due to the nature of the interventions being compared, blinding of treatment allocation after randomisation was rarely achieved. Most outcomes were assessed by study participants. This meant that outcome assessment was not blinded and therefore at high risk of bias. Some studies had laboratoryconfirmed outcomes which we considered were likely to be at low risk of bias. We found no evidence of selective reporting of outcomes within the included studies. We believe publication bias is unlikely, as the included studies demonstrated a range of effects, both positive and negative, over all sizes of study. Risk of bias assessment for individual studies are shown on forest plots (Figures 2, 3 , S1, S2 and S3). Figure 4 presents an overall summary of risk of bias for included studies.

These trials looked at interventions such as soap and water, hand sanitiser, body wash and skin wipes, with or without additional hygiene education. One trial [41] compared different frequencies of handwashing in a kindergarten and found that compulsory handwashing every hour with an alcohol-based hand gel reduced absenteeism due to ILI more than handwashing every two hours or handwashing just before lunch. Morton et al [42] showed that using an alcohol gel as an adjunct to handwashing was more effective than handwashing alone in a primary school setting. However, this was not confirmed in another trial where both groups also received hygiene education [43]. found no difference between soap and water and an alcohol-based hand rub. In low-income neighbourhoods in Pakistan, plain soap was equally effective as antibacterial soap in preventing ARIs in children aged under 5 years [45].",

However, when considering the more strictly-defined outcomes of influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-confirmed influenza (influenza) [15, 16, 20, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] , the results were heterogeneous and not as strongly in favour of hand hygiene (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.14 for ILI; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.34 for influenza). Three trials quantified absenteeism from school or work [17, 23, 30] and demonstrated a 36% relative reduction in the absentee numbers in the hand hygiene group (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.71). All 15 trials could be pooled for analysis of the composite outcome 'ARI or ILI or influenza', each study contributing the most comprehensive outcome reported only once. This showed a statistically significant 10% relative reduction of participants with a respiratory illness in favour of hand hygiene (95% CI 0.84 to 0.96) but with high heterogeneity (Figure 2 ).",

All four trials were conducted in low-income countries in settings with minimal to no access to basic sanitation. In one trial in 100 primary schools in Laos [59] clean water supply, sanitation facilities, handwashing equipment and drinking water filters were provided to the intervention schools as part of a Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programme with hygiene education. The control schools received the intervention after the trial period. They did not find an effect on infections or absenteeism amongst the students and conclude that such interventions alone are insufficient. The study by Huda et al [60] in villages in Bangladesh used local 'promotors' to visit households with young children regularly to deliver hygiene education including handwashing, latrine use, faeces and waste disposal, and water storage. Although the intervention households showed more 'desired behaviour' this did not result in a measurable reduction of respiratory illness. In another study in urban Bangladesh [61] , handwashing equipment (bucket, tap, soap) and point-of-use water treatment were provided to intervention households and community health promotors delivered a behavioural intervention in addition to an oral cholera vaccine. There was no impact of this large-scale intervention on respiratory illness.",

The earliest review by Rabie et al in 2006 [70] included 8 studies and only 3 were randomised trials. Although each individual study was suggestive of an impact of handwashing on ARI, the pooled estimate of 7 studies was described as \"indicative\", as studies were few, of poor quality, and limited in geographical scope. The review by Warren-Gash, 2013 [71] included 16 studies (10 were randomised trials), showed mixed results with inconclusive. Wong et al [72] identified 10 RCTs and reported that the combination of hand hygiene with facemasks in the developed countries only (5 trials) had statistically significant effect on reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza (RR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.53 to 0.99; I2 = 0%; p = 0.05) and ILI outcomes (RR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.68 to 0.90; I2 = 0%; p = 0.0008), while hand hygiene alone did not show significant reduction in respiratory outcomes. This significant reduction in ILI and influenza for hand hygiene and facemasks was possibly based on the raw numbers without considering any cluster effects in the included cluster trials which produced narrow confidence intervals and possibly biased treatment effect estimates. Moreover, trials from the less developed countries were not included in the review and this significant effect was not sustained when all the trials identified in the review were combined. [73] reviewed all the studies on the effectiveness of personal protective measures (PPM) in interrupting pandemic influenza transmission but identified only 2 randomised trials [46] [78] which reported a significant effect of hand hygiene. In a recent review by Moncion et al [74] , 7 randomised trials of hand hygiene compared to control were identified but the majority did not find statistically significant differences in SARs for laboratory-confirmed or possible influenza between hand hygiene and control groups. Systematic reviews of RCTs on hand hygiene interventions among children [75] [76] or at a non-clinical workplace [77] , identified heterogeneous trials with quality issues including small numbers of clusters and participants, inadequate randomisation and self-reported outcomes.",

First, the high heterogeneity means there may be substantial differences in the effect of different interventions. The poor reporting limited our ability to extract the information needed to assess any \"dose response\" relationship. Second, the sustainability of hand washing is unclear: some programmes achieved 5 to 10 hand washings per day, but compliance may diminish with time, as motivation decreases or because of adverse effects from frequent hand washing. Third, there is still little information on combinations of hand washing with other interventions, and how those are best introduced and sustained. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, most interventions were intensive within small organisations, and the ability to scale these up to national-level interventions is unclear.",

There is also considerable variation across trials, suggesting a different impact across implementation methods and settings. More research is urgently needed into the sources of variability of these effects. However, given the low cost and minimal disruption from good hand washing behaviour, we believe this small effect warrants continued promotion as part of a combined strategy to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. No single strategy -other than prolonged isolation of the entire population -can block an epidemic spread. The alternative is combining multiple, partially effective interventions, such as hand washing, crowd reduction, or self-isolation of symptomatic patients, etc. This model is used in medical error reduction, where a common analogy is the \"Swiss cheese model\" whereby enough slices of cheese are needed to prevent the holes lining up, and an error occurring. Hand washing is clearly not a complete solution but adds one important layer of a combined strategy to reduce respiratory viral transmission. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",
