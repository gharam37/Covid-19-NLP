This has been interpreted as the liquids disrupting the surface charge on the fibers and has led to a recent CDC/NIOSH advisory against using alcohol for their decontamination. We have replicated the drop in efficiency after alcohol treatment. However, we find that the efficiency can be recovered by more effective drying, which we achieve with a vacuum chamber. Drying at pressures of < ~6 mBar (0.6 kPa) restores the measured filtering efficiency to within 2% or so of the pre-washing value, which we have sustained for 5 cleaning-drying cycles so far in three models of N95 masks. The mechanism seems to be the removal of water molecules adsorbed on the fiber surfaces, a hypothesis which is supported by two independent observations: (A) the filtering efficiency increases non-linearly with the weight loss during drying, and (B) filtration efficiency shows an abrupt recovery as the vacuum pressure drops from 13 to 6 mBar, the range physically attributable to the removal of adsorbed water. These results are not compatible with the electrostatic discharge hypothesis, and rather suggest that water molecules adsorbed to the fiber surface are reducing the filtration efficiency via surface tension interactions (e.g., wicking between the fibers and coating their surfaces with a film).",

Our study has found that this cleaning process can be used on a mask at least five times without altering the filter rate of the mask by more than one per cent. Vacuum-drying the masks removes a thin layer of water that still sticks to the fibers in the mask after air-drying. This layer of water is probably what causes the mask efficiency to drop (that is, how well it filters particles from the air). There is a danger that if the mask gets wet in other ways that it will not filter the air as well. This could also be fixed with the vacuum-drying procedure.",

During use in clinical settings, the filters may become contaminated with active viral or bacterial particles, necessitating that any efforts to refurbish them should employ decontamination techniques in addition to cleaning. Such techniques could ease the supply demand and immediately aid medical personnel treating COVID-19 patients, many of whom currently have no choice but to reuse dirty devices that have unknown filtering efficiency. There is a need for simple methods for using equipment commonly available in most hospital and clinical environments to enable safe reuse of masks. If found, such methods would rapidly ease this critical shortage even in resource-constrained settings.",

Instead, this washing procedure appears to leave a film of water molecules adsorbed hygroscopically on the surface that reduces the particulate absorption efficiency; approximately 2-4 g of water remains firmly on a typical respirator even after extensive air drying due to the large surface area of the fibers. We found that this layer of adsorbed water can be removed by further drying in a partial vacuum to below 6 mBar (0.6 kPa), after which we observe the filtration efficiency returning to within 2% of the original values. As shown in Table 2 , we have repeated this on three different types of N95 respirators for five cycles and see no long-term degradation at this time.",

These units sample air at ambient pressure with a small pump, running it through the laser detectors and counting particles in the four size bins. In order to use this to sample the air passing through a filter, we constructed a testing facility as shown in Fig. 1 . We wrapped a Styrofoam bust of a human head (previously used as an EEG blank) in three layers of ordinary kitchen plastic wrap to give surface friction and pliancy, drilled a vent hole \"mouth\", and placed the N95 respirators over the opening. This setup was housed inside a Plexiglass box, which was then pressurized with 'dirty' Pasadena air (the pressurized box reached ~2,000,000 particles > 0.3 \u03bcm/cf) using an industrial heat gun dryer (a Gilson TM MA-290F) in non-heat mode, mounted to the side. Air passed through the filters and then exited through a PVC pipe, which was sampled by the particle counter at ambient pressure. The air then flowed through a 2 m length of plastic hose to minimize backflow of outside air into the counter from turbulence. The flow rate through the mask was adjusted using the intake manifold on the heat gun to ~23 l/min.",

Although we did not use standard ASHRAE aerosol procedures, data from the experimental setup, shown in Fig. 1 , are in agreement with those procedures and verify the utility of our experimental setup. Similarly, the N95 respirators dropped in efficiency by 20-30% following alcohol cleaning; this is consistent with previously reported results 3, 4 . Table 2 shows the results from five cycles of alcohol decontamination / drying that were conducted on three varieties of 3M TM N95 respirators (3M TM 8200, 8210 and 8511 masks). After these cycles, all masks remained at or above 95% filtration efficiency. As of this writing have conducted 18 wet/dry/vacuum cycles on 6 different masks, all of which drop in performance after wetting, but return to within 99% of their initial filtration efficiency after vacuum treatment to < 6 mBar.",

Our data point to a mechanism based on surface wetting, which is reversible by drying. It is well known that in order to remove water molecules that are trapped or adsorbed on solid surfaces the pressure of the vacuum chamber must be reduced to a value that is below the saturation vapor pressure of water; lower pressures will thin the adsorbed water layer. We note that the saturated vapor pressure of ethanol and water at 20\u02daC are 58 and 23 mBar respectively. When water molecules are adsorbed to surfaces in vacuum chambers, pressures as low as 1-20 mBar are needed to remove them 9 . Hence, our data suggest that water bound to the surface of the fibers is responsible for the loss in filtering efficiency, as evidenced by our observation of the same effect in a respirator soaked in DI water. This surface wetting mechanism for performance degradation is consistent with the nature of the mask materials. The active material of the 3M TM N95 masks is melt-blown, fibrous polypropylene modified by corona discharge to contain embedded charges 4, 10 . SEM indicates that the diameters of the fibrous strands are on the order of ~1 \u03bcm 11 , giving the filter a huge specific surface area. When the fibers are cleaned and rinsed with the ethanol solution, thin liquid films are introduced onto the material. The surface tension of the liquid film causes the fibers to wick together and form bundles, thereby opening gaps. In addition, the clumping of individual fibers significantly reduces the surface area available for .

If some of the water is actually adsorbed onto the fibers, though, then this would cause the wicking and other effects. While absorbed microdroplets may evaporate easily due to their large surface area, the adsorbed water will not dry so easily.

Our adsorbed water mechanism would explain this result. In the first cycles, moisture would have accumulated harmlessly at lower levels, with the water retained as microdroplets between the fibers. By the fifth cycle, a critical point may have been reached, with droplets merging and adsorbing onto the fibers, causing them to 'wick' together.

In contrast, our testing setup uses a head model, upon which the mask is \"worn\", and is remarkably quick and easy to seal completely against the plastic film wrapped around the head model. We are seeking to improve upon this with 3D-printed head models and synthetic skin coverings (e.g. 21 ). Such an improved version could then be used to validate inexpensive head forms for testing rigs.",

Application of heat as suggested by Liao et al. 3 , for example, may impact the thermoplastics that line the edges of many masks.

We replicated previous reports that alcohol-based decontamination could result in a decrease in efficiency of ~40% after air-drying. As of this writing, we have conducted 18 wet/dry/vacuum cycles on 6 different masks, all of which drop in performance after wetting, but return to within 98% of their initial filtration efficiency after vacuum treatment to < 6 mBar. In addition, this restoration has been verified for up to 5 cleaning cycles on the N95 rated 3M TM 8200, 8210 and 8511 masks.",

In addition, water adsorbed on the surface of the microfibers might interfere with their electrostatic interactions. The vacuum treatment fully dries the mask, allowing the fibers to spring back to their original arrangement, and restores the available surface area so that the electrostatic fibers are effective in capturing the micron and submicron size particles. Because moisture can accumulate in masks as they are used, mask performance might degrade even absent a decontamination treatment. If so, conditioning processes for extending the usable life of masks, even ones that do not involve water, should completely dry the masks in order to counteract any adsorbed water that may have accumulated during extended use.",

The rapid increase in filtering efficiency as pressure drops below ~13 mBar is evidence for the removal of water molecules adsorbed to the surface of the microfibers; many studies of moisture removal from vacuum systems have shown that pressures in this range are necessary for this 9 .
