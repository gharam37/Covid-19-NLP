France is the third country of the EU for number of cases but a jump in the data on April 3, 2020 does not allow, at least for the moment, to have a reliable prediction curve. The analysis is based on the use of a function of the type of a Gauss Error Function, with four parameters, as a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). A Monte Carlo analysis is used to estimate the uncertainty. The approach used in this paper is mathematical and statistical and thus does not explicitly consider a number of relevant issues, including number of nasopharyngeal swabs, mitigation measures, social distancing, virologic, epidemiological and models of contamination diffusion.",

The data have been collected in the web sites of the World Health Organization 1 , Worldometer 2 and Italian \"Ministero della Salute\" 3 . On the basis of our previous analyses of the cumulative diagnosed positive cases in China and Italy 4,5 , we found that the distributions of the positive cases and of fatalities can well be approximated by a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the type of the Gauss Error Function with four parameters. The Gauss Error Function is the integral of a normal, Gaussian distribution and has been used in similar studies 6, 7, 8 . It is assumed that the diagnosed cases are a good statistical representation of the entire population of the much larger positive cases. The number of fatalities is probably more reliable than the number of positive cases since they usually occur in the hospital. There is an obvious uncertainty also for those occurrences since there are fatalities, not occurring in the hospital, associated with several severe and/or chronic diseases in which coronavirus could have had a role but that could not be diagnosed. We have analyzed the following seven countries of the European Union: Spain, Italy, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands, Austria and Portugal. France, that is the third country for number of positive cases within the EU, however it was not reported here because the fitting of the data does not look too accurate due to a jump in the number of cases diagnosed around April 3, 2020. We have also performed 25000 of Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the uncertainty in the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic in those countries.",

So, we can reasonably assume that on average every 5.57 tests (nasopharyngeal swabs) 1 positive case is diagnosed. On April 7, the new positive cases were 3039. We have assumed (see section on the Monte Carlo simulation) an uncertainty in the daily data of 10% which we may consider half due to the uncertainty in the number of tests (nasopharyngeal swabs) that will be performed in the days to come and the other 5% due to other uncertainties. Therefore, it may be acceptable in the case of Italy a variation in the number of daily tests of less than 0,05*3039*5,57=846 tests/day. A higher rate in the daily variation of tests will introduce a systematic bias that could bring the prediction outside the 2-sigma or even 3-sigma range. The systematic bias becomes more severe if all the changes are monotonic (as it seems the case in Italy where the number of daily nasopharyngeal swabs is increasing). Analogous calculation can be done for the other countries that we do not report here for brevity. Consequently, the numbers reported in the table as +/-2-sigma or +/-3-sigma are valid with the limitations just described.",

The crossing of the curves in Fig. 1 shows that Italy had a higher number of positive cases from the beginning. However, the number of positive cases in Spain started to grow faster as shown by the larger derivative of the red curve. This fast grow of cases in Spain was reported for several days in the news. Fig. 6 shows a much smaller number of fatalities for Germany and for this reason a substantial reduction of fatalities will occur a little earlier than for Italy. For all countries the flex point of the positive cases occurs always after Italy as one would expect. Austria is the country with the lowest number of cases (Fig. 8) . In the case of the fatalities of Austria and Portugal, the numerical procedure did not converge so that the flex point is not available. Concerning the substantial reduction of positive cases, the threshold for the other EU countries, with respect to the value 100 chosen for Italy, was multiplied for a normalization factor taking into account the cumulative number of positive cases and of fatalities in Italy and in the other EU nations.",

The day of a substantial reduction in the number of daily positive cases or fatalities (which, for example, we took for Italy to be less than 100, while for the other countries such value was suitably scaled), does not always occur first for Italy. The predictions discussed in this paper are statistical in nature and do not explicitly take into account the relevant factors of number of nasopharyngeal swabs, social distancing, and epidemiological and virology studies",
