Here, we present a modification of the classical SI model, the Fractal Kinetics SI model which is in excellent agreement with the disease outbreak data available from the World Health Organization. The fractal kinetic approach that we propose here originates from chemical kinetics and has successfully been used in the past to describe reaction dynamics when imperfect mixing and segregation of the reactants is important and affects the dynamics of the reaction. The model introduces a novel epidemiological parameter, the \"fractal\" exponent h which is introduced in order to account for the self-organization of the societies against the pandemic through social distancing, lockdowns and flight restrictions.",

Its mortality is apparently higher compared with a mortality rate of less than 1% from influenza (1) . There is an urgent need to model the growth of COVID-19 worldwide. The classical epidemiological approach for the study of growth relies on the reproduction number and infection time, which leads to an exponential growth. However, the data accumulated so far indicate deviation of growth from this pattern. Various approaches to model COVID-19 epidemics have been published in the literature recently based on various hypotheses (2, 3) Our model follows the principles of fractal kinetics (4) which is suitable for chemical reactions under \"topological constraints\" e.g. insufficient mixing of the reactant species. In fact, there is a full analogy between the governments measures to ensure social distancing for the control of epidemics and the reactions taking place in low dimensions or insufficient stirring (4) (5) (6) The Model",

We found that c changed by a factor of approximately 10 3 , the relative of a was almost 40% while the exponent h changed only by roughly 7% i.e from 1.37 to 1.27.

Thus, we assume that each country is epidemiologicaly characterized by the three component vector a, c, h. Since Eq. 4 is an approximation it is anticipated that these three parameters are correlated. Thus, we use an unsupervised learning method, namely a Principle Components Analysis(PCA), a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components (14).",
