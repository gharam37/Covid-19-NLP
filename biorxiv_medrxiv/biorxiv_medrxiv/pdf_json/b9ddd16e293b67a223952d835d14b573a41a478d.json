So far, there is none vaccines or specific antiviral drugs approved for that. Therapeutic antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, was obtained from hyper immune equine plasma in this study. Herein, SARS-CoV-2 RBD with gram level were obtained through Chinese hamster ovary cells high-density fermentation. The binding of RBD to SARS-CoV-2 receptor, human ACE2, was verified and the efficacy of RBD in vivo was tested on mice and then on horses. As a result, RBD triggered high-titer neutralizing antibodies in vivo, and immunoglobulin fragment F(ab')2 was prepared from horse antisera through removing Fc. Neutralization test demonstrated that RBD-specific F(ab')2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 at 0.07 \u03bcg/ml, showing a potent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2. These results highlights as RBD-specific F(ab')2 as therapeutic candidate for SARS-CoV-2.",

C Affinity of F(ab')2 to SARS-CoV-2 RBD was detected by BLI, and the kinetics (Kon and Kdis) were processed by an Octet data analysis system. The binding curves were obtained by passing F(ab')2 at concentrations from 4000 to 62.5 nM over biotinylated RBD immobilized on a streptavidin biosensor surface. The kinetic values (KD, M) were calculated by deducting from baseline and fitting the association and dissociation responses to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. ",
