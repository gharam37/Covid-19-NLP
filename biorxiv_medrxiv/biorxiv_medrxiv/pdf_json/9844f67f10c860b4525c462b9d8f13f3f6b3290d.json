Delays in testing have slowed the public health response in Europe and the United States, and challenges to testing in low-and middle-income countries are even greater.

In the absence of sufficient RT-PCR capacity, we propose an alternative that may provide this essential data in a way that is coursegrained but at lower cost using the pooling of samples from multiple patients and performing RT-PCR on this combined sample.5-8 If the test is negative, this implies that no one in the pool is infected and if the test is positive, it may be concluded that at least one person in the pool is infected. Pooling and group testing can be very effective in reducing the number of tests required to both identify infected people in a population and to estimate the infection rate in a population. Another benefit of this method is that it is likely to reduce testing time as fewer samples need to be prepped and put through the RT-PCR process. This technique has been shown to be effective in screening for bacteria, parasites and viruses in human health, including HIV,5 Chlamydia, 9 Malaria, 9 and influenza.7 In the agricultural sector, where cost-effectiveness is essential to efficient food production, the epidemiology of various pathogens, including Dichelobacter nodosus, which causes footrot in sheep,10 postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome,11 and antibiotic resistance in swine feces12 has been measured using this method. Pooled sampling and testing via PCR has also been used to successfully identify coronaviruses in multiple bat species.13",

This method of pooling samples has the potential to dramatically reduce the number of tests to be performed and this is likely to be associated with a substantial reduction in costs. In addition, as the sample size grows, it becomes easier to distinguish between high and low prevalence rates. When the sample size is of the order of 1000s, the probability of false alarm and probability of detection are greatly reduced. For example, given 256 samples and a number of samples per pool of 64, just 7.3 tests are needed on average to differentiate 1% prevalence from 5% prevalence with a probability of detection of 95% and a probability of false alarm of 4%.

Pooling of samples can help accelerate the surveillance for COVID-19 identification in a community or group of people living together. If found positive, tracing back to the individual(s) can be done by a pooled sampling exercise. In some countries this technique is already being used to make COVID-19 testing more costeffective. In Israel, researchers at Technion -Israel Institute of Technology and Rambam Health Care Campus successfully identified a positive carrier from a pooled analysis of 64 samples. 16 In the US, the Nebraska Public Health Lab pooled 60 samples obtained from across the state.17 These samples were tested in groups of five, and two groups were found to be positive. The samples from each positive group were then tested individually to identify positive carriers and the use of this technique halved the consumption of reagents. Blood banks commonly use pooled testing, combining 4 to 24 samples in each test and rising to 96 combined specimens when testing plasma fractionation. Pooled testing for COVID-19 could be combined with nucleic acid testing, to screen blood donations and reduce the risk of transfusion transmitted infections, with improved accuracy.",

In the case of SARS, individual tracheal aspirate, a high-risk aerosol generating procedure, had the highest diagnostic yield by RT-PCR, followed by stool samples. Pooled throat and nasal swabs, rectal swab, nasal swab, throat swab, and nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens provided only a moderate yield. Procedures for the collection of stool and pooled nasal and throat swab specimens were the least hazardous, and the combination gave the highest yield for coronavirus detection by RT-PCR.20 For community surveillance of respiratory pathogens among adults and children, self-collected gargle samples have been found to be comparable or even more sensitive than throat swab samples with lower detectable Ct values in RT-PCR21, 22 and less bio-hazardous for collection by community healthcare workers.",

Tests using viral antigens can detect COVID-19 three days after the onset of symptoms, however, in many countries these are not available. Rapid diagnostic tests using antibodies are unable to identify early cases as antibodies are only detectable 6-12 days after patients become symptomatic. In addition, tests using antibodies are not able to distinguish recovered cases from those who are currently infectious, however they may be useful in surveillance for individuals who have been infected with COVID-19.",

When prevalence is high, then it is likely that the optimal size of the pool will have to be very small and the method is unlikely to present a dramatic reduction in resource use. On the other hand, we recommend using the second RT-PCR pooling method proposed to identify individuals only on samples from individuals who exhibit symptoms. The optimal pool size depends on the sensitivity of the test, and this is a function of viral load. Salivary viral load has been found to be highest in the first week after the onset of symptoms.23 While patients are asymptomatic, early in infection, the viral load is low making this technique unlikely to be useful in these individuals.",
