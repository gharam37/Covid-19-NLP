To prevent the escalation of its transmission, China locked down one-third of its cities and strictly restricted personal mobility and economic activities. Using timely and comprehensive air quality data in China, we show that these counter-COVID-19 measures led to a remarkable improvement in air quality. Within weeks, the Air Quality Index and PM2.5 concentrations were brought down by 25%. The effects are larger in colder, richer, and more industrialized cities. We estimate that such improvement would avert 24,000 to 36,000 premature deaths from air pollution on a monthly basis.",

For example, satellite images caught a sharp drop in air pollution in several countries that have taken aggressive measures on the transmission of the virus. 2 In this study, we carry out a rigorous investigation into this issue and estimate how locking down cities affected air quality at a national scale in China. We focus on China for two reasons. First, China was hit hard by the COVID-19 outbreak, and the Chinese government launched draconian countermeasures to prevent the escalation of infections (Chen et al., 2020; Kucharski et al., 2020) . Nearly one-third of Chinese cities were locked down in a top-down manner, and various types of economic activities were strictly prohibited.",

We first collect air quality data from 1,600 monitoring stations covering all the prefectural cities in China and aggregate the station level data to the city level data. We then collect the local government's lockdown policies city by city from news media and government announcements (Appendix Table A1 ). Because the disease prevalence varied greatly across different regions, the terms and requirements of the lockdown also differed across provinces and cities. Thus, we define a city as locked down when all three of the following preventive measures were enforced: 1) prohibition of unnecessary commercial activities in people's daily lives, 2) prohibition of any types of gathering by residents, 3) restrictions on private (vehicle) and public transportation. Following our definition, 95 out of 324 cities were locked down, as described in Figure 1 (Summary Statistics is described in Appendix Table A2 ).",

The DiD model is a wellestablished econometric technique and has been widely applied in understanding the impacts of government policies (Angrist and Pischke, 2008) . In our DiD specification, the city-level air pollution is as a function of the city-specific lock-down policy, city-specific fixed effects that capture city-level time-invariant determinants of air pollution (e.g., geographical conditions, baseline income), month by week fixed effects that capture shocks common to all cities in a given week (e.g., nationwide holiday policy, macroeconomic conditions) and weather conditions (see Appendix Methods). Adopting this method, we can estimate the difference in air pollution levels between the treatment group (locked-down cities) and the control group (non-locked-down cities) before and after city lockdowns in 2020. In addition, because cities without formal lockdown policies might also have been affected by the disease preventive measures (e.g., all cities extended the Spring Festival holiday, required social distancing, and urged people to stay at home), we also apply the DiD model to compare air pollution levels in the control (no-lockdown) cities before and after China's Spring Festival relative to the previous year. 3 Combining these two sets of DiD results, we can evaluate the total effects of city lockdown on air quality.",

We see the AQI levels were almost equivalent before the Spring Festival in 2019 and 2020, implying the parallel trend assumption is likely to hold. In 2020, shortly after the festival, we observe that the air pollution levels became slightly lower, relative to the 2019 post-festival season. This result suggests that air quality in the control cities marginally improved, although they were not formally locked down. Table 1 summarizes the regression results. Here, we estimate the relative change in air pollution levels in the treatment group (locked-down cities) relative to the control group (non-locked-down cities) by fitting the DiD model described in the equation (A1). We find that a lockdown indeed improved the air quality: compared to cities without formal lockdown policies, the weekly Air Quality Index (AQI) and PM2.5 declined respectively by 19.4 points (18%) and 13.9 \u00b5g/m 3 (17%) when including weather controls and a set of fixed effects (in columns (2) and (4)). 4 These estimates are remarkably robust to the inclusion of weather variables, indicating that the changes in air pollution caused by city lockdown are not correlated with weather conditions. We also provide the results for other air pollutants (Appendix Table A3) In Columns (5) to (8), we estimate the changes in air pollution levels in the control (nolockdown) cities before and after the Spring Festival relative to the previous year by fitting the second DiD model described in the equation (A3). We find that air quality in 2020 improved relative to the previous year's air quality after the Festival. The results show that 4 The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a comprehensive measure of air pollution in China and also widely used around the world.

The counter-virus measures also negatively affected the economy and employment, which are detrimental to population health. In such cases, excess deaths could be caused by economic consequences than were saved by reduced pollution. In contrast, as the pandemic also signficantly increased individuals' awareness of their health conditions and made people practice good hygiene, the counter-virus measures might reduce deaths from other diseases, particularly influenza. 7 While estimating the overall mortality impact of COVID-19 and city lockdown is beyond the scope of our paper, future research on these issues is warranted to understand the full implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

We include leads of the treatment dummy in the equation, testing whether the treatment affects the air pollution levels before the launch of the policy. Intuitively, the coefficient 4 @ measures the difference in air quality between cities under lockdown and otherwise in period . relative to the difference one year before the lockdown. We expect lockdown would improve air quality with 4 @ being negative when . \u2265 0. If the parallel trend assumption holds, 4 @ would be close to zero when . \u2264 \u22122.",
