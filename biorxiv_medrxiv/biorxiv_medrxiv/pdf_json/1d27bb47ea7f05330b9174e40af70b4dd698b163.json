On March 16 th 2020, we presented a Position Paper proposing a research hypothesis concerning the association between higher mortality rates due to COVID-19 observed in Northern Italy and the peaks of particulate matter concentrations, frequently exceeding the legal limit of 50 \u00b5g/m 3 as PM 10 daily average Methods: To assess environmental factors related to the spread of the COVID-19 in Italy from February 24 th to March 13 th (the date when the lockdown has been imposed over Italy), official daily data relevant to ambient PM 10 levels were collected from all Italian Provinces between February 9 th and February 29 th , taking into account the average time (estimated in 17 days) elapsed between the initial infection and the recorded COVID positivity. In addition to the number of exceedances of PM 10 daily limit value, we considered also population data and daily travelling information per each Province. Results. PM 10 daily limit value exceedances appear to be a significant predictor (p < .001) of infection in univariate analyses. Less polluted Provinces had a median of 0.03 infection cases over 1000 residents, while most polluted Provinces had a median of 0.26 cases over 1000 residents. Thirty-nine out of 41 Northern Italian Provinces resulted in the category with highest PM 10 levels, while 62 out of 66 Southern Provinces presented low PM 10 concentrations (p< 0.001). In Milan, the average growth rate before the lockdown was significantly higher than Rome (0.34 vs. 0.27 per day, with a doubling time of 2.0 days vs. 2.6), suggesting a basic reproductive number R 0 >6.0, comparable with the highest values estimated for China.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome known as COVID-19 disease (due to SARS-CoV-2 virus), is recognized to spread via respiratory droplets and close contacts [1] . However, this unique transmission model does not seem to explain properly the different spread observed in Italy from February 24th, 2020 to March 13rd, 2020. The huge virulence of COVID19 in the Po Valley is not comparable to the milder contagiousness observed in the central-southern regions. Demographic factors related to the ageing of the population and the possibility of infection without clinical symptoms for a quite long time -associated with the high rate of asymptomatic people that characterize COVID-19, estimated in 50-75% of infections -may only partially explain the fast spreading of the virus in Lombardy and Northern Italy [2, 3] . Cai et al (2020) reported different incubation periods in patient(s) infected in Wuhan [4] , but an epidemic model based only on respiratory droplets and close contact could not fully explain the regional differences in the spreading of the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19 in Italy, which was fast and dramatic only in Lombardy and Po Valley.",

Paules et al. (2020) highlighted that -besides close distance contacts -airborne transmission of SARS-CoV can also occur [5] . It has also been reported how for some pathogens the airborne transport can reach long distances [6] [7] [8] . Reche et al. (2018) described the aerosolization of soil-dust and organic aggregates in sea spray that facilitates the long-range transport of bacteria, and likely of viruses free in the atmosphere. In particular, virus deposition rates were positively correlated with organic aerosol <0.7 \u00b5m, implying that viruses could have longer persistence times in the atmosphere and, consequently, will be dispersed further [9] . Moreover Qin et al. (2020) analyzed the microbiome of the airborne particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10 ) in Beijing over a period of 6 months in 2012 and 2013, putting in evidence a variability of the composition that depended on the months [10] . Temporal distribution of the relative abundance of the microbiome on the particulate matter (PM) showed the highest presence of viruses in January and February, just in coincidence with most severe PM pollution. Chen. et al (2017) demonstrated the relationship between short-term exposure PM 2.5 concentration and measles incidence in 21 cities in China [11] . Their meta-analyses showed that the nationwide measles incidence was significantly associated with an increase of 10 \u00b5g/m 3 in PM 2.5 levels.",

The condensation and stabilization of the bioaerosol, generating aggregates with atmospheric particles from primary (i.e. dust) and secondary particulate, has been indicated as mechanisms able to transport airborne bacteria and viruses to distant regions, even by the inter-continent- [15] ; Brown et al (1935) found that the most severe measles epidemic in the United States occurred in Kansas in 1935 during the Dust Bowl period [16] .",

The number of PM 10 infected people for each Province from February 24 th to March 13 th (the date when the lockdown was decided) was that reported on the official Government website, updated with daily frequency [24] . PM 10 exceedances were collected between February 9 th and February 29 th , taking into account the lag period, which is the average time elapsed between the initial infection and the diagnosis. To investigate how high PM 10 concentrations (above the daily limit value) might relate to infection diffusion, we performed an exploratory analysis considering the recursive binary partitioning tree approach, as implemented into the party package [25] of R [26] .",

As response variable we considered the infection rate of the disease, expressed as a proportion obtained binding together into a single two-dimensional vector both the number of COVID-19 cases and the rest of the Province population.

Airborne transmission is certainly more effective in indoor environments, with little ventilation, but it must be considered that the Po Valley, by its atmospheric stability, closely resembles a confined environment and that long-distance virus transport is favored by high concentration of dusts. However, the highly diluted nature of viral bioaerosol in ambient air has been considered a major impediment to viral aerobiological detection -including the investigation of viral interactions with other airborne particles -despite bioaerosol is a well-known factor for the virus transmission via airborne. Recently, Groulx et al. (2018) , using an in vitro PM concentrator, suggested that the interaction between airborne viruses and airborne fine particulate matter influence viral stability and infectivity [31] . The stability of aerosol and condensation reactions occur frequently in atmosphere, as organic aerosol change the properties (hygroscopicity, toxicity, optical properties) of other aerosol [32] .",

However, the trends presented a similar behavior up to 8 days; after the days, the increase of the COVID-19 incidences showed a sudden acceleration of the viral infectivity Milan. Besides the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurring via a close contact with infected peop through the direct inhalation of liquid droplets emitted by coughs or exhalations and/or by the conta with surfaces contaminated by the virus, the dynamic of COVID-19 incidence observed in Milan withcompared to that of Rome -suggested also to consider possible route of transmission by airborne route longer distance.

The infection rate of disease has been higher in Milan, (1.35 million inhabitants, Northern Italy) than in Rome (2.87 million inhabitants, Southern Italy), even if there has not been a substantial difference in urban management and social confinement as well as in ageing index of the two populations. Our research hypothesis is that the acceleration of the growth rate observed in Milan could be attributed to a \"boost effect\" (a kind of exceptional \"super-spread event\") on the viral infectivity of COVID-19, corresponding to the peaks of particulate matter. These first observations suggest that particulate matter could be regarded as an indicator of the severity of COVID-19 infection in terms of diffusion and health outcomes. The other hypothesis is that PM could act as a carrier for droplet nuclei, triggering a boost effect on the spread of the virus (Figure 5). It could be possible to look at the airborne route of transmission, and specifically to particulate matter, as a \"highway \" for the viral diffusion, in which the droplet nuclei emitted by the exhalations are stabilized in the air through the coalescence of aerosol with the PM at high concentrations in stability conditions. In fact, the fate of a small droplet of a virus, under normal conditions of clean air and atmospheric turbulence, evaporates and /or disperses quickly in atmosphere. On the contrary in conditions of atmospheric stability and high concentrations of PM, viruses have a high probability of creating clusters with the particles and, by reducing their diffusion coefficient, enhancing their residence time and amount in atmosphere and promoting contagion.",
