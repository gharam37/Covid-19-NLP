            "text": "We have analyzed the COVID19 epidemic data of more than 174 countries (excluding China) in the period between January 22 and March 28, 2020. We found that some countries (such as the US, the UK, and Canada) follow an exponential epidemic growth, while others (like Italy and several other European countries) show a power law like growth. At the same time, regardless of the best fitting law, most countries can be shown to follow a trajectory similar to that of Italy, but with varying degrees of delay. We found that countries with \"younger\" epidemics tend to exhibit more exponential like behavior, while countries that are closer behind Italy tend to follow a power law growth. We hypothesize that there is a universal growth pattern of this infection that starts off as exponential and subsequently becomes more power law like. Although it cannot be excluded that this growth pattern is a consequence of social distancing measures, an alternative explanation is that it is an intrinsic epidemic growth law, dictated by a spatially distributed community structure, where the growth in individual highly mixed communities is exponential but the longer term, local geographical spread (in the absence of global mixing) results in a power-law. This is supported by computer simulations of a metapopulation model that gives rise to predictions about the growth dynamics that are consistent with correlations found in the epidemiological data. Therefore, seeing a deviation from straight exponential growth may not be a consequence of working nonpharmaceutical interventions (except for, perhaps, restricting the air travel). Instead, this is a normal course of raging infection spread. On the practical side, this cautions us against overly optimistic interpretations of the countries epidemic development and emphasizes the need to continue improving the compliance with social distancing behavior recommendations.",

The overall mortality rate further depends on the prevalence of the infection in the population: Once the number of infected individuals has reached sufficiently large sizes, health care systems become overwhelmed and lose the capacity to treat all patients in need [4] . In particular, the number of respirator units poses an important limitation, which has resulted in difficult triaging policies in some countries, most notably Italy and Spain. Non-pharmaceutical intervention methods, such as social distancing, have become an important tool in the fight against coronavirus spread [5] . The idea is to slow down the rate at which the virus spreads through human populations, and thus to maintain the number of infected individuals that require treatment below a threshold level, thus avoiding a situation in which hospitals become overwhelmed. Hence, wide-spread closures of schools and businesses, and stay-home orders, have been implemented across Asia, America, Europe, and other affected regions.",

The pattern of virus spread was found to be approximately exponential, at least during the early stages of virus spread [6, 7] , and importantly, the basic reproductive ratio of the virus has been estimated [8, 9, 10, 11] . The implementation of social distancing measures are expected to have a significant impact on the virus spread kinetics [5] , which has been observed in some Asian countries, such as China [12] . While the effect of containment efforts have been very pronounced in these countries, they might be more subtle in other countries across the globe, especially during the initial phase following their implementation. To better assess observed virus spread trajectories following the implementation of social distancing measures, a more detailed understanding of the basic kinetics of virus spread in different countries is required. While the virus spread pattern is often quoted to be exponential [6, 7] , power law patterns have been reported in data from China [13] .",

Interestingly, we find that as per capita infections grow towards larger numbers, the growth pattern deviates from exponential and is better described by a power law. This can be hypothesized to be due to social distancing measures [5] , or potentially to the build-up of immunity in the population [14] . We show, however, that the longer term per capita infection levels over time across a wide array of countries can be remarkably similar, and follow the same power law trajectory as seen in countries that are most strongly affected, such as Italy. This indicates that the long-term dynamics of COVID19 spread might be intrinsically governed by a power law, even in the absence of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We interpret these findings with computer simulations of a metapopulation model, which can account for an initial exponential spread phase, followed by a longer-term power law behavior, by assuming that the infection spreads in a well-mixed manner inside local demes, while also spreading spatially across different demes. We relate model predictions to epidemiological correlations found in the data. These insights into the spread kinetics of COVID19 might be useful for assessing the impact of non-pharmaceutical intervention methods in different countries.",

The growth curve of confirmed cases was therefore shifted in time to make them comparable, according to the following procedure. The cumulative confirmed COVID19 case counts in Italy were chosen to be the example against which the growth curves in all other countries were compared, due to Italy being a current epicenter of the outbreak. The (normalized, cases per million) infection growth curves of the other locations were shifted in time such that the difference between all data points of the country under consideration and Italy was minimized. The shift that minimized this Euclidean distance between the curves was assumed to indicate the number of days that the country lags behind Italy. Some examples of such results are presented in figure 2 . We note that this assumes that all the countries test for COVID19 at comparable levels, which is an over-simplification.

For the power law function, a complication arose because fitting requires knowledge of the \"zero\" point, that is, the moment of time when the growth (according to the power law) began. The fits to the data change if the time scale is changed. Hence, we started by assuming the first data point to be the day when the infection frequency first exceeded 1 case per million, and fitted the power law, a 1 x b 1 , for some constants a 1 and Figure 2 : The same data as in figure 1 (bottom), presented by shifting individuals lines to match the Italy curve. The table shows the lag, that is, by how many days each country is behind Italy. b 1 . Then we shifted the time series incrementally by one day, and for each shift the power law was fitted. For each fitting frame, a different value of the power law exponent, b 1 , was obtained. Subsequently, we fit an exponential function to the same data (a 2 e b 2 x ). The estimated exponent does not depend on the time shift, so fitting the exponential function was straightforward and yields a unique value b 2 for all the fitting frames. For both the exponential and the power law fits, we determined the sum squared error between observed and expected, and compared them. For more details of the fitting procedure, see Appendix A. Figure 3 shows the fitting errors calculated for 75 countries; we included a country if the number of cases reached 20 per million, and excluded China and South Korea, since their epidemics clearly deviate from an exponential or a power law.

Mass-action dynamics are expected to yield exponential growth. As a result of non-pharmaceutical interventions that are only partially effective, people might stop traveling and thus slow down large scale mixing. However, they would still be interacting locally within their social network, which would lead to a transition to power law dynamics. It is possible that a number of countries are difficult to classify because they exhibit early mass action dynamics (exponential), followed by network interactions that lead to a transition to a power law.

The success of these intervention measures should be reflected in slowed infection spread. An understanding of the infection spread laws is crucial to interpret such data. If we assume that infection growth is exponential and if we plot the cumulative number of COVID19 cases on a log scale, a deviation and slow-down from exponential growth would lead to the conclusions that the non-pharmaceutical intervention measures are successful [16] . If, however, the true spread dynamics are characterized by a power law, we expect deviation and slow-down compared to exponential growth over time, even if the infection continues to spread at full force. In this case, a deviation from exponential spread cannot be interpreted to mean that non-pharmaceutical intervention measures are sufficient.

One of the larger challenges we faced in the data analysis is the lack of knowledge at what time the infection was initiated in the individual countries. This information is not available. The time frame in turn influences the fit of the power law to the data, which we have addressed with our time shifting methodology. If further information becomes available about the time when infections are estimated to have originated in the individual countries, the methodology can be updated. Genetic studies could provide valuable data in this respect.",

This is what we refer to as a \"fitting frame\". The fitting frame number one is when the first data point in the selected subset corresponds to day 1. The ith fitting frame shifts this point to day i. For each fitting frame, we obtained the best fit with function a 1 x b 1 , by using a built-in Mathematica routine \"FindFit\". Note that the natural logarithm of the data was fitted for the figures presented here. 1 Clearly, some fits are better than others, see figure 10(a,b) .

It is clear that, first of all, these fits are all parallel lines and thus the error is exactly the same (thus the exponential fitting errors as functions of the fitting frame are horizontal lines, see figures 3 and 4). Second, we note that these fits are not very good for Italy, that's why the power fit errors is always below the exponential error, see figure 4 (b). For comparison, panels (c) and (d) of figure 11 show the exponential fits for the US data. We can see that the quality of the fits is better, see also figure 4(b). In the main text and in this Appendix so far, we describe a fitting procedure where the \"confirmed cases\" data for each country were used only if the numbers exceeded 1 case per million. Here we demonstrate how this changes if a different choice is made and a minimum of 5 cases per million is required for each data point to be included. In figure 12 we demonstrate the difference for 30 countries. The choice of countries for this graphics was somewhat arbitrary: we included the 30 countries out of the subset used in figure 3 that had the largest infection (cases per million).",

The plots are presented on a log-log scale, such that the power law fits are straight lines. We can see that the best power law fit (blue) is a visibly better match than the exponential fit (yellow). Note that for all of these countries the power law fitting error for any frame shift is smaller than that obtained by the exponential fitting. The rest of the power law countries (those that were classified as power law like) are shown in figure 14 . This list contains 24 countries. For convenience, we present both a log log plot (such that the power law fits, blue, appear as straight lines) and a log plot (such that the exponential fits, yellow, appear as straight lines). Figure 15 shows the 9 countries that are characterized by a straight exponential growth. For these data, we used a log scale, such that the exponential fits are straight lines. For all of these countries the power law fitting error for any frame shift is larger than that obtained by the exponential fitting. Note however that power fits that are almost as good as exponential fits can always be found, if we we shift the frame far enough. These fits correspond to very large values of the power coefficient b 1 in the power law, see for example figure 4(a) which presents the example of the US. As the fitting frame index increases, the power law fitting error (top, blue line) approaches the exponential fitting error (horizontal yellow line). This, however, is meaningless, and does not indicate the presence of a power law.
