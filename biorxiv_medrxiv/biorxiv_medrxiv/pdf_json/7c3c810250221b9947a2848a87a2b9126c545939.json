NPIs are considered to be critical in order to at least delay the peak number of infected individuals and to prevent the health care system becoming overwhelmed by the number of patients to treat in hospitals or in intensive care units (ICUs). However, there is also increasing concern that the NPIs in place would increase mortality because of other diseases, increase the frequency of suicide and increase the risk of an economic recession with unforeseeable implications. It is therefore instrumental to evaluate the necessity of NPIs and to monitor the progress of containment of the virus spreading.",

Based on an extended infectionepidemic model, parameterized with data from the Robert Koch-Institute and, alternatively, with parameters stemming from a fit to the initial phase of CoV spreading in different regions of Italy, we consistently found that the reproduction number was turned down to a range near 1 in all federal states. We used the latest reproduction number as a starting point for the simulation of epidemic progression and varied the reproduction number, mimicking either release or strengthening of NPIs. Germany is currently, April 3rd, 2020, at the border line of a reproduction number between the scenarios of major immunisation of the population or eradication of the virus. We strongly recommend to keep all NPIs in place and suggest to even strengthen the measures in order to accelerate reaching the state of full control, thus, also limiting collateral damage of the NPIs in time. : medRxiv preprint 1 day, although the range varies between 0 -3 days (IQR) depending on age. The time span spent during hospitalization to admission in ICU is likely shorter as the patients get older.

            "text": "Outbreak of the novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (CoV) in China has induced a world-wide pandemic. The comparably high lethality in the elderly population and in patients with comorbidities (Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 2020), together with a widely absent immunisation of the population against the novel virus as well as the limited health system capacity, which was estimated to become overwhelmed by an unlimited virus spreading (an der Heiden and Buchholz 2020), led to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce virus transmission mostly by reducing inter-individual contacts. The aim of these measures was to achieve at least a delay of viral spreading, allowing the health care system to extend its capacities and to treat less patients per time. The measures might also induce a complete stop of viral spreading. The NPIs installed in Germany appeared to be efficient in containing viral dissemination. Any measure impacts on the observed numbers of new infections with a delay in the range of the serial interval, which is in the range of 4.5 days for CoV (Nishiura et al. 2020; Flaxman et al. 2020 ) and makes it difficult to judge when to release NPIs. In view of collateral damages and economic burden, the pressure to release NPIs as early as possible is increasing (Dorn et al. 2020 ). Thus, current political decisions require a safe ground providing an estimate of the impact of NPIs by now. In fact, a continuation of daily increase of reported cases while the measures are in place can also mislead political decisions if not well informed about the present trend of the achieved reproduction number. Furthermore, the high variance of the locally reported new cases adds to the uncertainty about the efficiency of the NPIs. Thus, it is extremely important to construct a model that captures not only the disease dynamics but also has the potential to inform us about the trend of the outbreak by considering the timedependence of the reproduction number for COVID-19. The situation in Europe was recently analysed (Flaxman et al. 2020 ). Here, a systematic analysis of the development of the reproduction number over the time period of the CoV-outbreak in Germany and in all federal states of Germany is provided by the date of paper submission.",

A too long application of NPIs carries the risk of collateral damage and imposes a strong economic burden (Dorn et al. 2020) . Given the currently achieved reproduction number in Germany and its federal states, a prospective development under the conditions of either keeping NPIs in place, releasing or strengthening them is needed to allow for a thorough and responsible decision. Here, these scenarios are provided in terms of the expected total fraction of the population infected and of the number of hospital beds and intensive care units (ICUs) needed to treat patients with severe disease progression.

            "text": "The basic reproduction number is a good measure for the long-term evolution of an epidemic that can be derived from such models (see Methods, Eq. (9)). However, it assumes constant conditions over the whole period analysed. In particular, the effect of NPIs on viral spreading enters the reproduction number only in a way mixed with the time before NPIs. For the evaluation of NPI effects on viral spreading, a time-varying reproduction number Rt has to be determined (Cori et al. 2013) . We opted for a shifting time window in each of which Rt is determined. We developed an automatized algorithm for the fast analysis of the current Rt (see Methods). Importantly, each time window is not analysed independently but includes the history of the epidemic by starting from the saved state of the simulation at the beginning of each time window. This analysis was developed for the sake of providing a daily updated evaluation of the reproduction number suitable to support political decisions on NPIs in the course of the CoV-outbreak and applied to German data ( Figure 2 ). Table 1 were used and the transmission rate R1 was varied (see Methods). (B) Time-varying reproduction number Rt as resulting from the fit in each time window in (A). The parameter sets were randomly sampled within the ranges in Table 1 and, upon refitting, this induced a variability of reported Rt values. The box plot shows the 25 and 75 percentiles as well as the min and the max values. Both used parameters sets (literature-based and derived from Italy-fit) are compared. (C-D) Same analysis for each federal state in Germany separately. Only the median value from an analysis as in (B) is reported for better visibility. The complete information can be found in the supplement. (E) The last reported Rt value in each federal state of Germany sorted by median values. Same box plot as in (B). The horizontal line shows Rt=1. (B-E): Each data point is a result of 100 randomly sampled parameter sets.

This leads to an overshoot of the Rt value in a strength depending on the size of the time window used for analysis. Later on, the nationwide NPIs imposed in Germany included the recommendation of self-isolation issued on March 6th, 2020, followed by encouraged social distancing by the chancellor Angela Merkel on March 12th, 2020. Then nationwide school closures on March 14th, 2020 and restrictions on public events followed on March 22nd, 2020. The timing of these NPIs suggests that they are responsible for the observed reduction of the reproductive number Rt. From there on, the reproduction number went continuously down to a value near 1 as of April 3rd. This illustrates that the NPIs imposed appear to have had a strong effect on the dynamics of the CoVepidemic.",

Most federal states hit early on by the CoV-outbreak now exhibit rather low reproduction numbers, with the exception of Bayern. Interestingly, the federal states in Eastern Germany and Saarland, where the first cases were reported late, are spread all over the ranking. The largest reproduction number was found in Saarland. It appears that a late onset of cases also has the tendency to delay the reduction of the reproduction number. Figure 2A , a value for the transmission rate R1 corresponding to Rt values multiplied with 5/3, 4/3, 1, 2/3, and 1/3 (colors) is assumed for each of the 100 simulations in Figure 2 We next investigated what the now achieved reproduction number of around 1 implies for the future. Starting from the last state of the model, thus, including the complex distribution of individuals onto the different compartments of the model at this time, the simulation was continued for one year with the very same latest reproduction number in Germany (Figure 3 , black box plots) and in three federal states (Figure 4 , black box plots). The analysis for the other federal states can be found in the supplement and at (SIMM-group 2020). Keeping all measures in place in Germany induces a long-term increase of the number of infected cases ( Figure 3A , black). This is associated with a needed peak capacity of 6,000 hospital beds for CoV-patients in 2 weeks from now and about the same number of ICU beds 2 weeks later ( Figure 3B , black). Note that the number of needed ICUs is similar to the total number of hospitalized patients because the time spent in ICUs upon complications is longer. According to the model results, the number of deaths due to CoV would reach an order of 10,000 within the next 4 weeks (supplement and SIMM-group 2020).",

With more restrictive NPIs in Saarland, viral spreading may be stopped within 3 months of time. Even if implemented today, the model predicts that the number of required ICUs will continue to rise for a few weeks before going down. More restrictive NPIs in Hamburg have the potential to lead to a fast stop of viral spreading on a scale of a few weeks up to two months. Hamburg can tolerate some reduction of NPIs and still control viral spreading, however, on a very long time scale (Figure 4 , Hamburg, magenta).

It can capture the qualitative aspects of how the number of new case incidences, patients admitted in hospitals and intensive care units as well as deaths alter as days progress during the CoV-outbreak. As parameterisation is essential for the quality of the predictions, two reference parameter sets were determined by thorough analysis of the literature on CoV and an independent analysis of Italian data. The results discussed are consistent between both parameter sets, which increases the credibility of the model results.",

If it is assumed that subsequent infections can occur at random during the infectious period before the onset of symptoms, then the average serial interval will be the sum of the average latent period (from infection to infectiousness) and half the average infectious period before disease onset. Hence, we can state the following equations: We know that the mean incubation period for COVID-19 is 5.2 days . The mean serial interval is estimated to be 4 days in one study from a total of 28 infector-infectee pairs (Nishiura et al. 2020 ) and 4.4 days in another study based on data from 21 infection chains in Hong Kong . For our calculation, we have used the mean of these two studies as our average serial interval, which is 4.2 days. Using the above equations for the serial interval and incubation period, we have calculated the values of 1/R2 and 1/R3, which provide us with a median value of 2 days for 1/R2 and 3.2 days for 1/R3. Further assuming that a person once exposed to the infection, spends at least one day in latent non-infectious period and overall, the latent noninfectious period (1/R2) is not greater than latent infectious period (1/R3), we get a range of 2.6 to 4.2 days for 1/R3. To calculate the corresponding value of 1/R2, we make use of the median incubation period (1/R2 + 1/R3) of 5.2 days.",

To estimate this, we have made use of one study with nine young patients with no underlying health conditions, where the excretion dynamics of reproductive viruses (Woelfel et al. 2020 ) from samples of the throat and sputum were examined. This study suggests active virus replication in the upper respiratory tract in the earlier phase of the disease following onset of symptoms. RT-PCR tests result in detectable viral sub-genomic messenger RNAs (sgRNA) in swabs from throat in the first 5 days after symptoms onset (In Figure 1 (d) of Woelfel et al. 2020 , the throat swab cultures are positive up to the 4 th day, which the authors mark as sample of 4/5 days). However, we note that active virus is found in the sputum until day 8 for these mildly ill cases. Accounting for some variations, we assume that patients with minor illnesses not requiring hospitalization are infectious for 6 days following disease onset, which results in a value of 6 days for 1/R4. For such individuals, to calculate the median value of R4, we neglect a potentially longer period of possible infections transmitted via the sputum, this mode of transmission being especially meaningful in a hospital setting. For our analysis, we have considered a range of 4 -14 days for 1/R4.",

We assume that this fraction increases with age. We vary \u03d1 within a range of 0.15 -0.40. \u03b1: Currently, there is no reliable data available about the asymptomatic cases. However, we note that about 9% of the confirmed infectious population in Italy remain asymptomatic (Italian data 2020). We can also have an idea about this fraction from the manifestation index (RKI Steckbrief 2020). The manifestation index describes the proportion of those infected who actually fall ill. Three studies from different settings (cruise ship outbreak, evacuated returning travellers, contact-based case search) gave figures of 51% (Mizumoto et al. 2020) , 69% (Nishiura et al. 2020b ) and 81% (Bi et al. 2020) . Hence, in a scenario where extensive tests are not performed and contacts are not traced properly, this fraction could be higher. However, in a setting where contacts have been traced properly, thereby effectively isolating the exposed population in an early stage before they become asymptomatic carriers, and when extensive tests are performed, this fraction would be minimal. As a median value, we assume it to be nearly 9%. We further assume that most of the people will show up symptoms as age increases. We vary \u03b1 for a range of values from 0.01 -0.16. \u03b2: It represents the risk of infection from the infected symptomatic patients as well as captures the risk from all those who are not yet effectively isolated. Therefore, this fraction varies within countries, cultures and healthcare systems. We assume it to be in the range of 0.05 -0.50. In the best-case scenario, this fraction would be zero, which is too unrealistic due to delay in isolating patients. The maximum value of this fraction is 1, which is also unrealistic as it would mean that even after symptoms occur, every patient is free to make contacts with others as before. As a median value, we assume \u03b2 to be 0.25.",
