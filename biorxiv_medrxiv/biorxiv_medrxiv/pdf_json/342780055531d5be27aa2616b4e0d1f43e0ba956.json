[1] [2] [3] [4] It has been used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and several other companies in their Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) assays. With many PCR-based molecular assays, an extraction step is routinely used as part of the protocol. This step can take up a significant amount of time and labor, especially if the extraction is performed manually. Long assay time, partly caused by slow sample preparation steps, has created a large backlog when testing patient samples suspected of COVID-19. Using flu and RSV clinical specimens, we have collected evidence that the RT-qPCR assay can be performed directly on patient sample material from a nasal swab immersed in virus transport medium (VTM) without an RNA extraction step. We have also used this approach to test for the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 reference materials spiked in VTM. Our data, while preliminary, suggest that using a few microliters of these untreated samples still can lead to sensitive test results.",

This plasmid is used as a positive control for the CDC's SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay. The positive control plasmid was mixed with VTM and 4 \u00b5L of this mix was used for the RT-qPCR reaction. The RT-qPCR results showed that the Ct values of control (without VTM) and VTM mixed reactions (all containing 400 copies/reaction) were very similar for all three (N1, N2 and N3) SARS-CoV-2 targets ( Table 3) . We also tested 40 copies of SARS-CoV-2 plasmid using RT-qPCR, which gave a Ct value of ~38 (data not shown). This means direct spiking of a higher concentration of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies in VTM did not have a major PCR inhibitory effect in the reactions when the target concentration is high ( Table   3) . Therefore, it is likely that specimens with higher viral load could also be detected by RT-qPCR without needing an RNA extraction step. SARS-CoV-2 plasmid in VTM did not show any PCR inhibition when compared to plasmid alone. The CDC positive control plasmid for SARS-CoV-2 (from IDT) was diluted in VTM or TE buffer (control) to get 100,000 copies per mL. 4 \u00b5L of SARS-CoV-2 plasmids in VTM and in TE buffer were added to a 20 \u00b5L PCR reaction mix targeting N1, N2 and N3 genes for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.

Though the theoretical copy number varied in each of the unprocessed samples(5, 10, 15  and 20 copies in 2, 4, 6 and 8 \u00b5L of input, respectively), all of them were detected. In this test, using 4 \u00b5L of the spiked sample displayed the lowest average (best) Ct. We speculate that in a 4 \u00b5L sample, the number of virus copies and PCR inhibitors in the reaction are balanced to offer maximum amplification efficiency.
