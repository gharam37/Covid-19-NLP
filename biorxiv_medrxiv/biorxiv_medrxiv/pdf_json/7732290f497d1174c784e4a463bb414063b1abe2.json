We first fit the constant transmission rate parameter to the epidemic data in Mayotte during an early exponential growth phase using an algorithm with a package R0 and based on the ML method. Thus, after the intervention and control measures imposed by the gouvernement, we introduce a simple temporally varying and exponentially decreasing transmission rate with a control parameter. This allows us to understand wheter these interventions are having the desired impact of controlling the epidemic by pointing out some percentages to maintain control which is critical in Mayotte given the fragility of its health infrastructure and the significant fraction of the population without access to water.",

Also in response to the rising numbers of cases and deaths, and to maintain the capacity of health systems to treat as many severe cases as possible, France like European countries and other continents, have implemented some process measures to control the epidemic including his overseas department outside the metropolitan France. The epidemic began slightly later in France, from February. To prevent further spread of Covid \u2212 19, all travel into Mayotte for tourism and family visits was prohibited from Friday, March 20. Only essential travel for selected individuals, such as residents returning home, professionals from essential services, and patients with health conditions was allowed to entry. Local authorities have advised all travelers arriving from the mainland France or areas affected by Covid \u2212 19 to self-isolate at home for 14 days and avoid contact with others. In addition, the government has urged the public to observe good personal hygiene, such as regular hand washing. Individuals who develop respiratory symptoms, such as cough, fever, and difficulty breathing, within 14 days of arrival into Mayotte are advised not to visit the doctor or emergency room directly, but to contact the SAMU (French Emergency Medical Services) immediately by dialing 15 . Further international spread of the virus was expected until March 29 ; but from March 30 the government has decided to cancel all flights both departure and arrival in Mayotte.",

Looking at case data, therefore, gives a systematically biased view of trends. However, in France and other contries in Europe the basic reproduction In our case, firstly we fit the constant transmission rate parameter of the model at the begining of the epidemic in Mayotte to observed data. After that we focused on the effects of the France government imposed public policies designed to contain this epidemic in his overseas department Mayotte from March 20, wich correspond to just a few days after that effective date of control measures which really started in practice.

The territory is also known as Maore, the native name of its main island, especially by advocates of its inclusion in the Union of the Comoros. Mayotte has a total land area of about 144 square miles or 374 square kilometres (sq. km), and with its almost 285000 people according to official estimates, is very densely populated at 747 inhabitants per sq.km. Mayotte is the poorest department of France. However, many immigrants from other Mozambique Channel nations enter Mayotte illegally, as it is one of the most prosperous regions in the area.",

Its status was changed to a departmental collectivity in 2001 and then to overseas department in 2011. Mayotte is represented in the French National Assembly by a deputy and in the French Senate by two senators. It is administered by a French-appointed prefect and an elected Departmental Council. The judiciary is modeled on the French system. Although, as a department, Mayotte is now an integral part of France, and despite being in France, the vast majority of Mayottes population do not speak French as a first language, but a majority of the people 14 years and older report in the census that they can speak French (with varying levels of fluency).

After that 8 others imported on March 26. Thus a total of 14 imported cases were confirmed. Three others imported cases were confirmed from march 27 to 29. One can thus think that almost 1 imported case is introduced per day. In this case and according to Remark 8, we can assume that among susceptibles individuals a negligible fraction of international infectious individuals subsequently travel and are detected in their destination to Mayotte. Thus, according to the model (8) one may take y(t) = t a variable number y(t) of exposed international travellers to Mayotte at time t. Clearly, this is reasonable according to the epidemic history data in Mayotte at the begining.

At equilibrium we do not mean that individuals are fixed within particular compartments, but rather the rate of individuals entering and leaving a compartment is excatly balanced.

To estimate the early dynamics of Covid \u2212 19 transmission in Mayotte, we fitted the value of the serial interval with a gamma distribution with mean 2 and standard deviation 0.5. By using the R 0 Package, we estimate that the basic reproduction number for the epidemic in Mayotte R0 = 2.44, with 95%C.IWe presented the code using the R 0 Package in the following lines.Now, we are able to apply the preceding compartmental model for the prediction of the Covid \u2212 19 in Mayotte.
