Predicting the surge in capacity has proved difficult due to the requirement of a subtle combination of diverse expertise and difficult choices to be made on selecting robust measures of critical care utilization, and parsimonious epidemic modelling which account for changing government measures. We modelled the required surge capacity of ICU beds in Italy exclusively for COVID-19 patients at epidemic peak. Because new measures were imposed by the Italian government, suspending nearly all non-essential sectors of the economy, we included the potential impacts of these new measures. The modelling considered those hospitalized and home isolated as quarantined, mimicking conditions on the ground. The percentage of patients in intensive care (out of the daily active confirmed cases) required for our calculations were chosen based on clinical relevance and robustness, and this number was consistently on average 9\u00b79% from February 24 to March 6, 2020. Five different scenarios were produced (two positive and three negative). Under most positive scenarios, in which R0 is reduced below 1 (i.e., 0 \u00b771), the number of daily active confirmed cases will peak at nearly 89 000 by the early days of April and the total number of intensive care beds exclusively dedicated to COVID-19 patients required in Italy estimated at 8791. Worst scenarios produce unmanageable numbers. Our results suggest that the decisive moment for Italy has come. Jointly reinforcement by the government of the measures approved so far, including home confinement, but even more important the full commitment of the civil society in respecting home confinement, social distancing and hygiene will be key in the next days. Yet, even under the best circumstances, intensive care capacity will need to get closer to 9000 units in the country to avoid preventable mortality. So far, only strong measures were effective in Italy, as shown by our modelling, and this may offer an opportunity to European countries to accelerate their interventions.",

While mathematical models and ground experience consistently show that strong government response measures did work in China to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV2 (4, 5) , there is now a pressing need for a coordinated upgrade of health systems in Europe to cope with this unprecedent crisis while government interventions come into place. The World Health Organization reports fast growing epidemic curves in Iran, Italy, Spain, France and Germany (1, 3) . The Achilles' heel of any health system is the limited capacity to deal with high patient inflows in a short period of time, and particularly patients that use scarce resources such as intensive care units (ICU) or mechanical ventilation (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) .",

Patients raise exponentially in numbers and a significant share of those patients will develop severe pneumonia (10), aggravated by concomitant disease and age (11, 12) . In addition, health workers are heavily exposed and they are overrepresented amongst the sick (13, 14) , which undermines the response capacity of the health system. The consolidated experience from China in responding to this crisis (5) and the lessons learnt from Italy in the early phase of the epidemic have the potential to provide important guidance to other nations. The two experiences provide a clear message that this epidemic can overwhelm health care capacities in a matter of days (5, 15, 16) . While the Italian government reacted quickly to early cases detected in Codogno by declaring the State of Emergency, followed by progressively restrictive measures (Box), the epidemic is not yet under control, with new cases ranging from 3 to 5 thousands per day in the last few days (17) .",

Moreover, that was the proportion of a sample of hospitalized confirmed patients and not of the confirmed active cases. The largest study from the Chinese CDC did not offer a better number, despite being a sample of confirmed cases, they provided a proportion of critical patients (4\u00b77%) certainly requiring intensive care, but a larger proportion of severe cases (13\u00b79%), which under certain conditions may also require an ICU bed (13) . Crucially, none of these numbers with one exception (15) consider the dynamic nature of the rate of use of ICU beds. In that study, the percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who were actively infected (15) .",

While we applaud these efforts to provide a range of policy options and their consequences on health and demand for critical care, such an undertake also includes large uncertainty in the numbers produced. The authors reported that certain policy options were robust to model uncertainty derived from potential variability in essential parameters such as the severity of the virus as captured by the proportion of cases requiring ICU admission or the basic reproduction number R0 (20) .

Additionally, we investigated by means of visual plots the national rate of daily increments in ICU patients by the daily increment in active confirmed cases, expressed as a percentage (Figure 2 A) . Figure 2 B shows early surging of ICU patients on the first days of the epidemic 24-25 February, and a second surge in ICU use peaking around 6 March. Additional regional analyses (not shown) confirmed that case surges in neighboring regions of Lombardy such as Piemonte and Liguria were contributors for the national rise in ICU cases 10 days later. From March 12, a steady decrease is noted and this is further accentuated after March 18 (Figure 2  B ). As previously reported (15) these rates were mostly within the range of 9% and 12% of active confirmed cases. Based on these observations, we delineated four relevant periods (table 1) . We based our choice of period to calculate the Daily ICU rate on three aspects. First, the two early periods up to 6 March are likely more representative of ICU admission criteria based on clinical realities. Secondly, a higher value will support a more conservative estimate of ICU bed requirement (9.9%). Third, high value consistency across these the first two periods. Subsequently we focused on the modelling strategy to forecast the expected number of active cases. Specifically, we decided not to model the spread of the disease by the conventional SIR (susceptible, infectious, recovered) model, since Italy was the first Western country to adopt immediate quarantine to contrast the diffusion of the virus. For this, we used a SIQR model ( figure 3) , where we consider a sub-population of quarantined individuals (Q). Details on the model and on the related mathematical framework can be found elsewhere (19) . The quarantined patients, once identified, are immediately isolated (either in hospital or at home), thus no longer transmitting the disease. It is worth noticing that we decided not to adopt a SEIR approach (susceptible, infectious, exposed and recovered), since it is well known that undetected asymptomatic individuals can transmit the disease (19) . The model was fitted with data on total confirmed active COVID-19 cases up to 19 March, and its predictive capability was checked with the available data up to 24 March. Results were found to be within the 50 % confidence band (indicating less than 50% variation in R0) in the subsequent 5-days period, indicating that the model works reasonably for planning resources on the mid-term ( figure 4 ). Longer-term predictions make little sense in a period when new drastic measurements are introduced almost daily (the latest was introduced on March 22). On the other hand, thanks to its intrinsic robustness, our model can be used to compare long-term scenarios, thus allowing to visualize projections on the potential effectiveness of the latest measures implemented.",

From the beginning of this emergency in Italy, the ICU bed capacity was identified as a major bottleneck and strong efforts, commensurate resources and attention have been dedicated to this direction from government, planners, media and academics. These efforts are ongoing. Italy has managed to increase its initial capacity of approximately 5200 ICU beds. Assuming that half of these beds can be exclusively used for COVID-19 patients, around 2600 ICU beds were available at baseline. As of 23 March, 3204 ICU beds were under use for these patients in Italy (17), neatly above baseline capacity under those assumptions. There is evidence that ICU capacity in Lombardy was approximately 720 beds pre crisis (16) while 1183 were used on 23 March (17) . The most difficult situation is described in Lombardy where critical care capacity has reached, according to regional government, its maximum capacity (24). There are better news in other regions which are currently increasing ICU capacity such as Veneto (n=325), Toscana (n=745), Campania (n=490) or Piemonte (n=160). Others did not report. These four Italian regions could be adding approximately 1720 new beds. This number is quite similar to numbers collected by the media, 1850 (25) . Currently, we estimate that the ICU capacity for this emergency is approximately 5000 beds. According to our data and estimates, under a positive scenario, this number should be increased by 76% progressively in the next two weeks if hospitals are to provide good quality of care (15) .",

Our rate of daily ICU use is obviously affected by conditions such as changes in case definitions, testing capacity, changes in clinical early detection, and changes in disease severity. We were conscious that case definition and testing strategies to optimize resource use were redirected before the end of February in Italy. Most severe patients probably arrived first to hospitals and a majority of them were of advanced age and with varying levels of comorbidities (11, 14) . Equally important, ICU admission criteria may have changed over the course of the emergency to deal with scarce ICU resources in particular locations, with difficult ethical choices to be made between providing ICU treatment versus palliative care in certain patients (26). To counteract these effects we chose a longer period to estimate our daily ICU rates and we corroborated the consistency of these values across days and periods defined. Additionally we chose the period at the beginning of the emergency where decisions were more likely made based on clinical realities and not on allocation of scarce resources. Our models, to a certain extent, depends on the quality of parametrization and its ability to predict future evolution of the epidemic. With this issue in mind, we tested its predictive ability on a six day window and we hope that this is enough to provide a range of good predictions from 25 March on and for at least 10 days, in a context where new drastic measures are introduced almost daily. We are aware that the numbers used in the model parametrization come with their own uncertainty, given that this disease is new, and context relevant data is not always available.",

While we modelled data at Italian level, regional level models would be a natural step to take, if not timely in Italy, at least for other countries in which autonomous regions and regions have to deal with the administration of health care resources.
