            "text": "In the current COVID-19 crisis, the US and many countries in the world are suffering acute shortages of modern ventilators to care for desperately ill patients. Since modern ICU ventilators are powerful devices that can deliver very high gas flow rates and pressures, multiple physicians have attempted to ventilate more than one patient on a single ventilatorso-called \"vent splitting\". Early applications of this approach have utilized simple concatenations of ventilator tubing and T-pieces, to provide flow to more than one patient. Additional approaches using custom flow splitters -sometimes made using 3D printing technologies -have also advanced into the clinic with FDA approval. However, heretofore there has been less progress made on controlling individual ventilatory pressures for patients with severe lung disease. Given the inherent variability and instability of lung compliance amongst patients with COVID-19, there remains an important need to provide a means of extending ventilator usefulness to more than one patient, but in a way that provides more tailored pressures that can be titrated over time. In this descriptive report, we provide the basis for a ventilator circuit that can support two patients with individualized peak inspiratory and end-expiratory pressures. The circuit is comprised of exclusively \"off the shelf\" materials and is inexpensive to produce. The circuit can be used with typical ICU ventilators, and with anesthesia ventilators used in operating rooms. Inspiratory and end-expiratory pressures for each patient can be titrated over time, without changes for one patient affecting the ventilation parameters of the other patient. Using in-line spirometry, individual tidal volumes can be measured for each patient. This Pressure-Regulated Ventilator Splitting (PReVentS) Yale University protocol operates under a pressure-control ventilatory mode, and may function optimally when patients are not triggering breaths from the ventilator. This method has been tested thus far only in the laboratory with mock lungs, and has not yet been deployed in animals or in patients. However, given the novelty and potential utility of this approach, we deemed it appropriate to provide this information to the broader critical care community at the present time. In coming days and weeks, we will continue to characterize and refine this approach, using large animal models and proof-of-principle human studies.",

            "text": "However, the approach to vent splitting that has been most widely discussed is ill-suited to the specific challenges of the current COVID-19 pandemic. In the Neyman/Babcock/Beitler approach, multiple patients are attached in parallel to the same ventilator without any intervening valves. Therefore, all patients experience the same airway pressures throughout the respiratory cycle, and ventilator settings cannot be changed for one patient without changing the settings for all others. This approach can be widely used during a mass trauma, where many patients will have healthy lung parenchyma with largely similar ventilation requirements and a straightforward clinical course. COVID-19 patients, on the other hand, can rapidly develop ARDS, and so ventilator requirements can change quickly and in unpredictable ways. Hence, patients who initially are well matched on a single ventilator may no longer be well matched as the day progresses. If the COVID-19 pandemic becomes as widespread as is now feared, affecting hundreds of thousands of US patients, the increase in ICU ventilator production may not be sufficient to keep up with patient demand. This could lead, in turn, to wrenching decisions about which patients should receive ICU ventilator support -heretofore an unthinkable prospect in the modern era.",

Gas from the ventilator would flow into the inspiratory limb of the circuit, where it would flow across two pressure-gated valves. For Patient #1, the inspiratory pressure-gated valve would be set at 5 cmH2O, resulting in a pressure drop across the valve of 5 cmH2O -therefore, Patient #1 receives a PIP of 35 cmH2O.

For Patient #2, the in-line expiratory PEEP valve would provide 5 cmH2O of PEEP. Since the ventilator is set with a PEEP of 0 cmH2O, the total PEEP experienced by each Patient is simply the value set for each in-line expiratory pressure-gated valve. However, if the PEEP on the ventilator were set at a number higher than zero -say, at 5 cmH2O -then the PEEP experienced by each patient would be the sum of the ventilator set PEEP and the setting of the pressure-gated valve on the expiratory limb of the patient's circuit.

With proper forethought, steps can also be taken to mitigate FiO2 drop during in-line suctioning (see below). \u2022 While not intrinsic to the PReVentS circuit, with the current hand-made valves it is necessary to briefly open the circuit to make valve adjustments.

It is therefore necessary to develop and implement a monitoring strategy that will reliably alert providers to unexpected changes and dangerous events. In the current crisis, not just ventilators but many types of medical devices are in short supply, which may affect the ability to provide monitoring. With that in mind, we propose a minimal monitor setup (that is absolutely required and will identify all the changes in patient condition we have so far considered) and a recommended monitor setup (which provides redundancy, could identify unconsidered situations, and would make patient management significantly easier and safer). The decision to proceed with only limited monitoring would necessarily depend upon the available alternatives and perceived balance of risk and benefit. This monitoring strategy is indebted to those already published by other groups considering ventilator splitting (Beitler 2020 , Pinson 2020 .",

This circumstance also would alter breath delivery dynamics to the other patients\" -Laboratory tests simulating cardiac arrest with chest compressions of one patient show retained ventilation of the other patient on the PReVentS circuit. Additionally, removal of one patient from the circuit can be accomplished in a straightforward manner without interruption of the other patient's ventilation.7. \"The added circuit volume defeats the operational self-test (the test fails). The clinicianwould be required to operate the ventilator without a successful test, adding to errors in the measurement\"-Individual in-line monitoring of volumes and pressures is the preferred approach when feasible. The self-test can be completed successfully using an equivalent length of respiratory tubing to the PReVentS circuit for appropriate measurement of circuit compliance.8. \"Additional external monitoring would be required. The ventilator monitors the average pressures and volumes\" -Additional monitoring is preferred, and feasible, with the PReVentS approach, including in-line monitoring of tidal volumes and pressures for each patient. Without individual tidal volume monitoring, the ventilator measures thecombined volumes for both patients, which can provide a sensitive and specific indication of changes in patient and circuit condition. 9. \"Even if all patients connected to a single ventilator have the same clinical features at initiation, they could deteriorate and recover at different rates, and distribution of gas to each patient would be unequal and unmonitored. The sickest patient would get the smallest tidal volume and the improving patient would get the largest tidal volume\" -Because the inspiratory and expiratory pressures of each patient are individualized and can be independently adjusted over time, changes in patient condition can be accommodated. 10. \"the greatest risks occur with the sudden deterioration of a single patient (e.g.",

The addition of the bias flow short circuit may also contribute to the shared VTe, but this can be minimized with a small and non-compliant bypass. This bypass volume can also be accounted for by clamping each patient one at a time and solving for the bypass circuit VTe algebraically. 2. Individual manometers near each patient Y-piece to monitor individual airway pressures -These measure peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) for each individual patient. Ideally, these manometers should provide information continuously and be alarmable (see below). At minimum, it is important to spot check airway pressures every time ventilator parameters are changed and whenever the Vte alarm identifies a change in system status. 3. End-tidal CO2 measurement -To ensure appropriate ventilation, patient CO2 should be monitored with arterial blood gas analysis, capnography, or a combination. This type of monitoring is typically standard for each ICU patient. 4. Standard ICU monitors (pulse oximetry, blood pressure, EKG, temperature).",

Continuous manometry at each patient Y-piece: This may be most easily done by attaching a standard invasive blood-pressure transducer to a connector placed near the patient Y-piece (Pinson 2020) . Airway pressures can then be displayed on a patient's vital signs monitor, appropriate alarms can be set to assure appropriate PIP and PEEP, and this information may even be remotely available at the nurses' station or elsewhere on the hospital floor. Note that pressures measured this way may be reported in mmHg rather than cmH2O, so conversion tables and provider training should be provided. 2. Independent tidal volume monitoring: This could be accomplished by a freestanding respiratory monitor with the flow sensor just distal to the patient Ypiece (Beitler 2020) .However, these appear to be a relatively limited resource. We are actively in the process seeing whether outpatient pneumotachometers can be adapted to this purpose. Another alternative is that some ICU ventilators allow for attachment of an external flow sensor (for instance, Carefusion markets the VarFlex sensor) which could be used to measure a single patient's VTe, and the other patient's could be approximated by subtracting the first patient's VTe from the combined VTe from the shared ventilator. 3. Continuous capnography of each patient: could identify accidental hypo-or hyperventilation in real time and alert the provider.",
