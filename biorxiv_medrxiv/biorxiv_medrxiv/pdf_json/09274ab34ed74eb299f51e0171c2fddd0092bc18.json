So far, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 2,000,000 people and led to nearly 135,000 deaths worldwide. The COVID-19 outbreak has been declared a pandemic and is expected to cause one of the most serious global public health problems in recent years. 1 Of note, the impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic are not only limited to global public health but also affect the global economy, geopolitics, culture, and society. Thus, an accurate prediction of the epidemic trend of COVID-19 may provide valuable advice on how to effectively control its spread and relieve its major social and economic impacts. Although a number of studies have estimated the epidemic trend of the COVID-19 outbreak, most have used early-stage data and focused on cases in China. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] For example, using the SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed) model, Wang In this study, based on the public data of COVID-19 cases, we predicted its epidemic trend in China and across the world. We first built a prediction model using the publicly available data for COVID cases. These data include daily numbers of cumulative confirmed cases (CCCs), new cases (NCs), and death cases (DCs) of COVID-19 in China since January 20, 2020. We trained our model using data from January 20, 2020, to March 1, 2020, and predicted the daily numbers of CCCs, NCs, and DCs. Furthermore, we predicted the epidemic trend of COVID-19 across the world (outside China) using models derived from those built based on Chinese cases.",

Due to insufficient sample sizes of the datasets for COVID-19 cases across the world (outside China) because of the recentness of the outbreak, we did not directly use Eureqa to build predictive models for the COVID-19 epidemic trend across the world. We instead derived them from the models for Chinese cases on the assumption that the COVID-19 epidemic trend outside China was similar to that in China with a time lag.",

Although this disease appears to be well controlled in China, the recent dramatic increase in new cases and deaths outside China indicates that the outbreak may have catastrophic results globally without implementation of the necessary mitigation measures. However, the experience of China suggests that the outbreak is controllable if effective strategies are employed. 8 Because the COVID-19 outbreak outside China is in the initial or exponential expansion phase, depending on the region or country, it is currently difficult to predict the major turning points in the COVID-19 epidemic outside China based on their data. Therefore, we assumed that the COVID-19 outbreak outside China follows a similar pattern to that in China, and accordingly derived predictive models for the epidemic outside China from models built based on Chinese cases. Our models predicted that the COVID-19 outbreak would peak across the world around May 22, 2020, and would be basically under control around February 21, 2020 (Fig. 4A) . It should be noted that these predictions were made under the premise that countries outside China implement comprehensive and stringent control measures as in China, such as city lockdowns, traffic control, and concentrated medical support for seriously infected areas.

The model R 2 was 0.998 on the training set. The model predicted around 4,000 deaths caused by COVID-19 during the epidemic in China(Fig. 1C). Furthermore, we estimated that the mortality rate for COVID-19 would be 4.2%, which is slightly higher than the mortality rate of 4.1% calculated based on the latest data on April 16, 2020. However, because the number of NCs was growing small, while the number of critical cases remained at more than 95 on April 16, 2020, the final actual mortality rate for COVID-19 in China will approach to our estimate.
