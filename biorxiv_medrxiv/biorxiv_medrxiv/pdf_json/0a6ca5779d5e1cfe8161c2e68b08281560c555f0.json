            "text": "During a burgeoning outbreak of a novel disease, public attention will ordinarily expand as the severity of the outbreak expands-as infections multiply and news reports accumulate. Such public attention will in turn reinforce tactics to control the outbreak. In classical epidemiological models, effects of such tactics can be incorporated in standard parameters of transmission, recovery, and mortality. Unfortunately, early in an outbreak those individual parameters may be poorly known, hence corresponding models can get lost in uncertainty. This makes it difficult to determine whether the disease is spreading exponentially or logistically, or along another path. Examining cases over time is also problematic, as a logistically growing infection that is leveling off appears exponential in early phases. Here we report on the most basic mechanistic, ecological model we can imagine, which can help distinguish growth that is and is not under control. This approach did a satisfactory job predicting the final outcome of the Ebola outbreak of 2014-15. The model's two parameters were computable in real time, well before the outcome was actually known. The first parameter is an intrinsic rate of increase in cumulative deaths or reported cases. The second parameter is related to the human social system and represents all tactics that combine to control the outbreak. That parameter is coupled to the number of cumulative deaths or cases. We examine the basic mechanisms operating in this model and show the predictions made during the Ebola outbreak. We also consider how this basic model is performing for the Covid-19 pandemic and highlight ecological models that align with popularly discussed concepts such as flatten-the-curve, exponential growth, and inflection points of curves.",

I. Introduction I n September 2014, some Ebola modelers were allowing for worst-case scenarios, partly by projecting continuing exponential growth [18] , and later received discouraging coverage for overestimating the outbreak [6] . The number of cases of Covid-19 are often considered exponential as well, and this has major repercussions, for example, in communication to the public, projecting morbidity and mortality, and evaluating effectiveness of control measures. However, the early phase of logistic growth also appears exponential. How can the two be distinguished?",

Although there is an early phase of logistic growth that appears \"exponential-like\" (and some populations may actually grow exponentially or super-exponentially at times) the growth of an epidemic is likely logistic throughout. The basic method presented here revealed that the spread of Ebola in 2014-15 was logistic from early in the outbreak. That is, the rate of deaths were declining relative to new deaths from the beginning, undoubtedly due to ever-increasing efforts at control. From early in the outbreak, the method projected final deaths in the epicenter of western Africa to be the order of 10,000 ( Figure 1C ), which is close to how the outbreak developed.",

To accomplish the second point, a mechanistic model must have dynamical variables and parameters that can be measured. If it is overly mechanistic-if it contains elements that cannot be readily determined early in the outbreak of a novel disease-it may help understand the conceptual dynamics of a system, but cannot be used for projections of the system into the future. Even basic epidemiological models, such as the common SIR model (Appendix I), are overly mechanistic in that way. Of course, for a conceptual understanding of disease transmission, this representation is used because new infections in susceptible individuals are caused by individuals previously infected, so the development of the disease depends on both of those numbers. However, without medical tests able to detect infections, the number infected will not be known, hence the transmission parameters such as rates of infection, recovery, and death will not be known. Thus it can be difficult or impossible to accurately project the course of the outbreak using a classical model with multiple unknown parameters [9] . In addition, early in the epidemic, individual variation in transmission and behavior may have outsized effects, making them even more difficult to parameterize. Therefore, simpler views are needed.",

Microscale models can handle genetic variation within groups, variation in infectivity among individuals, such as super-spreaders in disease, and other finer details.

But deaths occurred in a fraction of those infected and could be tracked as a more definitive measure. When properly rescaled, the cumulative number of deaths can be a proxy in particular models for the primary dynamical variable, the number of infections (Appendix I). Moreover, in a dread disease like Ebola, the cumulative number of deaths affects society's view of the seriousness of the outbreak, and hence the number of deaths feeds back into efforts to control the disease. Cumulative deaths thus becomes a primary dynamical variable in its own right, and secondarily a proxy for the number of infections at a fixed average time in the past.",

Early in the course of a rapidly spreading outbreak of infectious disease, the fraction of the population infected is low, which simplifies the dynamics and reduces the number of parameters needed to estimate the ultimate size and duration of the outbreak, and thereby help determine the level of human effort needed to control it. In such situations the standard SIR model can be greatly reduced to a related but rather different \"rsN\" model, which is amenable to modeling and data fitting, even early in the course of an outbreak, because its parameters can be known. It is the simplest form of a density-dependent ecological model, motivated by a general model for growth of an ecological population as a function of its density (Equation 1 of Figure 2 , [12] ). Truncating on the right of the equal sign to terms of first order creates the two-parameter rsN model (Equation 2 of Figure 2 ).

The red dots were used to generate the projections, the gray dots to judge accuracy. Solid curves show various projections. (A) Deaths were accelerating when we started tracking the outbreak as part of a classroom exercise, though at a decelerating relative rate. The blue curve is the best-fit projection based on doubling times among the red dots-in other words, estimating the exponential growth. The green curve is the best fit for logistic growth. The blue and green curves seem quite similar, but they have dramatically different outcomes rather quickly. (B) The same data shown as percentage change in deaths versus total deaths. The red dots from early in the epidemic reveal a downward slant. The green line is a regression line that follows this trend, whereas the blue line is the mean through the red points. Using the mean generates exponential growth, and using the slope generates logistic growth. Despite much noise in the early data, the green regression line successfully projected the outcome. Looking at the data points, a downward blip began between four and five thousand deaths, and then an upward super-exponential blip arose, followed by another downward and smaller upward blip before settling down (traced in orange as a curve smoothed from the data). Curiously, this roughly matches the theoretical pattern illustrated in Appendix II. (C) Early projections and the actual course of the outbreak. Blue is an exponential projection from the red dots at the beginning of the outbreak, corresponding roughly to other early estimates of an emerging pandemic.

However, a cumulative Gaussian curve is essentially indistinguishable numerically from a properly parameterized logistic curve [3] , and therefore what Farr did, and what has been done subsequently, can be considered to be fitting the r and s parameters of a mechanistic ecological model, using Gaussian curves as surrogates.

We found theoretically that including discrete regions or countries can result in temporary periods of orthologistic growth moderated by subsequent periods of logistic growth (Appendix II). To model that calls for a metapopulation model [16] , or possibly a spatially explicit model with a fat-tailed distribution for dispersal, but there would not be enough information to parameterize such a model at the beginning of the spread, and indeed some of the important dispersal events are intrinsically stochastic. But as shown in Appendix II, a disease spreading sub-exponentially within each region, and spreading sub-exponentially from region to region, can leave a signature of periodic super-exponential growth across all regions, even as the disease is moderating in all regions.

Instead, in this representation the epidemic growth has been logistic all along, so the approximate location of the inflection point can be estimated early on, assuming consistent conditions. There are two steps to calculating the theoretical peak population growth rate, \u2206N/\u2206t, or the inflection point of the logistic curve. Find the carrying capacity, K, where the regression line in the 1/N \u2206N/\u2206t versus N graph crosses the horizontal axis. This can also be calculated as \u2212r/s. Next divide that value for K in half, \u2212(r/s)/2. Panels (C) and (D) of Figure 8 depict population growth rate, \u2206N/\u2206t, versus time in days. This is the number of reported deaths per day over time. The familiar phrase \"flattening the curve\" applies to this graph. The blue line is analogous to the blue lines in the other panels of Figure 8 ; it is the time where \u2206N/\u2206t is theoretically at a maximum. After the time indicated by the blue line, if the r and s are accurate, the daily number of deaths will decrease.",

With more and more parameters in a model, statistical variance in estimates of the parameters can add up to overwhelm the model. This is related to the statistical property that the variance of a sum is the sum of all the individual variances. C. Sampling errors.

For any specific case, it is possible to use statistical partitioning into multiple simulations to see how subdivisions of the model, for example into smaller and smaller geographic regions, might introduce errors in more complex models that are not inherent in simpler ones. Finally, the projections of the number of US deaths from Covid-19 we present here are considerably smaller than some other estimates that have been projected. However, that must not be taken as a reason to relax efforts to subdue the spread. On the contrary, it is evidence that the expanding measures are working, and they are visible as a negative s term in the model. Relaxing the measures as deaths increase, or as time passes, before the disease is subdued, will change the value of the s term and increase the projections offered here. The cumulative number of deaths can approach a limit, \u2212r/s, when measures continue to expand. If measures don't continue in this way, these projections from real data will not hold. Continuing future applications of this model using deaths can reflect, with some delay, when measures represented by s are not keeping pace with what is needed.",

Suppose also that most of a large population is susceptible, so that the term S/(S+I+R) is essentially 1. Further suppose that the disease spreads rapidly relative to ordinary population processes such as births, so that population changes embedded in functions g i (t) will be negligible. In that case the SIR model reduces to an I model that is approximately dependent only on the infectivity \u03b2, the recovery rate \u03b3, and the death rate \u03b1. This reduced equation has an explicit solution I(t), which appears to the right of the arrow. The multiplicative constant of integration is unity because the number of infections at t = 0 is 1. ",

Adjusting \u03b3 upward also represents better care, helping those infected recover more quickly. It can also represent antibiotics that can cure individual already infected. However, vaccination is not provided for in SIR Equation 1. That would be handled by an additional term \u2212\u03baS in dS/dt and +\u03baS in dR/dt, directly connecting the susceptible S category to the R category-R then meaning resistant rather than recovered.",

Later the three now-infected regions each seed one uninfected region on average, now making six total infected regions. Later still the six now-infected regions each seed less than one new region each. Thus the spread between regions is slowing, from 2 new regions for each infected region to 1 new region to about 0.8, and the rate of spread within each region is also continually moderating following logistic dynamics. Nonetheless, across all regions combined, the disease can grow faster than exponentially at times, as it is subsiding ( Figure 10 ). Figure 10 : Local growth and regional spread graphically. (A) From the right-most column of 11, representing all regions combined, the expansion appears to be exponential. It is not, even though an exponential curve through the data fits with R 2 > 0.99, (B) The same data graphed as a per capita growth rate, revealing the curve in Part A as sub-exponential, though with a signature of repeated blips of super-exponential and subexponential growth.
