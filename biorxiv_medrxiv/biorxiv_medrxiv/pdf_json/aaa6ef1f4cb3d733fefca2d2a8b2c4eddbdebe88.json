According to dynamical model and cluster analysis, we category the globe into four type regional epicenters of the outbreak: Southeast Asia extending southward to Oceania, the Middle East, Western Europe and North America. Among them, Western Europe will become the major center of the outbreak. The peak values in Germany, Italy and Spain are estimated to be 105,903, 127,283 and 152,539, respectively. The United States is the country with the most serious outbreak trend. Based on the current control measures by Mar. 27, 2020, the peak value in the United States will reach 400,892. Above all, if the current control measures are maintained, the cumulative number of patients worldwide will be 1, 442,523 (95% CI: 1,052,981,440). We also estimated the diagnosis rate, recovery rate and infection degree of each country or region, and use clustering algorithm to retrieve countries or regions with similar epidemic characteristics. Different suggestions are proposed for countries or regions in different clusters.",

The disease spread across China during the traditional Chinese Spring Festival. As of 24:00 on March 14, China had passed the peak of the epidemic and started to recover gradually, with a total of 80,844 confirmed cases reported [3] . However, new cases of disease began to appear in other parts of the world and increases rapidly. Because of the rapid spread of the disease, the World Heath Organization (WHO) has assessed COVID-19 as a pandemic [4] , which is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. As of March 14, 2020 , the cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 135 countries and regions worldwide, with a total of 142,539 confirmed cases (61,518 outside of China) and 5,393 deaths (2, 199 outside of China) [5] . Among them, a total of 17,660 cases were confirmed in Italy, 11,364 in Iran, 8, 086 in Republic of Korea, 1,678 in The United States, furthermore, Europe became the epicenter of the pandemic, with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China [6] .",
