            "text": "As the number of cases of COVID-19 continues to grow exponentially, local health services are likely to be overwhelmed with patients requiring intensive care. We develop and implement an algorithm to provide optimal re-routing strategies to either transfer patients requiring Intensive Care Units (ICU) or ventilators, constrained by feasibility of transfer. We validate our approach with realistic data extracted from UK and Spain. For the UK case, we coarse-grain the NHS system at the level of NHS trusts and, subsequently cover the whole set of geopositioned trusts to extract a 4-regular geometric graph which indicates, for a given trust, its four nearest neighbors. The Spanish case is analysed at the autonomous community level, and we extract a contact network where nodes correspond to autonomous communities and links indicate adjacent communities. Estimates of weekly ICU demand could be extrapolated from an age structured epidemiological model by considering contagion-to-ICU likelihood estimates or alternatively from available data. Through random search optimisation we identify the best load sharing strategy, where the cost function to minimise is based on the total number of ICU units above capacity and we implement and test two optimisation strategies. Our framework is flexible allowing for additional criteria, different cost functions, and this methodology is general enough that it can easily be extended to optimise other resources beyond ICU units or ventilators. Assuming a uniform ICU demand across trusts, we show that using our method it is possible to enable access to ICU treatment to up to 1000 cases in the UK in a single step of the algorithm, and with more realistic demand the algorithm is able to balance about 600 beds per step in the Spanish system -leading to potentially saving a large percentage of these lives that would otherwise not have access to ICU if no load sharing was implemented.",

            "text": "The coronavirus disease COVID-19 [1], whose outbreak was detected in China in December 2019 [2] , has become pandemic and as of March 2020 is putting national health systems of different countries into significant levels of stress [3] [4] [5] [6] (see [7] and references therein for a fully detailed thread of reports including the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions in a number of countries, severity analysis, symptom progression, etc, elaborated by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team). It is expected that the ICU demand of several hospitals across the UK will surpass their nominal capacity, as is already happening in Spain [8] . The shortage of sanitary resources is unlikely to be limited to ICU units or ventilators, and other resources will face similar challenges. In anticipation of these scenarios, here we design and implement a simple and flexible load sharing procedure which we hope can help to alleviate the level of stress of healthcare systems and implement and test with information for the UK National Health Service (NHS) and the Spanish health system. Graph-embedded load balancing [9, 10] has been mainly explored in computer science, usually taking a 'vertex perspective' for graphical computation with the aim of achieving a centralised solution to load allocation, subject to locality and availability constraints [11] . Interestingly, this line usually relates to minimise large-scale computational efforts, rather than actually sharing physical resources. A similar approach overlaps with the so-called Social Choice Theory of allocating goods among a set of agents under some constraints that overlaps economics, social sciences and computer science [12] [13] [14] [15] . Here we build on conceptually similar approaches although we focus on a healthcare network where resources to be shared consist on ICU beds or ventilators, within the context of COVID-19 pandemic. As a proof of concept, we apply our framework to two realistic cases of different spatial resolution: the United Kingdom's full NHS trust network, and the Spanish contact network between autonomous communities. We focus on the problem of ICU demand and propose and implement a routine strategy to transfer resources across the network, which we subsequently show to provide useful and relevant outcomes.",

Accordingly, the global_stress of the whole system and the net reduction in the number of ICU beds in excess (in collapsed trusts) is also computed. Figure 3 : Response of the UK healthcare system (in terms of global_stress and net reduction in number of ICU beds) after the load sharing procedure is applied, as a function of the initial demand per trust (uniform demand across trusts). Different lines correspond to different modes: absence of load sharing (red); single-share, parallel mode (green); single-share, sequential mode (blue); multiple-share, sequential mode (black). Results are similar across modes. We can see three regimes: an initial regime where the load sharing procedure easily removes all signs of overwhelming, a second regime where although the procedure cannot remove all signs of overwhelming, the net reduction is maximised, and a third regime where the load sharing procedure is less and less efficient due to the fact that the whole system is overwhelmed.",

As expected, the curves increase when the demand per trust is uniformly increased. At the beginning (for a uniform demand between 0 and 20 ICU beds per trust), the load sharing procedure works very well and completely removes any sign of overwhelming of the system (i.e. keeping the global_stress around zero). When the demand per trust increases further we enter in a second regime (between 20 and 40 ICU beds per trust) where the system shows serious signs of overwhelming but the load sharing procedure removes a large portion of it. If the demand per trust increases above 40 ICU beds, the whole system is vastly overwhelmed, and the load sharing procedure becomes less and less efficient and the resulting net reduction decreases. Results are systematically better for the parallel mode than the sequential mode, but as previously mentioned, this comes at the expense of inevitably overwhelming some receptor trusts.

This result is easy to interpret: there is not an enormous gain in being able to share loads to different receptors (vs one receptor), because on average this possibility will only be useful in a handful of cases. In other words, this result is a byproduct of artificially imposing a uniform-load. Something different is expected to happen if the initial demand on each node is not uniform. Suppose, for instance, that we have a few trusts that are extremely overwhelmed, and could in principle share loads with several receptors (more than one available receptor in its topological neighborhood), but suppose that those receptors are small trusts with only a small number of available ICU beds. In that case, a single-share approach is clearly deficient, but a multiple-share approach could indeed provide a notable improvement. We illustrate this case in the following section.",

All data and codes, as well as further versions, are and will be available at https://github.com/lucaslacasa/loadsharing . We have presented a proof of concept algorithm and implementation and showed that this procedure works well and can de-collapse the national health systems in UK and Spain in a range of scenarios. The random search optimisation layer allows to explore non-intuitive load sharing configurations which go beyond the trivial solution to share load with the neighbor with highest capacity, a strategy which might be locally optimal but also might be leading to a global response far away from the global optimum. We have depicted and studied several options, such as sequential vs parallel update mode, and compared results of single-share (where a trust can only share load with a single receptor) or multiple-share (where the trust can share parts of the load with different receptors of its neighborhood).",

This is likely to be the case (i) at the beginning of the exponential growth phase, (ii) in situations with full lockdown where the demand is on decline and only some trusts are overwhelmed, or in general (iii) when the epidemic curve is on decline and not all trusts are overwhelmed. On the other hand, when the system is already fully overwhelmed or soon-to-be, this strategy is likely to be inefficient.",

            "text": "From a clinical point of view, an important point to consider is whether the load sharing can be activated at the ICU stage -potentially leading to transferring highly unstable patients who require ambulance with ICU equipment as well as trained personnel -or if, in anticipation to this, transfer needs to be planned at the point of hospitalisation (admission). In the latter scenario, planning needs to further take into account not only baseline ICU capacity, but overall capacity, also factoring in the estimated lag between admission to hospital and necessity of ventilator, which for COVID-19 is currently estimated at about 2 to 3 days. In a similar vein, note that this work explicitly considers the transfer of ICU patients, however exactly the same approach can be followed if the load to be shared is not patients but ventilators (the units to be shared are not ICU patients but ventilators, so transfer simply happens in the opposite direction, from receptor to origin). Assuming the receptor has both room and personnel to handle additional ventilators, this alternative would indeed eliminate the burden on transferring highly unstable patients and the associated resources required to make such transfers.",

            "text": "This work is of course subject to several limitations which we hope will be addressed in future iterations. First of all, the baseline ICU demand only takes into account surge capacity in the Spanish case: more realistic analysis of the UK case shall include surge capacity, that is expected to significantly increase the real ICU capacity of each trust. Second, in the sequential mode (where receptors cannot be overwhelmed by construction) load sharing is conducted in a sequential way but there is no optimisation in this part, mainly because by definition overwhelmed nodes can at most share all the excess load, not more (and therefore combined load shares are not explored). Also, the optimisation process implemented here is based on a stochastic search and as such there is no guarantee that the suggested configuration is the global optimum. Other refined methods such as hill climbing, genetic algorithms or simulated annealing can be used. Finally, we have assumed that the number of ambulances or the human resources are not a constraint, and that there are enough vehicles to transfer ICU patients or ventilators effectively and enough qualified personnel to handle them. All these limitations can easily be addressed by suitably extending the specifications of the algorithm.",
