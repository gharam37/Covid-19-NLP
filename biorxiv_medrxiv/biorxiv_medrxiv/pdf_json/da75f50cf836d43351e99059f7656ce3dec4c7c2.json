From Jan 22nd to Mar 1st,all suspected pediatric patients were admitted to the national clinical center of infectious diseases of the third People's Hospital of Shenzhen,and relevant examinations were completed as routine precedures, and clinical and laboratory data of the first day after admission were collected. Based on laboratory pathogen identification results including 2019-nCoV,INF A,INF B,RSV,MP, and bacteria,all cases were divided into the 2019-nCoV confirmed group and the non-2019-nCoV group, and the differences between the two groups were compared. Inclusion criteria: all suspected pediatric cases. Exclusion criteria:(a) pathogen identified as bacteria or MP; (b) coinfection; were conducted by using of IBM Statistical Product and Service Solutions software Version 24 (SPSS Inc,Chicago,IL).Continuous variables were summarized as the median with their IQRs or mean with SDs, median [IQR] or [mean \u00b1SD], depending on whether their distributions were normal or not.Comparisons of categorical variables were performed using the Pearson Chi square test.The parametric tests (independent sample Student t-test) or non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U test) were used to analyse variables.

The clinical picture of these different pneumonias can be very similar, but viral infection is more common in the pediatric populations.Despite great advances in virus detection and pneumonia imaging, 4-5 the identification and differential diagnosis of viral infections has been facing enormous challenges because laboratory detections and radiographic images are not always in agreement with clinical features and contact histories of patients. 15-17 RT-PCR methods based on spike gene and N gene were widely used for detecting viral RNA,and were considered a gold standard. 18-19 However, this method had its limitations, such as false positive or false negative results,time consuming,false sampling,inconsistence of sample collections and preparations. Most importantly, the inaccuracy of RT-PCR method caused problems in timely triage,isolating the source of infection,the following reasonable treatment, early removal of isolation, and improvement of psychological stress in children.",

            "text": "-24 Among these traditional biomarkers,hs-CRP and PCT have shown superior value in distinguishing bacterial and viral infections as well as bacterial coinfections. PCT appears to be most effective in selecting bacterial cases and assessing severity. However, the precise cut-offs between the separation of bacteria from viruses and the separation between mild and severe separations have not been established. 25 In adults, most patients with CAP and a PCT concentrations <0.5 ng/mL do not require antibiotic treatment because the disease may be viral and can be resolved spontaneously. Data regarding children, despite being limited, are consistent with those collected in adults. Li Z et al found that serum PCT level could provide a useful method of distinguishing bacterial coinfections from an H1N1 influenza infection alone in children during the early disease phase. 26 Chen ZM et al also suggested using a PCT>0.5 ng/mL to identify 2019-nCoV with bacterial coinfections. 10 However, the role of PCT in identifying between viruses and viruses or viral coinfection in children remain unknown. Our investigation also used the criterion of PCT>0.5 ng/mL to exclude bacterial infection or coinfection. Three cases in the non-2019-nCoV group considered bacterial infections, and one case in the 2019-nCoV confirmed group had IFN A coinfection, but the possibility of combined bacterial coinfection cannot be ruled out. Interestingly, the PCT of the other three cases with RSV coinfection in the 2019-nCoV confirmed group was still significantly higher than that of 2019-nCoV infection alone.Limited to laboratory testing methods and personnel during the epidemic, except for 2019-nCoV, our hospital can only perform RT-PCR detection of IFN A, B, RSV and cytomegalovirus. Unidentified nonbacterial infections may be other types of viral infections. It also does not rule out that some 2019-nCoV All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
