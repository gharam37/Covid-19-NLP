            "text": "We describe a method for rapid in silico selection of diagnostic peptides from newly described viral pathogens and applied this approach to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. This approach is multi-tiered, beginning with compiling the theoretical protein sequences from genomic derived data. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 we begin with 496 peptides that would be produced by proteolytic digestion of the viral proteins. To eliminate peptides that would cause cross-reactivity and false positives we remove peptides from consideration that have sequence homology or similar chemical characteristics using a progressively larger database of background peptides. Using this pipeline, we can remove 47 peptides from consideration as diagnostic due to the presence of peptides derived from the human proteome. To address the complexity of the human microbiome, we describe a method to create a database of all proteins of relevant abundance in the saliva microbiome. By utilizing a protein-based approach to the microbiome we can more accurately identify peptides that will be problematic in COVID-19 studies which removes 12 peptides from consideration. To identify diagnostic peptides, another 7 peptides are flagged for removal following comparison to the proteome backgrounds of viral and bacterial pathogens of similar clinical presentation. By aligning the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 field isolates deposited to date we can identify peptides for removal due to their presence in highly variable regions that may lead to false negatives as the pathogen evolves. We provide maps of these regions and highlight 3 peptides that should be avoided as potential diagnostic or vaccine targets. Finally, we leverage publicly deposited proteomics data from human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, as well as a second study with the closely related MERS-CoV to identify the two proteins of highest abundance in human infections. The resulting final list contains the 24 peptides most unique and diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These peptides represent the best targets for the development of antibodies are clinical diagnostics. To demonstrate one application of this we model peptide fragmentation using a deep learning tool to rapidly generate targeted LCMS assays and data processing method for detecting CoVID-19 infected patient samples.",

            "text": "The identification of peptides expressed unique to pathogens is required for the development of diagnostic assays as well as vaccine targets. Antibody based techniques such as enzyme linked immunosorbent assay rely on antibodies raised against specific peptide targets. Mass spectrometry (MS) based diagnostic assays typically require many rounds of optimization to identify peptides that are unique in both sequence or in chemical characteristics to distinguish them from the complex host background. 1 The detection of viral proteins in body fluids can be a rapid and specific diagnostic for infection in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). [2] [3] [4] During the 2003 (SARS) outbreak, non-MS based methods of protein detection proved to be more successful 5,6 than LCMS methods. [7] [8] [9] Non-MS based methods, such as western blots, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and protein arrays, rely on antibodies for the detection of proteins. Given recent studies concerning high variability in antibody production, LCMS-based methods are an attractive alternative approach for the rapid identification of small molecules, proteins, and peptides in clinical settings where consistency is paramount. 10, 11 In the 15 years since the 2003 SARS outbreak, LCMS technology has experienced a revolution led primarily by increases in the speed, sensitivity, and resolution of MS instruments. Today, protein array and antibody-based methods are falling out of favor in both research and clinical diagnostics, due in large part to the improvements in LCMS technology. 12, 13 A review of this growth by Grebe and Singh described a clinical lab with no LCMS systems in 1998 that completed over 2 million individual LCMS clinical assays in 2010. 14 Incremental improvements in rapid sample preparation techniques, chromatography, and data processing have also contributed to the increasing use of LCMS-based clinical testing. A 2013 study demonstrated the level of advance by identifying 4,000 yeast proteins in one hour of LCMS run time, identifying approximately 75 proteins/min at a rate 100 times faster than studies a decade prior. 15 Targeted peptide-centric assays are advantageous when sensitivity is paramount over the quantity of identified targets. Targeted assays often rely on tandem MS with high speed, but relatively low accuracy, quadrupoles. 16 Quadrupoles can be used to select ions for fragmentation with quantification of fragment ions by other quadrupoles in single reaction monitoring (SRM). They can also be used in conjunction with high resolution systems in single ion monitoring (SIM) and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). SRM relies on fragmentation which requires a priori the mass to charge ratio (m/z) of both the peptide ion of interest and its dominant ions produced during fragmentation. Commonly, the collision energy is optimized for each peptide fragment in order to maximize efficiency and signal. SIM uses higher resolution scans in lieu of fragmentation, which requires a priori only an approximate m/z ratio for the peptide. In SIM targeted assays, the peptide ion's exact mass is extracted post-run during data processing. Two studies have shown that SIM scans with \u226560,000 resolution produce selectivity comparable to SRM. 17, 18 PRM targeted assays combine fragmentation and high resolution molecule monitoring. In contrast to SIM, isolated ions are subjected to fragmentation. Post-run data processing then calculates quantification from the highresolution accurate mass of the fragment ions. For proteins with only one available peptide target, PRM is the most selective technique in modern proteomics. 19, 20 Due to the high sensitivity of targeted LCMS assays, background signal is of central concern. Peptides must be selected that are unique in one or more of the following characteristics to be truly diagnostic; m/z, peptide sequence, or hydrophobicity. Due to the complexity of the human background thousands of peptides may be possible that are within 0.1 Da in m/z. 21 In the case of ions with high m/z similarity, fragmentation to reveal peptides with sequences of low homology to the background can be used to easily discern these targets. The elution time of the peptides, once characterized and monitored with internal standards can be utilized to distinguish between even highly similar peptides, including sequences that are chemically modified but on alternative residues. 22 To address these concerns an increasing number of in silico tools have been developed that can speed the identification of suitable LCMS targets. Tools such as Picky, 23 the Phosphopedia, 22 the Peptide Manager, and Purple 1 , and Skyline 24 allow the removal of peptides from theoretical proteome backgrounds or the intelligent selection of peptide targets based on other parameters. Peptide retention times can be calculated based on amino acid hydrophobicity calculations, although the inclusion of internal reference calibration standards such as ProCal are necessary for adjustments to different chromatographic conditions. 25 In traditional LCMS targeted assay development, once suitable targets are identified, peptides are then synthesized, and ideal fragment ions are selected for use following rounds of selection and optimization. One way to improve development time is by using databases of experimental fragmentation data such as the PeptideAtlas. 26 However, peptide fragmentation follows specific energetic patterns, resulting primarily in fragments caused by separation at the peptide bond. It is therefore possible to create theoretical spectral libraries in silico from peptide sequence alone. Theoretical spectral libraries are especially useful when the biological samples are unavailable. New tools that employ deep learning algorithms have been demonstrated to produce theoretical MS2 spectra superior to previous prediction models and, in the absence of true experimental data, are the best resources currently available. 27, 28 These deep learning algorithms can learn from vast libraries of experimental data to predict the fragmentation patterns of new peptide sequences that they are given. One such algorithm, PROSIT, uses the vast synthetic human peptide libraries, from the ProteomeTools project 29 for its training dataset. Due to the high quality of the 450,000 synthetic peptides experimentally fragmented in ProteomeTools to date, PROSIT has been demonstrated to create spectral libraries that are, in some cases, superior to experimentally derived in-house spectral libraries. 30 In this study, we describe a in silico approach to identify unique peptides presented during viral infection of human cells. Using a stepwise elimination approach, we outline strategies to begin with a theoretical protein sequence and remove peptides with homology in clinically relevant systems. By removing peptides with homology to human and the relevant human microbiome, we can eliminate many targets that would produce false positive tests for the virus in any healthy person. We further improve on this by removing peptides that could be present in diseases with a similar clinical presentation. By utilizing the data in public repositories, we can determine the protein targets with the highest abundance as well as the highest likelihood of being diagnostic in different assays. We further apply this method toward the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected materials by identifying regions of variability in field isolates identified to date and flag these peptides, as diagnostics targeted on these peptides may lead to false negatives. The restricted target list may be utilized toward the generation of immunological based assays such as ELISA or immunoswabs 2 or provide peptides of value as vaccine targets.",

Primer design must be optimized and may be adversely affected by unknown complex matrices such as in human stool where the true depth of the microbiome may be unknown. 39 PCR-based assays have also been considered cost-prohibitive in some areas of clinical microbiology compared to other assays. 40 A comparison of the relative sensitivity of PCR and protein based assays is challenging due to the differences in nomenclature and in the actual targets being analyzed. A comparison of detection limits of real-time (RT) PCR and other methods for Giardia pathogens in human stool determined revealed conflicting results. When compared to a rapid immunoassay for Giardia lambia, PCR was found inferior to both a rapid immunoassay and manual microscopic analysis. A later similar work compared assays for Giardia intestinalis and concluded that RT-PCR was a superior method to ELISA or microscopic analysis. In addressing the detection of emerging pathogens PCR requires several steps to be deployed en masse. First, a genomic sequence must be generated from which primers can be designed. These primers must be evaluated for cross-reactions in clinical samples and these reagents must be generated in bulk, subjected to quality control (QC) procedures and shipped to the site of testing. The lead time for these reagents has been well-publicized in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, as has the challenges in quality of the primers for an assay deployed by the US CDC in February, 2020. 41 A summary of relevant assays is shown in Table 1 . ELISA based assays for SARS-CoV display the least sensitivity of the these assays with detections in nanograms/mL. 3 ImmunoSwab assays first described for SARS-CoV and recently shown to provide rapid utility for SARS-CoV-2 report sensitivity in the former case of 10 picograms/mL. 2 Due to the high similarity of the two platforms we hypothesized that the SARS-CoV-2 assay will be of similar performance. Two examples of optimized peptide pharmacokinetics assays in serum have demonstrated the utility of rapid LCMS based targeted assays that can achieve limits of detection and assay time comparable to current validated assays.

Given its widespread use, high efficiency and speed of digestion, we chose to develop methods that exclusively use the proteolytic enzyme trypsin, which produces \"tryptic peptides.\" Sequencing grade trypsin exhibits high efficiency cleavage at unmodified (1) arginine and (2) lysine residues unless followed by a proline. Trypsin also has the advantage of leaving a terminal basic residue at the cleavage site, which increases the likelihood of complete fragment ion coverage from the charged terminal. 48 Due to these reasons, trypsin is utilized unless the protein sequence has an abnormally high or low number of lysine or arginine residues. A very high frequency of the residues (such as Lysine-rich proteins) will create very short peptides that could be uninformative for protein identification. A very low frequency of the residues will create very large peptides, or undigested (\"intact\") proteins in some cases, that are difficult to detect and fragment. Our theoretical trypsin digest of the 2019-nCoVpFASTA1 database produced tryptic peptides with average lengths of 8 to 18 amino acids. These results indicate that trypsin digestion is an appropriate choice for detection of these viral proteins.",

To demonstrate the utility of our pipeline, we have provided the minimum materials for data processing for both DDA and DIA untargeted proteomics methods with FASTA databases, spectral libraries and by predicting relevant PTMs for consideration. To broaden the number of labs that can apply our methods, we optimized run parameters for widely used LCMS systems compatible with Skyline, representing instruments from five companies.
