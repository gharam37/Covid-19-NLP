The case fatality rate (CFR) was established at 1.6% in South Korea, 3.04% in China, 10.09% in Italy, and 7.38% in Spain, but the latter might be overestimated since many mild cases have not been spotted. CFR may depend on the quality of the health care received by the patient, detection capacity of each country, previous conditions and age of the patient and also, and probably the most relevant number, the effort in diagnosing, that would rise up the numbers of confirmed infected people (WHO 2020a) .",

It is important to remark that not knowing the real numbers of infected people does not significantly affect the power of the approach we propose here, since the comparison of different scenarios (e.g. reducing R0 after a day or another) uses the same base model. Hence, we can say that the measure that works better in the model, would work better in the real world as well. Besides, the results of this model would improve if we could adjust all the parameters to the real situation. Then, we could build a more robust model.
