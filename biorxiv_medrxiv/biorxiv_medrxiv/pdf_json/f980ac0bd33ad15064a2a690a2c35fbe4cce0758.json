As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, it is essential to monitor single nucleotide 33 polymorphisms in the virus and to continue to isolate circulating viruses to determine viral 34 genotype and phenotype using in vitro and in vivo infection models. 35",

SARS-CoV-2/SB2 additionally contained a non-synonymous 196 substitution at position 2832 (K856R in ORF1ab polyprotein) and three regions with mutations 197 or a deletion supported by a minority of sequencing reads, while SARS-CoV-2/SB3-TYAGNC 198 only had an additional synonymous substitution in ORF1ab polyprotein (Y925Y) plus a minority 199 of sequencing reads supporting another synonymous substitution in the ORF3a protein (I7I). As 200 such, SARS-CoV-2/SB3-TYAGNC was used for subsequent studies as best representative of a 201 clinical viral isolate. Raw sequencing reads for each isolate are available in NCBI BioProject 202 PRJNA624792. Only sequencing reads that aligned by Bowtie2 to the MN908947.3 SARS-CoV-203 2 genome were included in the deposited sequence files. 204 205 To determine the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in human structural and immune cells, we 206 infected Calu-3 (lung adenocarcinoma epithelial), THF (telomerase life extended human 207 S1) with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. We monitored virus 211 replication over a period of 72 hours in the cell lines (Figure 2). We also determined virus 212 replication in PBMCs from healthy donors over a period of 48 hours (Figure 2). SARS-CoV-2 213 propagated to high titres in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells (Figure 2). SARS-CoV-2 did not replicate 214 efficiently in THF cells (Figure 2). Interestingly, human immune cell lines and primary PBMCs 215 from healthy donors did not support SARS-CoV-2 replication (Figure 2) 216 217 To further support virus replication data, we imaged infected human epithelial, fibroblast and 218 immune cells using electron microscopy after 48 hrs of infection with SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of 219 0.01 (Figure 3). We scanned 10 different fields per cell type, each using four different 220 magnifications of 2600x, 8500x, 17500x and 36000x to determine if the cell populations 221 contained virus-like particles. Virus-like particles were detected in 7/10 fields in Vero E6 cells 222 and 8/10 fields in Calu-3 cells (Figure 3, panels A and B).

We infected a range of human cell populations with 244 SARS-CoV-2/SB3-TYAGNC to identify cell types that can support productive infection of 245 SARS-CoV-2. Both Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells supported SARS-CoV-2 replication to high titres 246 (Figure 2), as reported in other recent studies (24, 25). Previously, SARS-CoV was also shown to 247 replicate efficiently in Vero E6 cells (22). Vero E6 cells are immunodeficient, with deficiencies 248 in innate antiviral interferon signaling, which makes them ideal candidates for virus isolation 249 (26). However, to enable studies on SARS-CoV-2-host interactions, it is important to identify 250 human lung epithelial cells with intact immune responses that can support SARS-CoV-2 251 replication.

Furthermore, hTERT life-257 extended human fibroblast cells (THF) also did not support virus replication (have shown that human immune cells, such as THP-1 cell lines are susceptible 260 to SARS-CoV infection (23). In our study, human immune cell populations, including THP-1-261 derived cell lines and primary cells (PBMCs) did not support productive SARS-CoV-2 262 replication (Figure 2). Interestingly, although primary CD4 + T cells did not support productive 263 virus replication, we observed virus-like particles in these cells by electron microscopy (Figure 264 3, panel C). This is consistent with a recent report by Wang and colleagues where they 265 demonstrated that human T cell lines are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and pesudotyped viruses 266 (30). However, the study by Wang et al. did not quantify virus titres in the supernatant from 267 infected cells. In our study, we could not detect any replication competent virus in the 268 supernatant that was collected from SARS-CoV-2 infected CD4 + T cells (Figure 3). Human 269 immune cells lack expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (31) 270 (https://www.proteinatlas.org), the functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2 (1, 32). Thus, although it 271 is intriguing that CD4 + T cells may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, our data show that these cells 272 are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. 273 274",
