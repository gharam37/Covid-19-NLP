            "text": "The aim of our work was to better understand misclassification errors in identification of true cases of COVID-19 and to study the impact of these errors in epidemic curves. We examined publically available time-series data of laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, the causal agent for COVID-19, to try to explore, using a Bayesian approach, about the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR-based diagnostic test. Data originated from Alberta, Canada (available on 3/28/2020) and city of Philadelphia, USA (available on 3/31/2020). Our analysis revealed that the data were compatible with near-perfect specificity but it was challenging to gain information about sensitivity (prior and posterior largely overlapped). We applied these insights to uncertainty/bias analysis of epidemic curves into jurisdictions under the assumptions of both improving and degrading sensitivity. If the sensitivity improved from 60 to 95%, the observed and adjusted epidemic curves likely fall within the 95% confidence intervals of the observed counts. However, bias in the shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced, if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60-70% range. In the extreme scenario, hundreds of undiagnosed cases, even among tested, are possible, potentially leading to further unchecked contagion should these cases not self-isolate. The best way to better understand bias in the epidemic curves of COVID-19 due to errors in testing is to empirically evaluate misclassification of diagnosis in clinical settings and apply this knowledge to adjustment of epidemic curves, a task for which the Bayesian method we presented is well-suited.",

            "text": "It is well known that outcome misclassification can bias epidemiologic results, yet is infrequently quantified and adjusted for in results. In the context of infectious disease outbreaks, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2019-20, false positive diagnoses may lead to a waste of limited resources, such as testing kits, hospital beds, and absence of the healthcare workforce. On the other hand, false negative diagnoses contribute to uncontrolled spread of contagion, should these cases not self-isolate. In an ongoing epidemic, where test sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) of case ascertainment are fixed, prevalence of the outcome (infection), determines whether false positives or negatives dominate. For COVID-19, Goldstein & Burstyn (2020) show that suboptimal test Sn despite excellent Sp results in an overestimation of cases in the early stages of an outbreak, and substantial underestimation of cases as prevalence increases to levels seen at the time of writing. However, understanding the true scope of the pandemic depends on precise insights into accuracy of laboratory tests used for case confirmation. Undiagnosed cases are of particular concern; they arise from untested persons who may or may not have symptoms (under-ascertainment) and from errors in testing among those selected for the test (inconclusive results). We focus on misclassified patients only due to errors in tests that were performed: according to the World Health Organization's case definition, these may be deemed probable cases when a test result was inconclusive (WHO, 2020) . Presently, the accuracy of testing for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, the causal agent for COVID-19, is unknown in Canada and the USA, but globally it is reported that Sp exceeds Sn (COVID-19 Science Report: Diagnostics 2020, Fang et al. 2020; Ai et al. 2020) .",

            "text": "In a typical scenario, clinical and laboratory validation studies are needed to fully quantify the performance of a diagnostic assay (measured through Sn and Sp). However, during a pandemic, limited resources are likely to be allocated to testing and managing patients, rather than performing the validation work. After all, imperfect testing can still shed a crude light on the scope of the public health emergency. Indeed, counts of observed positive and negative tests can be informative about Sn and Sp, because certain combinations of these parameters are far more likely to be compatible with data and reasonable assertions about true positive tests. In general, more severe cases of disease are expected at the onset of an outbreak (and reflected in tested samples as strong clinical suspicion for the test produces higher likelihood of having the disease) but the overall prevalence in the population would remain low. Then, as the outbreak progresses with more public awareness and consequently both symptomatic and asymptomatic people being tested, the overall prevalence of disease is expected to rapidly increase while the severity of the disease at a population level is tempered. It is reasonable to expect, as was indeed reported anecdotally early in the COVID-19 outbreak, for laboratory tests to be inaccurate, because the virus itself and its unique identifying features exploited in the test are themselves uncertain, and laboratory procedures can contain errors ahead of standardization and regulatory approval. Again, anecdotally, Sn was supposed to be worse than Sp, which is congruent with reports of early diagnostic tests from China (Fang et al. 2020; Ai et al. 2020) , with both Sn and Sp improving as the laboratories around the world rushed to perfect testing (Konrad et al. 2020; US FDA 2020; Corman et al. 2020) to approach performance in tests for similar viruses (e.g. Binsaeed et al. 2011; Merckx et al., 2017 ) . Using publicly available time-series data of laboratory testing results for SARS-CoV-2 and our prior knowledge of infectious disease outbreaks, we may be able to gain insights into the true accuracy of the diagnostic assay.",

The prior distribution for prevalence is constructed by specifying lower and upper bounds for prevalence at each knot, with a uniform distribution in between these bounds. The prior distribution of sensitivity is constructed similarly, but with a modification to encourage more smoothness in the variation over time (see Appendix B for full details). The test specificity is considered constant over time, with a uniform prior distribution between specified lower and upper bounds.",

The data directly inform only the product of prevalence and sensitivity. Trying to separate the two can be regarded statistically as an \"unidentified\" problem (while mathematicians might speak of an ill-posed inverse problem, or engineers might refer to a \"blind source separation\" challenge). However, some circumstances might be more amenable to some degree of separation. In particular, with piecewise-linear structure for sensitivity and prevalence, strong quadratic patterns in the observed data, if present, could be particularly helpful in guiding separation. On the other hand, if little or no separation can be achieved, the analysis will naturally revert back to a sensitivity analysis, with the a priori uncertainty about test sensitivity and infection prevalence being acknowledged.",

However, early in the COVID-19 outbreak problems with the sensitivity of the diagnostic test were widely reported owing to specimen collection and reagent preparation, but not quantified. Based on these reports, we posited a lower bound on prior Sn of 0.6 and an upper bound of 0.9. We expected Sp to be high and selected a time-invariant prior uniform bounded by 0.95 and 1. Prevalence of test-positive samples likely changed over time as well --for example due to prioritization of testing based on age, occupation, and morbidity (CDC, 2020) --but it is difficult to quantify what this would be, because it is different from population prevalence of infected yielded by a random sample (governed by known population dynamics models).

We simulated various values of using Beta distribution ranging in means from 0.60 to 0.95, with a fixed standard S\u00f1 deviation of 0.05 (parameters set using https://www.desmos.com/calculator/kx83qio7yl ). It is apparent that epidemic curves generated in this manner will have higher counts than the observed curves, and our main interest is to illustrate how much the underestimation can bias the depiction. Our uncertainty/bias analysis only reflects systematic errors for illustrative purposes and under the common assumptions (and experience) that they dwarf random errors.

The data in both jurisdictions is consistent with the hypothesis that the number of truly infected is being under-estimated , even though observed counts tend to fall within 95% credible intervals of posterior distribution of the counts of true positive tests ( Figure B) . The under-diagnosis is more pronounced when there are both more positive cases and the prevalence of positive tests is higher, i.e. in Philadelphia related to Alberta. In Philadelphia, the posterior of prevalence was between 5 and 24% (100's of positive tests a day in late March) but in Alberta, the median of the posterior of prevalence was under 3% (30 to 50 positive tests a day in late March). This is not surprising because the number of false negatives is proportional to observed cases for the same sensitivity. The specificity appears to be high enough for the observed prevalence . Posterior distributions are indistinguishable from the priors, such that we are still left with an impression that sensitivity of COVID-19 tests can be anywhere between 0.6 and 0.9, centered around 0.75. One can speculate on the departure of the posterior distribution from uniform prior given that the posterior appears concentrated somewhat around the prior mean of 0.75 (more lines in Figure D near the mean than the dotted edges that bound the prior). However, any such signal is weak and there is no evidence of a time-trend that was allowed by the model.",

The right-hand panel of Figure E indicates how, as expected, if sensitivity improves over time (green lines), then the true epidemic curve is expected to be flatter than the observed. It also appears that observed and true curves may well fall within the range of 95% confidence intervals around the observed counts (blue lines). If sensitivity decreases over time (brown lines), then the true epidemic curve is expected to be steeper than the observed. In either scenario, there can be an under-counting of cases by nearly a factor of two, most apparent as the incidence grows, such that on day March 24, 2020 (t=19), there may have been almost 120 cases vs. 62 observed. This is alarming, because misdiagnosed patients can spread infection if they have not self-isolated (perhaps a negative test results provided a false sense of security) and it is impossible to know who they are among thousands of symptomatic persons tested around that time per day (Table A1) . 8 .

As in Alberta, when misclassification errors increase, uncertainty about epidemic curves also increases. It is also apparent that the shape of the epidemic curve, especially when counts are high, can be far steeper than that inferred assuming perfect testing. The right-hand panel of Figure F indicates that if sensitivity improves over time (green lines), then the true epidemic curve is expected to be practically indistinguishable from the observed one in Philadelphia: e.g. it is within random variation of observed counts represented by 95% confidence intervals (blue lines). This is comforting, because this seems to be the most plausible scenario of improvement in time in quality of testing (identification of truly infected). However, if sensitivity decreases over time (brown lines), then the under-counting of cases by the hundreds in late March 2020 cannot be ruled out. We again have the same concern as for Alberta: misdiagnosed patients can spread infection unimpeded and it is impossible to know who they are among the hundreds of symptomatic persons tested in late March 2020 (Table A2 ). In all examined scenarios, in both Alberta and Philadelphia, the lack of sensitivity in testing seems to matter far less when the observed counts are low early in the epidemic. The gap between observed and adjusted counts grows as the number of observed cases increases. This reinforces the importance of early testing, at least with respect to describing the time-course of the epidemic, even with imperfect technology (Goldstein & Burstyn, 2020) . 9 .

Although we are confident that typical specificity exceeds 0.98 , there is very little learning about sensitivity from prior to posterior. However, it is important to not generalize this lack of learning about sensitivity, because it can occur when stronger priors on prevalence are justified and/or when there are more pronounced trends in prevalence of positive tests. We therefore encourage every jurisdiction with suitable data to attempt to gain insights into accuracy of tests using our method: now that the method to do so exists, it is simpler and cheaper than laboratory and clinical validation studies. However, validation studies, with approaches like the one illustrated in Burstyn et al. (2009) , are still the most reliable means of determining accuracy of a diagnostic test.",

This may also have implications for understanding the proportion of the population non-susceptible to COVID-19. As researchers attempt to develop pharmaceutical prophylaxis (i.e., a vaccine) combined with a greater number of people recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, having insight into the herd threshold will be important for resolving current and future outbreaks.

There are some discrepancies in the data that should be resolved in time, like fewer cases tested positive than there are in epidemic curve in Alberta, but the urgency of the current situation justifies doing our best with what we have now . We also make some strong ad hoc assumptions about breakpoints in segmented regression of time-trends in sensitivity and prevalence, further assuming that the same breakpoints are suitable for trends in both parameters. Although not as much of an issue based on our analysis, we do need to consider imperfect specificity, creating false positives, albeint nowhere near the magnitude of false negatives in the middle of an outbreak. This results in wasted resources. In ideal circumstances we employ a two stage test: a highly sensitive serological assay, that if positive triggers a PCR-based assay. Thus we would require two samples per individual: blood and NP swab. Two-stage tests would resolve a lot of uncertainty and speculation over a single PCR test combined with signs and symptoms. Indeed, this is the model used for diagnosis of other infectious diseases, such as HIV and Hepatitis C. Our work also only focuses on validity of laboratory tests, not sensitivity and specificity of the entire process of identification of cases that involves selection for testing via a procedure that is designed to induce systemic biases relative to the population.",

            "text": "The above comprises a complete stochastic generative model. Hence, Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling from the joint distribution of all latent quantities given all observed quantities is feasible. The latents include w, Sn A:1:K , (Sn B,1 , Sn B,K ), Sp, r 1:K, Y 1:T, Y A,1:T , and Y B,1:T . The observed data are the two series: and n 1:T . Y * 1:T To elaborate on the underidentified nature of the statistical problem, it is simplest to consider the case of Sp=1, in which case the observed data are governed by E( )/n t = r t Sn t so that indeed asking the data to completely Y t * distinguish Sn t from r t is impossible, at least in the absence of prior information. If the piecewise-linear assumptions on Sn t and r t are valid, however, then one might anticipate some partial information coming forward. Consider a single interval between two knots. If the data signal on this interval happens to be highly linear, then we have a severe paucity of information, as two coefficients describing the composite signal are being asked to inform about the four coefficients describing the two constituent signals, albeit with help from the prior bounds on the constituent signals. On the other hand, if the data signal happens to be quadratic, then we still face an underidentified situation, but at least now there are three pieces of information from the composite signal to partially inform the four descriptors on the constituent quantities.",
