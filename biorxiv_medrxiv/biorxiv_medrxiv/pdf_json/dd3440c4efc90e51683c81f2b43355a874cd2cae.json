Mathematical modelling has been used widely to understand the spread of disease in populations. 7 One of the aims of the modelling is to estimate parameters that are critical to the spread of diseases such as basic reproductive number or R0 and incubation period. 8 This is quite useful in the scenario of early spread of disease to plan future strategies.",

The most reliable information in this database is regarding the daily reported incidence of COVID cases. Also, it contains aggregated information on total confirmed cases, total death and total recovery. We did not use variables with limited information. The data was scraped on to R software on 12 th April 2020, cleaned and reshaped for the current analysis. 12 Package ggplot2 was mainly used to create figures along with features from base R. 13 We defined serial interval as the time difference in diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in infectee and infector. 14 We assumed serial interval and generation time to be same. Growth rate was computed from this incidence curve by fitting a log-linear model 15 and basic reproduction number (R0) was obtained from previously calculated serial interval. We also calculated time dependent reproductive number (Rt) to show the change in infectivity over time. State-wise growth was measured using the slope from a linear model.To estimate an R0 for projection purposes, in addition to log linear, we also estimated R0 from other methods such as Exponential growth (EG), Maximum likelihood estimation (ML) and Sequential Bayesian Method (SB) and Estimation of time dependent reproduction numbers (TD). 16 We selected Sequential Bayesian Method (SB) to account for stochasticity in incidence curves as the priors change with time and are drawn from posterior distribution from time dependent informative priors. 16 Conceptually, susceptible individuals become infectious (i.e., move from the susceptible compartment to the infectious compartment), and then ultimately recover from the infection (i.e., move from the infectious compartment to the recovered compartment). The rates at which they move from one compartment to another depend on the proportion of the population in each of these compartments, as well as the transmission and recovery rates associated with the disease. We modified standard SIR models to accommodate an additional compartment for deaths by assuming transition probabilities, the susceptible-infectiousrecovered/Death (SIRD) model. Our model can be represented by the following ordinary differential equation",

As these parameters could not be estimated directly from the data, we back calculated \u03b2 from R0 which was computed previously using Sequential Bayesian method. \u03b3 was calculated from infectious period -(1/ infectious period). Case fatality rate (\u03b1) can be defined as deaths out of confirmed cases. \u03c1 was estimated as inverse of time to death. We did not have \u03c1 from our data and hence used estimated range of 2-8 weeks from the WHO report. 17 We used 5 weeks as the value of \u03c1 for our study. The values of the parameters are as follows: R0=1.85, b=0.13, \u03b3 =0.07, \u03b1 =0.035 and \u03c1=0.028.",

A recent study by Prem et al suggests that mitigation measures may be helpful only in delaying the infection from reaching its peak. 24 Thus, it implies that the measures would likely prevent immediate flooding of hospitals preventing people from obtaining adequate care. The epidemic is yet to reach its peak in India which we expect to be around mid-July and early August.

Our findings are based on simulations and further measures at policy level can alter the trajectory of the disease. Lipsitch et al recommends a strategy combining epidemiological studies, testing and lab studies as more effective strategy in generating evidence for suppressing the epidemic. 26 Our analysis has certain limitations. Firstly, there may be underreporting of cases and lack of validated data for research purposes available to the public.However, we compared the incidence from our dataset to the aggregated numbers elsewhere like European Disease Prevention and Control 23 and Worldometer 5 and the figures were similar. Another issue in estimating the parameters is the presence of super spreaders and asymptomatic cases. The estimated proportion of asymptomatic cases can be as high as 10% in the population. 27 The virus can be spread around during asymptomatic stage and delays from onset to reporting or treatment can be as high as 11 days. 28 Nonetheless, pooling estimates across several studies will aid in computing values that are closer to the true estimates.",

However, the rising incidence and pattern of spread is suggestive of community transmission and is likely to increase cases in the future. The availability of individual level data is critical to assess the effectiveness of ongoing measures and plan future strategies. There is a need to increasingly fund infectious disease research and epidemiologic studies and make that data available in the public domain. Future studies could focus on studying genetic variations in asymptomatic individuals and those index cases with higher disease transmission rates. There needs to be a renewed thinking of health systems particularly regarding emergency preparedness and optimal utilization of scarce resources. Epidemiologists need to be considered in decision making and developing disease control strategies. Furthermore, there needs to be concerted action at global level to contain the virus including joint research and developing vaccines and drugs. All the current gains may be reversed rapidly if air travel and social mixing resumes rapidly. For the time being, these must be resumed only in a phased manner, and should be back to normal levels only after we are prepared to deal with the disease with efficient tools like vaccine or a medicine.",
