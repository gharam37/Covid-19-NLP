The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was called \"CoronaVirus Infectious Disease 2019\" (COVID-19) by WHO. COVID-19 has been declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO [1] . The virus belongs to Coronaviridae family which consists of single-stranded, non-segmented positive-sense RNA genome of size approximately 26-32 kb [2] [3] . To date, six known HCoVs have been identified, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV); except SARS and MERS, other four were universally dispersed in the human population and causes common cold infections among one-third of human populations [4] [5] .",

The beginning of SARS-CoV-2 was linked to a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown aetiology connected to a local Huanan South China Seafood Market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 [11] . It is now emerged as pandemic condition and World Health Organization (WHO) report as on April 17, 2020 at 2:00am CEST, there include a total of 2,034,802 confirmed cases for Corona and 1,35,163 deaths worldwide which includes 212 countries, areas or territories with cases [1] WHO region wise data in Fig.1A -B. The fuss about the source of the virus and its intermediate host is still not yet confirmed. However, so far, there are still controversies about the source of the virus and its intermediate host [3] . The evolutionary analysis shows that the present strain of coronavirus is more similar to Bat coronavirus isolate RaTG13 (GenBank No.: MN996532.1), with 96.2% nucleotide homology in the whole genome [12] [13] [14] . Other groups suggest that pangolin, mink, snake, turtle may be potential intermediate hosts for the virus but not conclusively [3, [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

The complete country wise cumulative confirmed cases and cumulative deaths between April 7 th 2020 and April 17 th 2020 was calculated and the percentage wise confirmed cases and death rate in 10 days was calculated and shown in the Continued testing of people, irrespective of symptoms and travel history is the need of time to scrutinize the asymptomatic carrier people among the group of population, will cut down the number of death rate. This April 2020 plays major role in the steady death toll increase among various countries mentioned above. Early diagnosis, appropriate treatment, containment zone formation, Quarantine the people with symptoms may help us to flat the rate of infection and death rate. Fig. 5A -C.

The algorithm produced a tree with highest log likelihood value (-632944.00) and also formed a bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 50 replicates. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together was shown next to the branches. There were a total of 29903 positions in the final dataset. The lengths of the branches represent the amount of change that is estimated to have occurred between a pair of nodes. Alternative evolutionary trees are produced by bootstrapping analysis under maximum likelihood model. This is done through 50 iterations and when we recover the same node after 50 iterations then the node in the tree is well supported. Upon boostrap, Fig. 2. data showed all the three Bat-SARS-like coronavirus in closed group branching to the China, USA and India strains. Though the first complete genome NC045512.2.1-29903 Wuhan-Hu-1 (blue triangle) was closely branched to MN996528.1 [Wuhan, Hubei, China], MT093571.1 [Swedan], MT039890.1 [Korean travelled from Wuhan, China], MT066156.1 [First case of Italy], MT007544.1 [Australia], the Bat SARS virus, precisely RaTG13 and SL-Covzc45 were completely close and neighborhood with the CoVid-19 isolated from Wuhan-genomes MT198652.2 (Spain), MT123292.2 (Guangzhou, China) MT012098.1 (Kerala, India) and LR757995.1 (Hong Kong, China). The purpose of this study is to highlight the key role of Wuhan, China trace to Indian patients, Hence, the two India-Kerala state isolates were specifically traced by multiple alignments of the genome sequences using NCBI tool and Multalin, we found MT012098 consist of 29,854 bps and MT050493.1 consist of 29,851bps, three basepairs were missing in the initial sequence of the second isolate. Whereas totally, 9 point mutations were identified in this two genomes of which, 8 were C-T/T-C change and only one mutation at position 22,772 T/G change with 99% identity score, complete details recorded in theTable 2. The second strain from India MT050493.1 was in close association with LR757996.Wuhan, China), MN938384.1 (Guangdong, China) and LC528232.1 (Isolated from a patient in cruise ship, Japan).",

Currently, the diagnoses were carried out for the patients with clinical symptoms and or travel history or their contacts. In near future, the Government has planned to test everyone with symptoms irrespective of travel or contact history. This will curb the case of COVID-19 in India. The world wide data alarms USA, Italy, Spain, UK, Iran, Netherlands and other countries with high rate of death cases, warrants early diagnosis and treatment, though there is no specific drug against COVID-19.
