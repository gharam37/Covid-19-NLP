As of 24 March 2020, 25 WHO situation reports (SITREPs), indicated 45 African countries reported at least one 26 laboratory-confirmed infection (\"reported case\") of COVID--19 (World Health Organization 27 2020). Reported cases underestimate actual infections due to the mix of mild symptoms (3, 4), 28 the similarity of symptoms common to the region (5), and weak surveillance (6). However, 29 assuming constant reporting activity, reported cases grow in proportion to the underlying 30 epidemic, and even with under-ascertainment of the number of actual cases, reported cases 31 provide a useful indicator of stress on healthcare systems. We can use this surrogate for the real 32 epidemic to forecast future trends, and understand the consequences of a slow public health 33 response and what preparations need to be made now. 34 .
