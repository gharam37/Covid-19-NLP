Spike(S) protein, one of the structural proteins of this virus plays key role in receptor (ACE2) binding and thus virus entry. Thus, this protein has attracted scientists for detailed study and therapeutic targeting. As the 2019 novel coronavirus takes its course throughout the world, more and more sequence analyses are been done and genome sequences getting deposited in various databases. From India two clinical isolates have been sequenced and the full genome deposited in GenBank. We have performed sequence analyses of the spike protein of the Indian isolates and compared with that of the Wuhan, China (where the outbreak was first reported). While all the sequences of Wuhan isolates are identical, we found point mutations in the Indian isolates. Out of the two isolates one was found to harbour a mutation in its Receptor binding domain (RBD) at position 407. At this site arginine (a positively charged amino acid) was",

Scientists across the globe are trying to elucidate the genome characteristics using phylogenetic, structural and mutational studies [4] . Spike protein, one of the key proteins of SARS-CoV2 is involved directly with virus infection as it is involved in receptor recognition, attachment, binding and entry [5] [6] [7] . Sequence analyses of the spike protein can give us a plethora of information which can be instrumental in drug and vaccine development. In the present piece of work, we retrieved S protein sequences of the SARS-CoV2 from different geographical locations to identify notable features of S protein especially in Indian isolates. These analyses include identification of mutational signatures and their correlation with virus infection. Our analyses show unique point mutations in the spike protein of the Indian subtypes.",

Panel A shows structure without deletion of amino acid tyrosine at position 144.Pnel B shows coiling of the strands rearranged after the deletion On the other hand, at position 407, the same isolate had a substitution mutation of R (Arginine) to I (Isoleucine) (R407I). The receptor binding domain or RBD of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 lie between amino acids 331-524[8]. Thus, the mutation R407I lie in the RBD which play key role in receptor binding. Arginine is a positively charged amino acid and Isoleucine is a hydrophobic amino acid with C-beta branch. While positively charged amino acid could be more exposed, hydrophobic amino acids secure themselves away from the outer aqueous environment. Since nature of these amino acids are so different, a substitution of this nature might change the conformation locally and can impose functional alterations i.e. with respect to receptor interaction. To confirm this theory further, we ran a secondary structure prediction using CFSSP server and found that while in case of Wuhan isolate, this region had helix only (H)(Figure 4A), in case of R407I in Indian isolate there was introduction of sheets (E) (Figure 4B). This suggests that a change in secondary structure occurs in case of RBD of spike protein of isolate 29 of the 2019 novel Coronavirus of India.",

Considering the nature of valine being destabilizing causing distortion, this mutation might have implications in viral membrane fusion subject to validation. Structure of the spike glycoprotein was retrieved from the protein data bank (PDB ID: 6VXX) (Figure 5). The residue alanine at position 930 though not associated with the active site of the molecule stabilizes majority of the chain A moiety in the protein due to its hydrophobic nature. On substitution with Valine in the same position, it can potentially change the affinity of the molecule towards its receptor. Thus, taken together the mutations in S protein of Indian isolates can potentially alter virus entry and thus determine the infectivity of the virus. More sequence information along with mutational studies on receptor virus binding will further help strengthen this observation.
