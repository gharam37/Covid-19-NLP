We study sequential vaccination of individuals in networks, where there is a limit on the number of individuals that can be vaccinated every day. Effective allocation of vaccine will play a critical role in preventing the spread and reducing the effects of a future pandemic. We derive methods for calculating upper and lower bounds of the expected number of infected individuals, as well as provide estimates on the number of vaccinations that is needed for containment. We calculate these explicitly on trees, d-dimensional grids, and Erd\u0151s R\u00e9nyi graphs. Finally, we construct a time-dependent budget allocation strategy and demonstrate its superiority over constant budget allocation on real networks following first acquaintance vaccination. Our results provide a principled approach to assess the needed vaccination rate given the social graph topology.",

Vaccination policies define rules for identifying individuals that should be made immune to the spreading epidemic.

Their model assumes slightly modifiable infection rates and a cost function based on a mean field approach. Information-driven vaccination is studied in [9] , showing the spread of the information will promote people to take preventive measures and consequently suppress the epidemic spreading. It was also proposed to only vaccinate those individuals with the most unvaccinated contacts [10] .

The first, and most natural criterion, considers minimizing the number of infected individuals at the end of the infection process. As this criterion is hard to optimize generally [13, 14] , we consider an alternative criterion, which is ultimately easier to evaluate. The containment criterion asks the following question: What is the minimal budget needed to ensure an infection won't reach a certain size? This question can be answered immediately if the first criterion is minimized, whereas knowing the latter does not give us the former. Strictly speaking, this question may be more feasible to answer, and is thus the main focus of our work.

In fact, when only a lower bound in[|I 0 | , \u03b8]] is given, then b L = b L\u03b8 is a lower bound for containment in \u03b8 (i.e., the infection can be contained in expectation with cardinality at most \u03b8). In theory, given mgr/EGR, a controller can choose at each state s t = (I t , B t ) an objective \u03b8 t = |I t | + M t , for some M t \u2208 N. Then, by lower bounding mgr/EGR in [|I t | , \u03b8 t ] and applying Theorem 5.1, a specific budget can be allocated for that state. This process can be repeated at each time step in order to obtain a \"minimal\" budget according to the current lower bound in [|I t | , \u03b8 t ].In contrast to trees and grids (as well as other symmetric topologies), an explicit expression of mgr/EGR is hard to obtain. Even a lower bound may be complicated to express.For this reason, Monte Carlo simulations can be used in order to approximate mgr/EGR. Specifically, let \u03c4 = {u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u T } be T trajectories of length d starting at state s.
