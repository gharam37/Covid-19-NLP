By a simple fact that for any spread of infectious disease, we know that in general it is impossible to find or identify the exact turning point (or critical point) for a big pandemic (which means the behavior of the spread of COVID-19 virus is under control) due to various dynamics and associated uncertainty! But if using the idea to think of the a time period (or say, time interval) instead of an exact time point to identify the true change for the behavior of spread for epidemic disease such as in terms of the number of infectious people have significantly be reduced, plus the population of the exposed (E) are also true under the control to reach to certain low level, then it seems possible for us to identify different phases and stages for the mechanics of the outbreak of infectious disease incorporating with some useful tools such as the iSEIR one we introduced in [28] (see also [38] ).",

It expects that the concept for the prediction of the critical turning period would provide us a better way to prepare the emergency plan for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in the practice, such as working on the estimates of predicted health service utilization and deaths due to COVID-19 by day for the next 4 months for each state in the US (see [3] for more information), countries and regions worldwide. Actually, as reported by Tan [35] (see also Yuan et al. [38] ) by assessing the performance of prediction by using the iSEIR model for the timeline of the spread's mechanics of COVID-19 in Wuhan on dates of Feb.6 and Feb.10, 2020 by using the concept of \"Turning Time Period (Time Period)\" to forecast the time frame for the control of the epidemic outbreak measured by a reduction in the number of people infected, it shows that our iSEIR model (an extension of the SEIR model) works very well to accurately predicted that \"the COVID-19 situation in China would peak around mid-to late February as early as February 7, 2020\". This review also shows that the identification of the Turning Time Period is the key to have a successful implementation for emergency plan as it provides a timeline for effective actions and solutions to combat a pandemic by reducing as much unexpected risk as soon as possible.",

In 1927, Kermack and McKendrick formulated a simple deterministic model called SIR to describe the dynamic mechanism for directly transmitted viral or bacterial agent in a closed population (see [26] ). Since then, scholars have contributed and advanced this field; a significant milestone in the study of Epidemics was the publication of \"The Mathematical Theory of Infectious Diseases\" in 1957 by Bailey (see [27] ). Of these, the famous SEIR model, a core subject in Epidemic discipline (see [3] ), like mentioned above, is the basis for describing the mechanism for the spread of infectious diseases, and has been used in a number of research projects and related applications. In the SEIR model, the \"S\" state refers to the susceptible group (or ignorants) who are susceptible to disease but have not been infected yet; the \"E\" state refers to the exposed group who are infected but are not infectious yet (or lurkers); the \"I\" state refers to those infected who also become infectious; and the \"R\" state refers to those who have recovered from the infection (through treatment or natural recovery) who may or may no longer be infectious, or those who have passed away.",

Every scenario of an epidemic outbreak due to a novel infectious disease carries a similar set of challenges: the unknown nature of the new pathogen/strain, a lack of immediate effective treatment and vaccine, and an ill-prepared public health infrastructure to accommodate the surge in potential patients and need for testing. Public health policies that could alleviate and help prevent the impact and scale of an outbreak require significant and massive governmental and societal implementation of emergency planning and intervention strategies. At present, I want to focus the objective of this paper towards three key issues in approaching these outbreaks: 1) How do we establish a spatiotemporal model for the infectious diseases' outbreak: in order describe the mechanics of the spread of infectious diseases? 2) How do we conduct numerical simulation and risk prediction indicators: in order to conduct numerical simulation based on the real scenes, which can be used to provide an outlook and planning schedule associated with a key period known as the \"Turning Phase\" during the spread of infectious diseases? 3) How do we carry out effective predictive analysis on the epidemic situation of infectious diseases on an ongoing basis: in order to cooperate with dynamic management, support public health emergency plans/services, and support community responses by establishing a coherent bigdata method for data fusion from different sources with different structure.",

In order to have a better way of describing the dynamics of \"Spreading behavior\" in multiplex network at an individual level to community to population levels, we introduced the socalled iSEIR model (individual Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Removed) which operates under a probability perspective for each individual (see reference [28] ) around two years ago as an extension of the classic SEIR one. This iSEIR model allows us to conduct simulations from the individual level located on the nodes of different community networks by incorporating its uncertainty with the probability to conduct random scenarios study with consideration of the corresponding multiplex networks. The behavior distribution of S, E, I and R can also be numerically simulated from the iSEIR model with properly specified values of parameters on population scales (in the change of percentage), population density, and transfer rate and so to have the simulation results given by Figure 3 above.",

Indeed, the SEIR model represents more accurately the spread of an epidemic than the corresponding SIR model that does not take into account the latent period. The SEIR model has a slower growth rate, since after the pathogen invasion the susceptible individuals need to pass through the exposed class before they can contribute to the transmission process, as shown (by Figure I_SEIR model illustration) below:",
