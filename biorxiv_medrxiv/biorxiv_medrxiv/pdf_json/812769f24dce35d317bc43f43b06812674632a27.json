CORD-19 is released together with a set of challenges hosted by Kaggle, mainly focused on automatically extracting structured and actionable information from such a large set of publications. The release of this dataset is a positive call for action directed towards the natural language processing, machine learning and related research communities. This call has been taken up: For example, the ACL conference has announced an emergency NLP COVID-19 workshop which mentions the CORD-19 dataset on its call for papers 2 and a TREC-COVID challenge has been announced on CORD-19 3 .",

            "text": "In order to contribute to an informed use of the CORD-19 dataset, we here present a scientometric analysis of its contents. In particular, we raise some questions on the subject matter delineation of CORD-19. Field or subject delineation is a complex task, which usually benefits from an interplay of information retrieval, or search-based approaches, and bibliometric mapping [16, 34, 18] . We compare the coverage of CORD-19 to the Web of Science and find that CORD-19 on the one hand contains more than just research on COVID-19 and coronaviruses, while on the other hand, it might be missing some content. We then provide an overview of the research it contains, enriching the CORD-19 dataset with data from Dimensions [15] and using both citation analysis and text analysis. Our results show that the CORD-19 corpus broadly focuses on biomedical research on viruses and related health issues, and the articles it contains are quite heterogeneous. CORD-19 contains a core of research directly on COVID-19 and coronaviruses, but in addition it contains many articles on related yet distinct streams of virus research, such as on influenza, molecular biology and public health. Secondly, we discover three periods in the accumulation of literature in this corpus: a pre-SARS (2003) period, a post-SARS period and the current pandemic (2020). We also present a brief analysis of Altmetric [24, 21] data related to the papers in the corpus. We find that recent research (2020) is disproportionately represented in social media and news by Altmetric indicators, especially on Twitter. We conclude by suggesting a critical stance when using CORD-19, and by proposing some directions for future work.",

The top 20 journals by number of publications are given in Figure 1 , highlighting how the corpus is composed of publications from varied sources. The Journal of Virology and PLOS ONE stand out, in particular. The main contributors to the dataset are PMC and Elsevier (Figure 12b) , which have made a large part of their relevant literature openly available. The availability of full texts is relatively high, even if not yet complete, and is proportionally stable over time (Figure 12a ). This is because, even though most publishers and journals have opened up their publications, some have not yet done so. In particular, the Journal of Virology (top by number of papers in , the Journal of Clinical Microbiology and the Journal of Biological Chemistry provide almost no article in full text to this date. Using Dimensions data, we study the number of citations to papers in the corpus ( Figure 13 ). We can observe how the literature in this corpus gained more attention from the early 2000, and how some publications from 2020 are already accumulating citations at an extreme rate. The most cited articles include: \"Epidemiology and causes of preterm birth\" by Goldenberg et al. 4 Except for about 10, 000 articles without any classification, we find that, as expected, the Medical and Health Sciences cover most ground, followed by Biological Sciences (Figure 14 ). The second level FOR classification shows the presence of several sub-areas of these two top level fields, Medical Microbiology being the largest.

Other WoS citation indices were not used, because we do not have access to them. We performed the search in the titles, abstracts, and author keywords of the publications in WoS. Abstracts and keywords are available from 1991 onward. CORD-19 and WoS coverage in publications can then be compared using their DOI or PubMed identifier (PMID). In Figure 3 we show the trends in research output on COVID-19-related diseases. The green line represents the CORD-19 dataset. While this dataset goes back to 1951, for reasons of clarity we only show trends from 1980 to 2019 (n = 42, 496, excluding an additional 4, 095 publications from 2020 and 403 from before 1980).

If we assume that authors use the titles, abstracts, and keywords of their publications to indicate the main focus of their research (by explicitly using terms such as \"corona virus\", \"SARS-CoV\", \"MERS-CoV\", or similar), many CORD-19 publications do not clearly focus on COVID-19 and coronaviruses.

The horizontal and vertical axes have no special meaning. In Figure 6 , labels are shown only for a selection of the terms.

Lastly, another prominent topic started around 2003 and is related to the management of epidemic outbreaks (topic 0). Presently, in 2020, new research is dominated by topics 0 and 10, hence epidemics, outbreak management and COVID-19, especially in view of dedicated patients clinical care.

We constructed a citation network based on references of all papers included in the CORD-19 dataset, as provided by Dimensions. We not only included references to papers part of CORD-19, but also all other references in this directed citation network. These 'external' references provide additional information regarding the knowledge structure of the CORD-19 dataset. For example, two papers may not be immediately connected via papers in the CORD-19 dataset, but they may have common external references. We only use the giant weakly connected component, which amounts to 903, 607 nodes and 1, 985, 767 edges, of which 38, 718 nodes belong to the CORD-19 dataset. This is the citation network that we work with in the remainder of this section. We cluster the citation network using the Leiden algorithm 8 [26] . Each citation link is weighted as 1/k i , where k i is the number of references of publication i. The inclusion of the 'external' references in the context of clustering is also known as extended direct citation [31] . In this approach, the publications contained in CORD-19 are weighted with a so-called node weight of 1, while the 'external' publications are weighted with a weight of 0 (see [31] for more de-tails). We cluster the citation network in a hierarchical fashion. The lowest cluster level, which is most detailed, is clustered using a resolution of 2 \u00b7 10 \u22125 . We then aggregate the citation network according to this clustering, and then cluster the resulting clustered citation network at a resolution of 1 \u00b7 10 \u22125 . We refer to the former clustering solution as the lowest level, and to the latter as the highest level. The 'external' publications help to cluster CORD-19 publications from CORD-19 more accurately.

As can be seen in Table 1 , a total of 28, 146 publications in the CORD-19 dataset (60%) have received some mention in Altmetric. This is a rather high coverage of publications, compared to previous studies [14] , that reported an overall coverage of 21.5% of 2012 publications on Twitter, and about 31% for publications in the biomedical and health sciences. This high coverage is even higher when the focus is on the most recent publications (i.e., those published in the early months of 2020), of which over 80% have received some social media mentioning covered by Altmetric. Table 2 presents a more detailed description of the type of social media events around CORD-19 publications. We selected some of the most relevant sources covered by Altmetric, namely Twitter, blogs, recommendations in F1000Prime, news media mentions, citations in policy documents and citations in Wikipedia entries. Clearly, the most important source is Twitter, which accounts for over 95% of all the (social) media interactions analysed. The second most important source are news mentions (3.6%) and blog citations (0.6%). The observation that news media mentions outperform blogs contrasts with previous studies [14] . This may signal the particular relevance of publications in the CORD-19 dataset for mainstream news media. Another additional characteristic is the recency of the publications being mentioned, particularly on Twitter and in news media, since about 75% of all mentions of publications relate to publications from 2020, while 57% of all mentions in mainstream news media also relate to 2020 publications.",

A topic modelling analysis showed that CORD-19 publications are related more broadly to medical research on viruses, of which COVID-19 and coronaviruses are part. Dominant topics in CORD-19 include research on public health and epidemics; molecular biology; coronaviruses, influenza and other families of viruses; immunology and antivirals; methodology (testing, diagnosing, trials). Furthermore, the topic intensity over time is far from uniform, showing in particular that coronavirus research has followed known outbreaks (SARS, MERS, and that until 2020 this research represented only a small portion of CORD-19.",

Molecular biology research on viruses is, in general, a very prominent component of Lastly, we considered Altmetric data, in order to gauge how much attention CORD-19 research attracted over time.

Delimiting research on a certain subject matter requires difficult choices that inevitably involve a certain degree of arbitrariness. We praise the breadth and relative coherence of CORD-19. This dataset rightly merits attention and is useful to allow many researchers to engage with the topic. Nevertheless, we also suggest that critical awareness is required when using CORD-19, as our results demonstrate that its contents cover a broad set of topics. Different subsets of CORD-19 should be used for specific purposes, for example for making historical 17 . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

We exemplified some approaches to segment CORD-19 in various ways. In addition, we also hinted at possible missing content in CORD-19. Some missing content is 'by design', as CORD-19 relies on PubMed, bioRxiv and medRxiv and does not consider, for example, notable pre-print servers such as arXiv, ChemRxiv, JMIR Preprints, SSRN Electronic Journal, Research Square and PsyArXiv. Some missing content is less clearly motivated, as the use of the same search criteria in WoS allowed us to surface published research not currently included in CORD-19. This is an issue that deserves deeper scrutiny.",

Firstly, there seems to be a need for a comprehensive mapping of COVID-19-related research. A multidisciplinary map of COVID-19-related research, considering diverse disciplinary perspectives and information needs, will be useful to surface relevant research, also outside the biomedical domain. Secondly, CORD-19 provides a virtuous example of open data sharing. The scientometric community can contribute by creating and maintaining additional datasets on COVID-19 research. Thirdly, as shown by our results, there is a lot of social media attention for COVID-19 research. Indeed, the role of information, and especially reliable scientific information, has been central to the unfolding of the current pandemic [33] . Consequently, a relevant area for future work is to better understand the mechanics of online scientific information diffusion, using altmetrics and other data sources. This line of work has the potential to provide valuable information to experts and governments during the current and future pandemics.",
