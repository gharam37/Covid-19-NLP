We use a SEIR model that includes three different compartments of infection: those who can stay at home, those in regular hospital beds and those in need of ICU treatment. The model allows for a time varying transmission rate which we use to incorporate the measures introduced by the government over the period of one year. The model predicts that by mid July 2020, the city will reach the peak of the epidemic with a total of 22 526 prevalent ICUs needed and 84 816 regular hospital beds needed. By the end of May 2020, the number of patients that need ICUs will overpass the current capacity set at 2000 beds for ICU hospital beds in the city. The model predicts that the death toll by the same date will reach 1752 people and the number of cases will be 54652 inhabitants by then.

It arrived to Colombia on March 6, 2020 from an imported case and evolved to local cases of transmission. In order to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak 10 in Bogot\u00e1, the largest city in Colombia, a local lock-down was introduced on March 15, 2020, followed by a national lock-down on March 19, 2020. Colombia, like many developing nations, does not have a strong health system able to respond to a pandemic of the magnitude of the present one. Neither in terms of infrastructure, medical personnel nor in terms of logistic preparedness or 15 technical capacities to arrange all medical needed resources. The latter is the main motivation to create a model that allows particular clinics and hospitals to estimate the number of beds in the respirators needed to attend during the peak days. Specifically, we are interested in estimating the number of patients that require Intensive Care Units-ICU care (critical), and the number of patients 20 that require hospital care (severe), but not ICU care.",

Additionally, on March 26 one of the two available machines used to run the detection tests broke, leading to a reduction on its production and causing delays in the total number of cases detected. One of the biggest concerns is that the data may 30 not inform well how many hospital beds (and ICU beds) will be needed during the outbreak peak. In fact, one of the main caveats for this study is that the official data is very likely to be under estimated as only patients with at least one symptom or that have had contact with another detected case have been tested [1]. Moreover, we are assuming an overall probability of requiring ICU 35 treatment, while sex, age and co-morbidity (diabetes, hypertension, acute respiratory diseases and depressed immune system) will highly determine differential probabilities, that we are not taken into account.",

During the outbreak some clinics should be ready to see an increase in their market share because they may have more resources, such as ICU beds and the model allows for each clinic to adjust it.

Each transition holds a rate based on what is observed from a population, that is a susceptible person gets 70 infected at a transmission rate once in contact with an infected individual, and become exposed. Once exposed transition to infected happens at a rate that captures the inverse of the mean latent period of the disease. The final transition is recovery with permanent immunity. We chose this model to estimate bed demands per institution in Colombia separating regular and ICU (Intensive 75 Care Units) beds, which allows a distinction for each type that reflects differential transition rates, preparedness and logistics for health providers.

These transitions and considerations are summarized in figure 1. We also assume that only patients in ICU die, while other infected patients recover.

Additionally,figure ?? shows those infected that will need hospital care, compared to the current number of ICU beds in the city. It shows that the number of ICUs needed will be 22541, i.e. the city has to increase its capacity by 11 times the current amount planned in order to provide care to everyone that needs it. The local authorities in Bogot\u00e1 are 140 planning to have a total of 2000 ICU beds in the city, but the current number is 300. The number 2000 is overrun by mid May/2020, with a death toll of 351 people by then. Unfortunately, the trend keeps on increasing for the following months, which reflects the lack of preparedness for a catastrophe like the current one in Bogot\u00e1 and likely in other similar developing nations.145When we double the number of days of ICU patients to recover in the model, i.e 1/\u03b3 U = 14 days, rather than 7, the number of ICU beds almost double in size. Moreover, if the probability of being an ICU patient p U is reduce, the number of beds is reduced, but even an small increase in this probability will cause a large increase in the number of ICU beds needed during the peak of the 150 epidemic.

With a mean incubation period of 5.2 days and mean infection period of 4 days (for patients at home), 5 days (for patients in regular hospital 160 beds) and 7 days (for patients in ICU). The parameters assumed in the model are for a positive scenario, where the effective reproduction number during the lock-down is assumed to be 1.5, and 2 after the lock-down, when other measures are introduced. We assume that 2.6% of patients require ICU treatment, 13.4% require regular hospital beds, and the rest only require home care. The model 165 allows for a time varying transmission rate which we use to incorporate the measures introduced by the government over the period of 1 year. The model predicts that by mid July, 2020, the city will reach the peak of the epidemic with a total of 22 541 active ICU prevalent cases and 85 015 regular hospital beds needed. 170 By the end of May 2020, the number of patients that need hospitalization will overpass the current planned capacity set at 2000 beds for ICU beds in the city, and the death toll will reach a total of 1752. Unpreparedness of the health system will only increase COVID-19 related and unrelated mortality, as already observed in Italy and other countries. Measures like lock-down have been used 175 in most countries to diffuse the demand for health services due to COVID-19 over time, however it may be insufficient if there are not enough resources to amp the health services in developing nations, such is the case of Colombia, where the need of additional resources are a priority at this point.",
