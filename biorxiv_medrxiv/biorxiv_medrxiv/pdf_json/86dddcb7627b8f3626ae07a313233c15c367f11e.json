SARS-CoV E protein is abundant in infected cells and plays a crucial role in viral particle assembly. Moreover, the E proteins of SARS coronaviruses likely have important roles in pathogenesis by manipulating a number of cellular processes. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 E protein could also be a critical virulence factor. Ectopic expression of SARS-CoV E was reported to trigger apoptotic cell death of T lymphocytes, which could potentially contribute to the lymphopenia observed in fatal cases, though a causal association is unproven. A potential mechanism for inducing apoptosis was reported to involve an interaction between a putative Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-like motif in SARS-CoV E and the antiapoptotic host protein Bcl-xL. Here we provide the first computational evidence indicating that both the SARS-CoV E and SARS-CoV-2 E have a C-terminal BH3-like motif. We used available sequence data for SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses combined with structural information to evaluate the structure to biological activity relationships of the SARS-CoV-2 E BH3-like motif. Our analysis reveals a predicted interactome for E that is extensively wired to the Bcl-2 apoptotic switch that could potentially be a therapeutic target. Last, network reconstruction identified both the BH3-binding protein Bcl-xL and the autophagy effector Beclin 1, another BH3-containing protein, as vulnerable nodes in the host cellular defense system against SARS-CoV-2.",

This protein is abundant in infected cells where it plays a crucial role in virus particle assembly, and appears to have multiple effects on membranes (12) (13) (14) . Compared to wild-type controls, recombinant coronaviruses lacking the E gene have significantly lower viral titers and reduced virus maturation and propagation (15) (16) (17) . E-deficient SARS-CoV is also severely attenuated in vivo, exhibiting diminished pathogenic effects (7, 18) and inability to replicate in the central nervous system (7), suggesting that the E protein may act as an important virulence factor in coronaviruses.",

Like many other SLiMs, the PBM found in SARS-CoV E is present at the C-terminus within an intrinsically disordered region (20) . Through its PBM, SARS-CoV E was shown to engage in interactions with the globular PDZ domains of multiple host proteins such as syntenin and PALS1, and these latter interactions may contribute to airway inflammation and permeability of the lung epithelial barrier (18, 19) . Several interesting host proteins were recently reported to bind the E protein of COVID-19 virus SARS-CoV-2 using mass-spec pull-down, including bromodomain proteins involved in immune responses and targeted by other viruses (21) .",

Although this finding contrasts with in vivo studies of the avirulent E-deficient SARS-CoV, a unifying hypothesis would be if SARS-CoV E suppresses host cell stress responses, as suggested, leading to increased cell death and suppression of beneficial immune responses (14). Alternatively, E could activate a harmful overzealous immune response. However, follow-up studies are needed, as each of these molecular interactions is supported primarily by a single report.",

BH3 motifs were described or predicted in proteins from eukaryotes (primarily mammals) and from several unrelated microbial species: DNA viruses (HHV8, HBV, HCV), RNA viruses (e..g. Newcastle disease virus) and bacteria (Photorhabdus luminescens). The evolution of BH3 motifs appears to involve processes of divergent evolution, transfer events and random/convergent evolution (24) , including possibly through viral mimicry as previously suggested for other SLiMs (27, 28) . Elaborating on previous works (24, 29) , we provide here the first observation that the C-terminal region of SARS-CoV-2 E also possesses this BH3-like sequence. While great attention has been paid to the role of BH3 motifs in cancer (30) (31) (32) , research efforts are warranted to determine biological, clinical and therapeutic relevance of modulating CoV E BH3-like motifs and their associated PPI networks in the context of coronavirus pathogenesis. The prophylactic interest of using SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with an E protein harboring a mutated or deleted BH3-like motif can now also be explored.",

CoV E protein sequences were found in all clades but with various levels of similarity in the C-terminal domain where the BH3-like motif occurs (Fig. 3) . Based on the amino acid sequences of the BH3-like region, we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships between the CoV E proteins from the new SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses derived from various species (Fig. 4) . CoV E sequences from gammacoronavirus rooted the phylogenetic tree, which provides evidence that their BH3-like region is more distantly related to the reference ZJ01 sequence than the homologous region from alpha-and deltacoronaviruses. Deltacoronavirus sequences were found to be more akin to sequences from betacoronaviruses than alphacoronavirus sequences.

In both the experimental structure for SARS-CoV E (Fig. 5A ) and the derived structural model for SARS-CoV-2 E (Fig. 5B) , the position of Leu51 is in a loop between two helices whereas the highly conserved Pro54 residue is located at the beginning of the C-terminal \u03b1-helix. Thus, despite a proline at this position, the BH3-like motif of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 E has intrinsic propensity for helix formation, like classical BH3s. Note that only four positions are different between full-length SARS-CoV E and SARS-CoV-2 E: two within the BH3-like helix (Thr55 and Val56 in SARS-CoV E, Ser55 and Phe56 in SARS-CoV-2) and two in a site immediately N-terminal to the PBM (where a pair of residues formed by Glu69 and Gly70 in SARS-CoV E is found instead of a single Arg69 residue in SARS-CoV-2 E). Except for Tyr57 (which contacts Leu28 located in the TM segment of the following chain), the BH3-like region (in red) appears to be only marginally involved in the inter-chain interactions needed to form the protein homopentamer (11), implying alternative roles for the BH3-like motif. Rather, the external orientation, and extended (i.e. irregular) structure of the BH3-like regions in the homopentamer (35) makes the CoV E BH3-like segment highly prone to serve as a small binding interface able to engage in transient interactions with protein partners, consistent with being a SLiM (24) . It is possible that the loop containing Leu51 may adopt a regular secondary structure upon binding to targets to form an extended \u03b1-helix, with the conserved Pro54 inducing formation of a kinked \u03c0-helix. author/funder.

Interestingly, although apoptosis of SARS-CoV-2-infected T cells has not yet been established (44), lymphocytopenia seems to be a common feature of COVID-19 patients (45) . In contrast, cells infected by a coronavirus lacking E (SARS-CoV\u0394E) were more primed for apoptosis than those infected with the wt strain (43) .

It may well be that CoV E activity could protect cells from cell death at early stages post-infection by regulating the UPR, and induce apoptosis at a later stage via Bcl-xL sequestration at the Golgi (8) or through its viroporin activity (10, 11) . Yang et al. (8) demonstrated that the interaction of SARS-CoV E with Bcl-xL is mediated by the BH3-like region of SARS-CoV E and the BH3 motif of Bcl-xL. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins normally accommodate the BH3 motif from typical BH3-only proteins in a hydrophobic receptor cleft partly formed by their own BH3 region (29) (30) (31) (32) . Hence, it remains to be determined whether SARS-CoV-2 E BH3 can bind in the hydrophobic groove of Bcl-xL or at another, distinct interface. It might also be interesting to assess the ability of BH3-mimetics like ABT-737, which tightly binds to the hydrophobic BH3-binding groove of Bcl-xL (47) , to inhibit binding of SARS-CoV-2 E to Bcl-xL. Bcl-xL and other family members also has other functions involving mitochondria and energetics that could be the targets of viral proteins (48, 49) .",

Beclin 1 (also known as autophagy-related protein Atg6 or Vps30) is a component of the lipid kinase (PIK3C2/VPS34) complex important for autophagosome formation. Beclin 1 appears to coordinate apoptosis versus autophagy depending on its interacting partners. The BH3 of Beclin 1 interacts with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, which limits autophagy under basal conditions (50, 51) . To initiate autophagy following stress, the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL -Beclin 1 interaction is disrupted (52, 53) .

The SARS-CoV E protein has been reported to interact with the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bcl-xL through a BH3-like motif located in its C-terminal portion. Considering the importance of Bcl-2 homologs and BH3containing proteins in pathophysiological settings, the relevance of this interaction and its extrapolation from SARS-CoV to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 may be revealing about the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In particular, detailed structural characterization and the identification of small molecule drugs able to disrupt this interaction could therefore provide a targeted therapeutic approach where coronavirus treatments are currently lacking or reliant on convalescent sera (62) . Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 deleted or mutated in the BH3-like region of E might also prove valuable for the design of a live, attenuated vaccine, with an E protein sufficiently intact to maintain structural integrity necessary for the virus life cycle, but mutated enough to abolish protein-protein interactions involved in viral pathogenicity. Last, PPI network reconstruction predicted that both the BH3-binding protein Bcl-xL and the BH3-bearing protein Beclin 1 might be (respectively directly and indirectly) targeted by SARS-CoV-2 to its own advantage, i.e., for interference with antiviral innate immune pathways.",

SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious pathogen that rapidly spread around the world causing the worst pandemic in the past 100 years. SARS-CoV-2 shares high sequence homology with SARS-CoV and causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), leading to pneumonia and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although probably not as lethal as SARS-CoV, its robust transmissibility by asymptomatic individuals is an important contributor to the pandemic.",

In addition to shortening the transmembrane domain, which may affect subcellular localization (e.g. by enhancing retention in the Golgi (38)), this deletion could potentially interfere with the binding properties of the SARS-CoV-2 E BH3-like motif by introducing local conformational rearrangements.Last, our analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 interactome using the VirHostNet 2.0 interology webservice (39)(Fig. 6) revealed that the predicted SARS-CoV-2 network appears to be wired to the Bcl-2 apoptotic switch by the nonstructural protein NS7a and by protein E.Interestingly, in this interactome, NS7a contacts the five major anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (Bcl-xL/BCL2L1, BCL2, BCL-w/BCL2L2, MCL-1 and Bfl-1/BCL2A1) (40), suggesting that this protein might act as a universal modulator of prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins during infection. Because many viruses have evolved strategies to interfere with apoptosis (41), experimental evidence is needed to establish if the E protein from SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly targets prosurvival Bcl-2 homologs to modulate cell viability.",
