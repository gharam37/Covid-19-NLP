            "text": "human population remains mysterious, although bat and pangolin were proposed to be 27 the natural reservoirs. Strikingly, comparing to the SARS-CoV-2-like CoVs identified in 28 bats and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 harbors a polybasic furin cleavage site in its spike (S) 29 glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as its receptor to infect cells. Receptor 30 recognition by the S protein is the major determinant of host range, tissue tropism, and 31 pathogenesis of coronaviruses. In an effort to search for the potential intermediate or 32 amplifying animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2, we examined receptor activity of ACE2 from 33 14 mammal species and found that ACE2 from multiple species can support the 34 infectious entry of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the wild-type or furin cleavage 35 site deficient S protein of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 of human/rhesus monkey and rat/mouse 36 exhibited the highest and lowest receptor activity, respectively. Among the remaining 37 species, ACE2 from rabbit and pangolin strongly bound to the S1 subunit of 38 SARS-CoV-2 S protein and efficiently supported the pseudotyped virus infection. These wild animal market in Wuhan city would otherwise be a unique place to trace any 73 potential animal source; however, soon after the disease outbreak, the market was 74 closed and all the wild animals were cleared, making this task very challenging or even 75 impossible. As an alternative, wide screening of wild animals becomes imperative. 76 Several recent studies identified multiple SARS-COV-2-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) from 77 smuggled Malayan pangolins in China. These pangolin CoVs (PCoV) form two 78 phylogenetic lineages, PCoV-GX and PCoV-GD 8-11 . In particular, lineage PCoV-GD 79 was found to carry a nearly identical receptor-binding motif (RBM) in the spike (S) 80 protein to that of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.1) . However, the genome of these pangolin Receptor recognition by the viral S protein is the major determinant of host range, 89 cell, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis of coronaviruses 14 . The S protein of 90 SARS-CoV-2 is a type I membrane glycoprotein, which can be cleaved to S1 and S2 91 subunit during biogenesis at the polybasic furin cleavage site (RRAR) (Fig.1) multiple animal ACE2 could serve as receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 116 mutant. ACE2 of human/rhesus monkey and rat/mouse exhibited the highest and lowest 117 receptor activity, respectively, with the other 10 ACE2s exhibiting intermediate activity. 118 The implications of our findings were discussed in terms of the natural reservoir, 119 zoonotic transmission, human-to-animal transmission, animal health, and animal model. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.19.048710 doi: bioRxiv preprint 7 confirm that hACE2 is the bone fide entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. 10 animal ACE2s were between human/monkey and rat/mouse. Among these, ACE2 of 154 canine, feline, rabbit and pangolin could support virus entry at levels >50% of hACE2. 155 To examine receptor binding ability, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) 156 analysis by using both S1 and receptor binding domain (RBD) as probe. Among the 14 157 different ACE2s tested, ACE2 from human, monkey, feline, rabbit and pangolin 158 exhibited significant and consistent association with S1 and RBD (Fig.3C) . Importantly, 159 these ACE2s correspond to the group of ACE2s that supported the most efficient virus 160 entry (Fig.3B ).",

Here, 163 we generated a SARS-CoV-2 S gene mutant with the furin cleavage site deleted to (Fig.3B ). 172 We also tested the receptor usage of these 14 ACE2 by SARS-CoV (Fig.3D ). The To help understand the molecular basis of different ACE2 receptor activities, we 181 first examined the overall sequence variation between these ACE2s. For this purpose, 182 we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequences of ACE2s (Fig.4) . 183 Interestingly, the phylogenetic clustering of ACE2s is correlated with their abilities to 184 .

For example, ACE2s in subclade IIA (human, rhesus 185 monkey and rabbit) and IIB (rat and mouse) were the most efficient and poorest receptor, 186 respectively, while ACE2s in clade I (from the remaining animals) were intermediate 187 between subclades IIA and IIB.

The D30N, 210 Y83F and K353H substitutions are all predicted to disrupt these interactions in rat and 211 mouse ACE2 ( Figure 6 ). This is consistent with previous reports which pinpoint K353 212 as an important hotspot for both SARS-CoV-2 16 and SARS-CoV 33 binding. It has been 213 experimentally demonstrated that introduction of K353H into hACE2 significantly 214 reduces binding to SARS-CoV S1; in contrast, introduction of H353K into rat ACE2 215 significantly increases binding to SARS-CoV S1 34 Table S1 ). 220 Both Bat ACE2s are also inefficient receptors for viral entry (Fig.3B ). Since the 221 profile of residues at the receptor/RBD interface is significantly different from rat and 222 mouse ACE2, we examined other bat-specific residue substitutions that may be 223 contributing to receptor dysfunction. There are 8 and 10 critical residue substitutions in 224 the Rs bat and Tb bat ACE2s, respectively (Fig.5 ). Among these, we examined the 225 substitutions at positions Y41, H34 and E329 as they are only seen in bat ACE2s. The 226 Y41H substitution in both bat ACE2s appears to be disrupting the same H-bond network 227 that was disrupted by K353H in rat and mouse ACE2. Although Y41 is not as centrally 228 located in the H-bond network as K353, it directly contacts N501 from the RBD, which is 229 the same residue that is stabilized by K353.

In humans, H34 forms a H-bond 231 with Y453 from the RBD, which is broken through a H34T substitution in bat ACE2s. 232 Finally, the bat-unique substitution E329N appears to be disrupting H-bonds connecting 233 two ACE2 residues (E329, Q325) and two RBD residues (N439, Q506). In Tb bat ACE2, 234 all connections in the H-bond network are disrupted by the single E329N substitution, 235 however the H-bond network is predicted to be restored by an additional substitution, 236 Q325E in Rs bat. In addition, other residue substitutions, i.e. T27M and M82N in Rs bat, 237 and D30Q and L79H in Tb bat, are also disruptive (Fig. 6) . 238 These results reveal that the poor and low receptor activity of rodent ACEs and bat 239 ACE2 are resulted from a broken interaction network by a key residue substitution, i.e. 240 K353H in rodents and Y41H in bats, and additive disruptive effects by multiple residue 241 substitutions.",

The 244 results suggested that wild type and mutant SARS-CoV-2 lacking the furin cleavage site 245 in S protein could use ACE2 from a broad range of animal species to enter host cells. 246 Below we discuss the implication of our findings in terms of natural reservoir, zoonotic 247 transmission, human-to-animal transmission, animal health, and animal model.

Although these data were obtained by using HIV1-based 253 pseudotyped virus, for ACE2 of Rs bat, civet, and mouse, the data is consistent with in 254 vitro infection data using infectious virus 3 . Receptor usage by coronaviruses has been 255 well known to be a major determinant of host range, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis 256 14,35,36 . It is therefore reasonable to assume that SARS-CoV-2 would be able to infect all 257 these animals. As a matter of fact, several in vivo infection and seroconversion studies 258 have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 can infect rhesus monkey 37 , feline, ferret, and canine As described above, it seems that dogs are not as susceptible as cats to 315 SARS-CoV-2 38,45 . Interestingly, this is in agreement with results from IP analysis that 316 showed cat ACE2 could bind to S1 or RBD more efficiently than dog ACE2 (Fig.3C) . 317 Structural models further suggest that, at those critical RBD-binding residues, dog and 318 cat ACE2 share 4 substitutions (Q24L, D30E, D38E, and M82T), while dog ACE2 has 319 an additional substitution, H34Y (Fig.5) . Based on structural modeling, both Q24L and 320 M82T are predicted to be disruptive, while both D30E and D38E are tolerable (Table   321   . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

H34Y in dog ACE2 is predicted to disrupt the hydrogen bond with Y453 of RBD 322 (Table S1 ). These atomic interactions explain why dog ACE2 binds to S1 or RBD less 323 efficiently compared to cat ACE2, and both are less efficient than human ACE2. 324 In addition to cat and dog, rabbits are also often raised as household pets. Our 325 results indicate that rabbit ACE2 is an efficient receptor ( Fig. 3B and 3C) , suggesting 326 that rabbit may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than cat. 327 Currently, there is no evidence that infected pets can transmit the virus back to 328 human; however, this may be possible and should be investigated. Out of an abundance 329 of caution it would be best when one is infected to have both human and pets 330 quarantined, and the pets tested as well. for SARS-CoV-2 as mouse ACE2 still supports some entry for SARS-CoV (Fig.3D) , 349 but not SARS-CoV-2. An alternative way to make a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain 350 could be achieved by rational design of the S gene. Based on the structural model, we 351 know that receptor dysfunction of mouse ACE2 is due to disruptive D30N, L79T, M82S, 352 Y83F, E329A and K353H substitutions (Fig.5, Fig.6 and Table S1 ). Therefore, by 353 specifically introducing mutations into the RBM of S gene it may be possible to restore 354 or at least partly restore interactions with these ACE2 substitutions. Consequently, the 355 engineered virus may be able to efficiently infect wildtype mice. 356 To date, several animals (i.e. rhesus monkey, ferret, dog, cat, pig, chicken and duck) 357 have been examined as potential animal models for SARS-CoV-2 37,38 . Although the 358 rhesus monkey, ferret and cat may seem to be the promising candidates, none of them 359 are perfect in terms of recapitulation of typical clinical features in COVID-19 patients. 360 Therefore, multiple animal models may be needed. Our results indicate that rabbit 361 ACE2 is a more efficient receptors than other animal ACE2s for both SARS-CoV-2 and 362 SARS-CoV (Fig.3) . Therefore, it may be worthy assessing rabbit as a useful animal 363 model for further studies.

The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused CoV-2 and its emergence in the human population remain mysterious. Many of 56 the early cases were linked to the Huanan seafood and wild animal market in Wuhan 57 city, raising the possibility of zoonotic origin 4 . Sequencing analyses showed that the 58 genome of SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.5%, 89.1%, 93.3%, and 96.2% nucleotide sequence 59 identity with that of human SARS-CoV, bat coronavirus (CoV) ZC45, bat CoV 60 RmYN02, and bat CoV RaTG13, respectively, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 probably 61 has bat origins 2,3,5 . This finding is not surprising as bats are notorious for serving as the 62 natural reservoir for many emerging zoonotic viral pathogens, including two other 63 deadly human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome 64 coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused global outbreak during 2002-",

As shown in Fig.3D, ACE2 of rhesus monkey, mouse, civet, ferret badger, 262 raccoon and feline could support SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus entry; concordantly, all 263 these animals are susceptible to native SARS-CoV virus infection 12,40-43 . 264 Among all those wild animals that are potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2, bat 265 and pangolin have already been proposed to be the natural reservoirs as closely related 266 SL-CoVs have been identified in bats 2,3,5 and pangolins 8-11 . A recent study has shown 267 that bat SL-CoV RaTG13 could use hACE2 as receptor, consistent with the presence of 268 several favorable hACE2-binding residues (aa 455, 482-486) in the receptor binding 269 motif (RBM) of the S protein (Fig.1) 16 . For pangolin SL-CoVs, lineage PCoV-GD has 270 only one non-critical amino acid substitution (Q483H) in the RBM when compared to 271 SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.1) 10 . Therefore, PCoV-GD most likely can also use hACE2 and 272 other animal ACE2s as functional receptors. 273 We also tested the receptor usage by a SARS-CoV-2 mutant that lacks the furin 274 cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary. Our result showed that the mutant virus of furin cleavage during coronavirus infection. Furin cleavage is not essential 279 for coronavirus-cell membrane fusion, but enhances cell-to-cell fusion 18-21,44 . This 280 could provide certain level of advantage during infection. For example, in the 281 quasispecies population of bovine CoV, a minor sequence variant with a polybasic 282 furin-like cleavage site in the S2 subunit quickly dominated the population even after a 283 single passage in cells 23 . However, by using pseudotyped virus system, which is a 284 single cycle infection system, we may not see the advantage. Still, ours result 285 unequivocally showed that SARS-CoV-2 without this cleavage site could use multiple 286 animal ACE2s as receptors to enter cells. As there is a need to continuously search for 287 potential intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV, results presented here can help significantly 288 narrow down the scope of potential targets. 289 Collectively, our results highlight the potential of these wild animals to serve as 290 natural reservoirs or intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 and its progenitor, the risk of 291 zoonotic transmission of animal SL-CoVs to human, and the necessity of virus 292 surveillance in wild animals. 293 Implication in human-to-animal transmission and animal health 294 Among those animal species tested here, canine and feline are of special concern as 295 they are often raised as companion pets. Our data indicate that ACE2 of canine and 296 feline could support SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus entry quite efficiently (>50% of 297 hACE2, Fig.3B), raising the alarming possibility of virus transmission from only three nucleotide changes compared to the virus isolated from two infected 302 persons living in the same household, suggesting that this dog probably acquired the 303 virus from the infected owners 45 . Our results are further supported by two additional 304 studies. One study showed that both dog and cat were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 305 infection. While the virus replicated poorly in dogs, it replicated efficiently in cats and 306 was able to transmit to unaffected cats that were housed with them 38 . The other study 307 revealed that 14.7% of cat sera samples collected in Wuhan city after the outbreak were 308 positive for antibody against SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that many cats were infected 309 during the outbreak, most likely from infected humans in close contact 39 . Domestic cats 310 are also susceptible to SARS-CoV infection 40 and human-to-cat transmission was 311 evident during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003 in Hong Kong 46 . These findings were 312 also in agreement with our results that ACE2 of cat and dog could serve as receptor for 313 SARS-CoV (Fig.3D).314",
