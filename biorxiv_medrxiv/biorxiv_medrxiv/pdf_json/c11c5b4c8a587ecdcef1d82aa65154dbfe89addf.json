            "text": "medRxiv preprint Predictions on the time-evolution of the number of severe and critical cases of COVID-19 patients in Guadeloupe are presented. A stochastic model is purposely developed to explicitly account for the entire population ( 400000 inhabitants) of Guadeloupe. The available data for Guadeloupe are analysed and combined with general characteristics of the COVID-19 to constrain the parameters of the model. The time-evolution of the number of cases follows the well-known exponential-like model observed at the very beginning of a pandemic outbreak. The exponential growth of the number of infected individuals is controlled by the so-called basic reproductive number, R 0 , defined as the likely number of additional cases generated by a single infectious case during its infectious period T I . Because of the rather long duration of infectious period ( 14 days) a high rate of contamination is sustained during several weeks after the beginning of the containment period. This may constitute a source of discouragement for people restrained to respect strict containment rules. It is then unlikely that, during the containment period, R 0 falls to zero. Fortunately, our models shows that the containment effects are not much sensitive to the exact value of R 0 provided we have R 0 < 0.6. For such conditions, we show that the number of severe and critical cases is highly tempered about 4 to 6 weeks after the beginning of the containment. Also, the maximum number of critical cases (i.e. the cases that may exceed the hospital's intensive care capacity) remains near 30 when R 0 < 0.6. For a larger R 0 = 0.8 a slower decrease of the number of critical cases occurs, leading to a larger number of deceased patients. This last example illustrates the great importance to maintain an as low as possible R 0 during and after the containment period. The rather long delay between the beginning of the containment and the appearance of the slowing-down of the rate of contamination puts a particular strength on the communication and sanitary education of people. To be mostly efficient, this communication must be done by a locally recognised medical staff. We believe that this point is a crucial matter of success.

            "text": "The most recent evolution of the pandemic COVID-19 disease in Western Europe indicates that this region is, together with the United States, the new centre of the pandemic spread (e.g. (1) and other reports issued by the World Health Organization). Italy and Spain are confronted with large outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In France, the rate of new infections daily increases and measures have already been taken to increase the intensive care capacity of the main hospitals of the country. Also, in order to face with the strong heterogeneity of case number among the different regions in France, medevacs (either by air or railway) have been undertaken to optimally redistribute the most critical patients in the country's intensive care facilities. In this context, the situation of remote French territories like Guadeloupe is particularly critical since, although possible, medevacs should be anticipated with a longer delay because of the distance and the duration of the travels. Numerical models of the spread of epidemic diseases may be of some help to anticipate the evolution of the situation in a near-future of several weeks and, eventually, may reveal a likely disruption of the local intensive care capacity. In short, mathematical models may be ranked in two main categories, namely semi-analytical models and numerical stochastic and Monte Carlo models (see (2) for a review). In the former category, the spread of the disease is modelled by a set of coupled differential equations that account for the most important characteristics of the disease. This approach is largely followed (3) (4) (5) . The second category of models is, in some sense, more straightforward and relies on network models to explicitly considers the individuals constituting the population. Such an approach offers a great versatility to tackle with complicated features, like social interaction matrices, that are difficult to introduce in semi-analytical models. The main drawback of numerical stochastic models is their computer-intensive demand that, for large populations, necessitates the use of multi-scale or coarsegrained algorithms. Thanks to the moderate size of the population of Guadeloupe, no such difficulties are encountered and a straightforward approach is possible.",

            "text": "The technical details of the model are explained in the appendix Stochastic Monte Carlo model, and we here recall its main characteristics. A flowchart of the model is shown in Figure 1 . As stated above, all individuals forming the population are considered as nodes in a fully connected network where everyone is able to meat anyone. By using social contact matrices, this full connection could be modified to account for demographic and social heterogeneity. Also, we have not considered the age-dependence of the COVID-19 effects. Each individual of the network may, temporarily or definitely, be in the following state ( Fig. 1) : non-infected, infected with minor symptoms (\"infectious\"), infected with severe symptoms (\"severe\"), infected critical (\"critical\"), dead or recovered. In the vocabulary of epidemic modelling, non-infected correspond to the so-called \"Susceptibles\" and minor infected are \"Infectious\". In our model, both the severe and critical infected are not considered as infectious because they are isolated in hospital facilities and unable to significantly contaminate others. Although this is statistically justified in our model, actually this assumption is contradicted by the sad death of several French medics. According to the classical nomenclature, our model is a SIscRd model where the lowercase \"sc\" indicate the transient and non-contaminating nature of these states. To the best of our knowledge at the time of writing this paper, it does not seem that recovered \"R\" patients are able to again become infectious \"I\" (6). The deceased \"d\" patients may remain infectious several days (7) and we assume that they are safely isolated to prevent any contamination. 1 . Flowchart of the stochastic modelling procedure. In the general case, a susceptible non-infected person S1 becomes infected. This new infected I may contaminate a number R0 of other susceptibles (here S2 and S3) during his infected period T I (red line) which may run beyond the recovery period \u2206T I (in yellow). During the sub-period \u03b4Ts (shaded rectangle), the infectious \"I\" may switch to state \"severe\" with a probability ps. If the patient remains in state \"I\" until the end of the recovery period \u2206T I , he becomes definitively recovered \"R\". Instead, if the patient switches to state \"s\", he may either recover at the end of the recovery period \u2206Ts or switch with a probability pc to state critical \"c\" during the switching period \u03b4Tc. The same procedure applies to state critical \"c\".",

Both models 2 and 3 fit the data as well as model 1 excepted for the flattening part of the \u03a3N s data after day 21 (March 31). This indicates that the determination of R 0 during the containment is constrained only by the most recent data values. The quality and reliability of these data is then of a great importance to derive models able to predict an eventual decrease of critical cases. Model 2 (Fig. 3) corresponds to the containment R 0 = 0.6 and gives a maximum number of critical cases of the same order and at the same date as the one obtained with model 1 (Fig. 2) . However, the decrease following the maximum is less steep and low values are reached about 3 weeks later with respect to what is observed with model 1. This translates into a larger cumulative number of critical case and, consequently, in a larger number of deceased patients (compare Fig. 2E and Fig. 3E ). Model 3 (Fig. 4 ) corresponds to R 0 = 0.8. As can be verified in Figure 4A ,C, the flattening of the data after day 21 (March 31) is poorly reproduced making this model less likely than models 1 and 2. However, owing that the flattening of the \u03a3N s curve relies on a small part of the most recent data,this pessimistic model cannot be totally excluded at the time of writing this article. The maximum values of critical cases may reach a maximum of 30 critical patient followed by a plateau with a small slope during which the instantaneous number N c remains around 15-20 one month after the date of the maximum. This correspond to a situation where the treatment of numerous critical patients must be sustained during a long period, implying the disposal of a sufficiently large medical staff and amount of equipment. As can be observed in Figure 4E the number of deceased patients increases steadily.",

            "text": "A common characteristic to all 3 models presented above, is the need of a quite large number Z I = 80 of initial infectious persons coupled with a large R 0 4 at the beginning of the epidemic spread. This large Z I could be explained either by the importation of a large number of infected persons or the presence of several super contaminators able to contaminate tens of persons during meetings in a short period of time (see (13, 14) for the effects of mass gathering). Let us remark that large R 0 are reported by others; for instance, Tang et al. report values as high as 6.47 for data from China. These authors mention that this high R 0 corresponds to data collected during a period of intensive social contacts (i.e. before the Chinese New Year). Mizumoto and Chowell report R 0 values as high as 10 for the case of Diamond Princess, and for the same data Rockl\u00f6v et al. find a maximum R 0 = 14.8 and a 8-fold reduction to R 0 = 1.78 during isolation and quarantine. Another characteristic of the model is the need to significantly reduce R 0 to fit the decelerating curvature of the \u03a3N I data curve (e.g. Fig. 2A ). This reduction is delayed by about 3 days with respect to the beginning of the containment and confirms an overall good respect of the social distancing rules by the population of Guadeloupe. Several French national media published articles stating that Guadeloupe was relativity spared from the disease (18) . Such a claim could have triggered a common sense reflex of protection applied through social distancing and usage of rules of hygiene. To fit the most recent \u03a3N I data, a low R 0 = 0.35 must be applied. If true, this would indicate that people of Guadeloupe continued to improve their social behaviour during the 3 weeks after the beginning of the containment. The models allows to get an estimate of the number of instantaneous infectious N I and cumulative recovered patients \u03a3N R . In absence of systematic detection of COVID-19 among the population, no N I data are available and the N I curve is actually indirectly constrained by the fit to the \u03a3N s and N c data and by the switching probabilities p s and p c . However, the values given to these probabilities fall in ranges widely recognised by the medical community and we may safely consider them sufficiently reliable to give credit to the modelled N I and \u03a3N R curves. A simple assessment may be done by dividing \u03a3N d by the observed number of deceased patients. On day 28 (April 7), this ratio equals 0.7%, a value slightly lower than the generally recognised ratio of 1 \u2212 2% (19) . For the models discussed above, several thousands of persons have been infected and a large fraction of them have recovered and are supposed protected against another infection. However, these supposedly protected persons represent a relatively small part of the total population and the number of susceptible persons remains sufficiently large to ensure a restart of a second epidemic spread of the disease. This is shown in Figure 5 which represents a long-term simulation with model 1 as in Figure  2 but with an abrupt resetting of R 0 = 4.0 at day 70 (mid-May), about 2 months after the beginning of the containment. This corresponds to a situation of uncontrolled end of containment. Because of the existence of only several infectious cases, the spread of the virus proceed at a low-level during approximately 3 weeks (i.e. until day 90) before exponentially exploding again into a second epidemic crisis. These results illustrate the future difficulty to control such a restart of the virus propagation and the necessity to maintain a low R 0 for a long period of time. The simulation shown in Figure 5 assumes that the patient who recovered during the first epidemic crisis cannot be infected during the second crisis, a medical assumption that remains to be confirmed.",

In order to quantify the random fluctuations due to the stochastic nature of the model, each simulation is performed 20 times to compute the median and the confidence intervals of the results. The first simulation corresponds to a duration of 80 days with a basic reproduction number R 0 = 2.0 from day 1 to day 39, and R 0 = 1. Figure 6 shows the results of the simulation for the time variations of N I (Fig. 6B) , and of \u03a3N s and N s (Fig. 6C) . The three curves together with N c are represented in a common semi-logarithmic graph in Figure 6A . The Natural logarithm is used throughout the present paper. As a starting point for the discussion, it can first be observed that the time variations of N I and N s significantly depart from a pure exponential pattern, particularly because of the presence of smooth bumps in the curves around day 55. These bumps can be better understood in the semi-logarithmic plot of Figure 6A where the N I and N s curves appear partly linear in two segments. The same linear segments are also visible in the N c curve. The presence of linear segment in the curves indicates an exponential time variation. In the N I curve (orange symbols), a first linear segment goes from day 1 until day 39 with slope \u03b2 = 0.108. A second linear segment with slope \u03b2 = 0.035 starts at day 50.

In curve N I , the curved segment starts at day 40 when the change of R 0 occurs. However, because new infectious patients do not immediately contaminate others but instead do that during the period of time T I , an abrupt change of R 0 appears smoothed. Consequently, this is only after day 50, that a linear segment corresponding to the new value of R 0 appears in the N I curve. This phenomena is of a considerable practical importance because it represents a latency (or an inertia) of the control measures taken by the authorities to reduce and extinct the epidemic process. Such a latency has to be clearly explained to the population in order to encourage people to maintain they efforts to remain in containment.",

This duration of 9 days corresponds to the onset period of the N s curve during days 1 to 9 of the process (filled blue dots in Fig.  6A ). The delay of 9 days is caused by existence of the time period \u03b4T s = [ts 1 , ts 2 ] during which a \"I\" patient is able to become \"s\" (in this simulation, \u03b4T s runs from day 4 to day 10). Consequently, the first \"s\" patients begin to appear after a delay of ts 1 days (i.e. 4 days in this example) and all \"s\" patients are created at day t2 s 10. This explains the duration and the shape of the onset period visible at the beginning of the N s curve. Consequently, the onset period of the N s curve may provide information about the switch period \u03b4T s . The same onset phenomena is observed in the N c curve but with a delay equals to the sum of ts 1 + tc1 = 7 days. The end of the onset period falls at day ts 2 + tc 2 = 19.",

Contrarily to the instantaneous quantities N I and N s which give the number of either \"I\" or \"s\" patient at a given time, \u03a3N s is a cumulative quantity which gives the total number of patients who passed by stage \"s\" anytime before present. We emphasise that this quantity is NOT the integral of N s and, as a consequence, the slopes of the linear segments present in the \u03a3N s curve are not simply related to those of the N s curve. Indeed, a careful examination of the \u03a3N s reveals that the segments are not strictly linear. At the beginning of the process, we have \u03a3N s = N s until the end of the time periods where first \"s\" patients begin to switch either to the state \"R\" or \"c\". At that time, the two curves begin to diverge. The slopes of the linear segments in \u03a3N s are always slightly larger than the slopes of N s and the formula 2 and 3 are no more exact for the \u03a3N s case. Indeed, the R 0 values derived for \u03a3N s in the example (upper right part of Fig. 6 ) are significantly biased, and to obtain reliable R 0 estimates, it is necessary to use data at the very end of the process, in the narrow time-window comprised between the end of the onset period and the beginning of the switching from \"s\" to \"c\". The size of the confidence intervals appears constant in the semi-logarithmic plots (Fig. 6A ). This is typical of a multiplicative noise where the amplitude of the statistical fluctuations is proportional to the data amplitude as can be checked in Figure 6B ,D.",

Practically, this conducts to the appearance of some outlier simulations and justifies the use of the median. We now address another important characteristic of the epidemic process through the random variations occurring at the very beginning of the process. The features we want to discuss are illustrated in Figure 7 where the plots have been obtained by running the model with a different number on initial infected Z I . In the case of rather small values of Z I (i.e. 1, 10 or 20 in Fig. 7A ,B,C), random fluctuations perturb the beginning of the curves, with a longer persistence for the N s curve. For larger values of Z I (i.e. 40, 60 or 80 in Fig. 7D ,E,F), the random fluctuations almost disappear while the starting sequence becomes steeper. Consequently, a careful observation of the starting sequence may provide some information about the number Z I of initial infectious persons. Let us remark that these features can only be obtained with a stochastic model as the one developed in the present study. .

This section gives details on the method used for the data analysis and presents the results used to constrain the stochastic model presented in section Stochastic Monte Carlo model. Figure 8 shows the data used in the present study, namely the numbers N s and N c of severe and critical case observed in Guadeloupe from March 13 th until April 2 of year 2020. These data are presented in both linear and semi-logarithmic plots in order to better emphasise a possible exponential-like pattern. Because of the small number of data available at the time of writing the present paper, the exponential increase of either N s or N c is not as conspicuous as for the synthetic case presented in Figure 6 . However, for the data set N s , the semi-logarithmic plot (Fig. 8B) is reasonably linear in the [day 7 \u2212 day 16] period. The first 6 points are expected to correspond to the \u03b4T s onset period of 6 to 7 days. For the N c data, a linear segment may be identified in the [day 6 \u2212 day 19] period. By comparing the onset period in the data with the simulation results of Figure 7 , we may claim that the onset sequence of the data curve N s corresponds to a rather large number of at least 80 initial infectious persons. These persons could for instance be passengers of an aircraft or members of a group infected by a single infectious during a meeting.",

In the present study, we performed 1000 bootstrap resamplings for each data set N s and N c , and the so-obtained 1000 estimates of \u03b2 may be used to compute the probability density kernels shown in Figure 9A . The two probability distributions are poorly statistically coherent with a small overlap of the two curves.

To reproduce the flat almost horizontal end of the data from day 21 (March 31), it is necessary to reduce R 0 = 0.35 from day 19 (March 29) until the end of the process (i.e. day 80). With this model, the maximum N c = 25 \u00b1 3 is reached near day 28 (April 7) about 3 weeks after the beginning of the containment. After this date, the number of critical cases sharply decreases to reach a low base level about 4 weeks later, i.e. during the first week of May.To illustrate the role played by R 0 during the containment period, we present the results for 2 models with the same parameter values as for model 1 excepted during the containment.
