In this study, Greece is the main focus for assessing the national outbreak and estimating the general trends and outlook of it. Multiple data analytics procedures, spectral decomposition and curve-fitting formulations are developed based on the data available at hand. Standard SIEQRDP epidemic modelling is applied for Greece and for the general region around it, providing hints for the outbreak progression in the mid-and long-term, for various infections under-reporting rates. The overall short-term outlook for Greece seems to be towards positive, with a downward trend in infections rate daily increase (i.e., now beyond the exponential growth rate), a possible peak within a few days beyond April 14th, as well as the high availability level of ICU w.r.t. expected demand at peak. On the negative side, the fade-out period seems to be in the order of several months, with high probability of recurrent surges of the outbreak. The mitigation policies for the 'next day' should be focused on close tracking of the epidemic via large-scale tests, strict border checking in international travelling and an adaptive plan for selective activation of mitigation measures when deemed necessary.",

The next day WHO confirmed human-to-human transmission of the virus, unofficially tagged as '2019-nCoV' at that moment, while China was already reporting 580 confirmed cases.

He also added that in some countries the doubling period is 'three to four days' and that this virus 'accelerates very fast it decelerates much more slowly'. * V. Wood, 'Coronavirus 10 times more deadly than swine flu, says WHO', The Independent (UK), 14-Apr-2020. A first estimation places its fatality rate in China (early outbreak) at least above 3.4% of confirmed cases; however, post-analysis with extensive cases analysis, as well as results from countries with a very large rate of randomized tests (including South Korea, Iceland, Germany) lower the actual fatality rate to 1% or less (see: Figure 7 ). Taking into account the epidemic data from several countries within this first threemonth window, Figure 8 shows the real range of the fatality rate, ranging from 0.25% to 10% or more, depending on the circumstances and phase of the epidemic.",

Phases 1-3 are mostly 'dormant', when the virus is mutated and begins to transmit form animals to humans, but remained undetected until the number of infections becomes significant. In phase 4 the virus is spreading freely in human populations, with the authorities not yet knowing how/where to address it and not yet having strict measures in effect to mitigate it. During this phase, the infections increase at a high exponential rate and a large portion of them is usually undetected and, thus, under-reported. Phase 5 may be split into two sub-phases: the first (phase 5a) begins at the moment the quarantine measures are in effect and start to gradually slow down the exponential growth to a peak (maximum number of active infections); the second (phase 5b) begins at the peak and continues to the point when the active infections decrease and the evolution is becoming a curve that asymptotically approaches zero. Then, phase 6 is the period of this asymptotically decreasing active infections, where usually the quarantine measures are gradually deactivated; this is the phase when most recurrent events occur, as some still-infected and unregistered cases can move freely again in the general population. Without prompt and effective vaccination procedures and large-scale tests in place for the general population, these events are almost certain to happen with flu-like viruses. After any such recurrent events fade out, the final phase is in effect and the virus spread can be tracked on a seasonal level, taking into account natural immunization (recovered patients) and vaccination that make a new large-scale outbreak very unlikely.",

On the other hand, slowing down the infection rate results in much longer 'tails' in phase 6, i.e., a similarly slower rate of the asymptotically fading-out of the outbreak. Additionally, If no vaccination is available in phase 6, any deactivation of the quarantine measures re-exposes the general population to undetected infections and the probability of a recurrent outbreak becomes higher. In other words, the more 'flat' the curve is at the peak of the outbreak, the longer is the fade-out period is and with higher possibility of another outbreak. Additionally, since the infection-to-recovery cycle usually produces natural immunization (depending on the virus type), having a 'flat' curve also translates to lower levels of natural protection for the general public and usually stronger subsequent waves of the same outbreak. Figure In the end, if the complete wipe-out of the virus cannot be guaranteed in the long term, the only stable outcome is when the general population has been immunized, naturally (infected/recovered) or artificially (vaccination), at a minimum proportion usually much higher that 60-70%, depending on the type of the virus -but still, 100% is not required, due to the 'herd immunity' phenomenon (1, 2) . Hence, 'flattening the curve' is a measure of securing more time for the health system to cope with the highest infection rate or 'peak' and for the community to improve intermediate treatments and",

Their common characteristic is the base assumption of having a target population partitioned in compartments that are homogeneous in all relevant properties (e.g., sex, age, underlying pathologies, etc) and there are direct interactions between them. The three basic compartments are S='susceptible', I='infectious' and R='recovered', assuming insignificant rate of deaths and permanent immunity after recovery. Variants of this SIR base model include a D='deaths' compartment (SIRD), E='exposed' compartment (SEIR, SEIRD) for introducing an incubation period, Q='quarantined' compartment (SEIQRD, SEIQRDP) for separating the already isolated confirmed/possible carriers, etc. The SIR-like models, along with more recent SEIR-like variants, are still used as the baseline for comparing other approaches to epidemic modelling. These are usually based on Sequential Monte Carlo (3, 4) , Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Markov Chain quasi-Monte Carlo (MCQMC) (5-7), Hidden Markov Models (HMM) (8) (9) (10) (11) , etc, each posing other assumptions, advantages and drawbacks -most commonly the availability or not of a significant amount of epidemic data upon which they are to be trained.",

According to the SEIQRDP formulation in Figure  13 , the \u03b1\u03c4 (independent of I(t)) term means that asymptotically all 'susceptible' S(t) will be transferred to 'insusceptible' P (t) compartment regardless of the convergence of 'infections' I(t) asymptotically to zero. This is not realistic for fixedsized populations, since the infection will probably fade out before everyone gets immunized (or dead), i.e., with some still remaining in S(t), due to the 'herd immunity' phenomenon (1, 2) . Each of the parameters of SEIQRDP model in the block diagram of Figure 13 and the corresponding system of differential equations provide very important hints regarding the dynamics of the underlying system, i.e., the evolution of the epidemic that the model describes, given enough data are available as ground truth. Since the SEIQRDP system of differential equations described by Eq.1 through Eq.7 indicate a specific underlying 'structure' for the systems' dynamics, i.e., solutions to interconnected differential equations, arithmetic Euler-like solution approaches can be used very early on, when the epidemic data are just beginning to accumulate on a day-to-day basis.

For this reason, Dynamic Time Warping (20, 21) was used for comparing Greece's infections I(t) curve to countries in the general region of Europe and central/eastern Mediterranean Sea, especially those in direct 'contact' with Greece via international flights. Figure 16 illustrates the original and the DTW-matched curves of Greece (blue) versus Switzerland (red). The DTW matching provides two important parameters for further study: (a) a more realistic estimate of the time offset for temporal alignment and (b) a DTW-based Euclidean distance that can be used as a similarity measure. Using these two parameters, Figure 17 illustrates the relative temporal difference (offset) and Figure 18 the DTW-based similarity of Greece-versusothers regarding the confirmed cases of infections I(t).",

This is observation coincides with two very important periodic trends of the COVID-19 outbreak, already documented empirically throughout the world (29, 30) : (a) the incubation period of the virus, mostly asymptomatic and thus highly contagious, is estimated at 5.1-5.2 days; and (b) the suggested quarantine safe period for the onset of symptoms in asymptomatic carriers or after their recovery is at least two weeks, i.e., associated with the long-term spectral component if incubation period is included (infection just before quarantine ends). Observation (a) can probably be associated with the short-term spectral component of days 4-6, i.e., the window between the onset of an infection and the manifestation of disease symptoms.

Finally, the asymptotically fading sinusoid (black) is a LSE-fitted approximation of g ( t) by\u011d(t), as defined by Eq.18, Eq.19 and Eq.20, with their LSE-optimal parameters presented in Table 2 . [19] z(t) = \u03b12 sin(\u03b11t \u2212 \u03b10) + (\u03b21t + \u03b20) [20] From the approximation curve in Figure 26 there is clear indication of three major factors: (a) periodic trend, captured by the first part of Eq.20 with \u03b1i parameters, (b) linear decreasing trend, captured by the second part of Eq.20 with \u03b2j parameters, and (c) asymptotically fading trend, captured by the 3rd-degree polynomial of Eq.19 with p k parameters. The periodic trend parameters, more specifically the \u03b11 = 0.713, can be translated from radians to daily temporal range via \u03b1 1/2\u03c0 = t /T where T = 49d is the current length of the data series for Greece (April 14th) since the first confirmed infection case (February 26th), hence yielding a period tp = \u03b1 1 T /2\u03c0 \u2248 0.011348T \u2248 5.56d. Again, this number almost coincides with the empirical data regarding the incubation (asymptomatic) period of COVID-19, estimated at 5.1-5.2 days (29, 30) . Additionally, the linear trend with marginally downward slope (\u03b21 < 0) shows a gradual slowdown of the 'force' of the outbreak in Greece, while the asymptotically fading trend captured by the 3rd-degree polynomial (p k ) shows that the 'bursts' or 'waves' of the newly reported infections (\u2206I(t)) are also fading out after less than T /tp \u2248 8.81 periods (5-6 in practice, according to Figure 26 ). Taking into consideration that the main mitigation measures (blue asterisks in x-axis) in Greece were activated just before each major 'peak' in (\u2206I(t)), it can be stated that they were imposed in a timely manner and, thus, they were appropriate and effective in containing the 'force' of the national outbreak until today.",

The purpose of this work was to re-estimate the general properties of SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 outbreak on the national level, in order to: (a) confirm that the available data series are adequate and their evolution in accordance to the research outcomes from other countries and on world-wide level; and (b) to estimate the progress of the outbreak on the mid-/long-term level, specifically for the epidemic phases, the expected peak date and magnitude, etc. The solution of the SEIQRDP system of differential equations defined in Eq.1 through Eq.7 was estimated by a standard LSE solver (22) for iterative matching of the predicted trajectories to the real data. For inclusion of a minimal underreporting of infections, I(t) data series was amplified by an additional +8% upon its recorded values. The LSE solver used centralized differential estimators, 1e-6 time step size (86.4 ms) and 1e-6 error tolerance for stopping criterion. In all cases, the process converged to a solution within less than 30 iterations, which hints that the actual epidemic data for Greece are well-described by the SEIQRDP model. Figures 27 and 28 present the best-fit solution of the SEIQRDP model (points) and its projection (lines) until August (2020), in linear and logarithmic scale, respectively. The dotted line in Figure 28 illustrates the onset of a subsequent surge of the outbreak if all the mitigation measures (quarantine) was to be deactivated immediately (April 15th).

Additionally, the rate of increase in the confirmed infections has been rising too, thus yielding an exponential growth, up to a point somewhere between days 71-73 past January 22nd, i.e., somewhere in April 2nd-4th (see: Figure  14 . Taking into account the evolution of the outbreak and the progress of the estimated epidemic parameters beyond this point, it seems that the rate of increase has been gradually slowing down until today. In fact, there have been three consecutive days in offset 81+ past January 22nd of decreasing slope in the rate of confirmed infections (April 12th-14th:",

In other words, it is now beyond phase 4 and well inside phase 5a, according to the descriptions in section 3. Based on this evidence and the fact that ICU needs (recently at 70 \u2212 80 and steady) are still well inside the currently available capacity of the country's health system (\u2248 990), ICU availability can be safely considered as guaranteed with a very high probability through the outbreak peak and beyond that. In the long-term, the SEIQRDP projection estimates the total number of fatalities directly related to COVID-19 at a few hundreds at most up to and including the entire summer, provided that the national epidemic will be tracked continuously and accurately, as well as an effective plan for adapting the mitigation measures appropriately in the next several months.",

Hence, additionally one or more outbreak surges are expected in the national level within the year, always in correlation to what is happening to neighbouring countries and international travelling, as well as the speed of deactivation of national mitigation measures (lift of quarantine).

On the negative side, the fadeout period seems to be in the order of several months, with high probability of recurrent surges of the outbreak. The mitigation policies for the 'next day' should be focused on close tracking of the epidemic via large-scale tests, strict border checking in international travelling and an adaptive plan for selective activation of mitigation measures when deemed necessary.",
