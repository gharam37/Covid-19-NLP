The reasons for gender disparity in disease severity is unclear and can be due to host factors. To determine whether males have delayed viral clearance after infection, we evaluated the time to clearance in symptomatic patients tested by serial oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swabs followed by RT-PCR at a reference lab in Mumbai, India. A total of 68 subjects with median age of 37 years (3-75 range) were examined and included 48 (71%) males and 20 (29%) females. We observed that females were able to achieve viral clearance significantly earlier than males, with a median difference of 2 days in achieving a negative PCR result (P value = 0.038). Furthermore, examination of 3 families with both male and female patients followed serially, demonstrated that female members of the same household cleared the SARS-CoV2 infection earlier in each family. To determine reasons for delayed clearance in males, we examined the expression patterns of the SARS-CoV2 receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in tissue specific repositories. We observed that the testes was one of the highest sites of ACE2 expression in 3 independent RNA expression databases (Human Protein Atlas, FAMTOM5 and GETx). ACE2 was also determined to be highly expressed in testicular cells at the protein levels. Interestingly, very little expression of ACE2 was seen in ovarian tissue. Taken together, these observations demonstrate for the first time that male subjects have delayed viral clearance of SARS-CoV2. High expression of ACE2 in testes raises the possibility that testicular viral reservoirs may play a role in viral persistence in males and should be further investigated.",

Nasopharyngeal/ orophryngeal swabs collected at the time of diagnosis were analyzed by RT-PCR for positivity/negativity per the Berlin protocol. 8 Subsequent swabs were collected at approximately 48 hours intervals until the swab test was documented to be negative. Persons residing in the same household as the index case as well as contacts were also tested. A log rank test was used to compare the difference in viral clearance between males and females and is represented in Figure 1 .B using Kaplan-Meier curves.

            "text": "Testes express high levels of ACE2 receptor: SARS-CoV2 enters cells via a complex, multiple-step process which begins with interaction of the viral surface spike protein with ACE2. 9,10 ACE2 is a plasma membrane bound monocarboxypeptidase that converts angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), which antagonizes the hypertensive effects of Angiotensin I via stimulation of the MAS receptor. 11 We evaluated ACE2 expression at the mRNA and protein levels using tissue specific databases. We observed that ACE2 is expressed at high levels in the lungs, GI tract, myocardium, testes, and brush border cells of the renal proximal tubule at the mRNA levels (Fig 2A) . Interestingly, the testes was one of the sites with highest ACE2 expression in 3 independent RNA expression databases (Human Protein Atlas, FAMTOM5 and GETx) (Fig 2B) , consistent with prior reports. [12] [13] [14] ACE2 was also determined to be highly expressed in testicular cells at the protein levels (Fig 2D, E) . Interestingly, very little expression was seen in ovarian tissue (Fig 2C,F) . These data raise the possibility that SARS-CoV2 may bind to testicular ACE2 and the testes may serve as a male specific viral reservoir. Consistent with this hypothesis, a very recent study demonstrated testicular gonadal loss-of-function in SARS-CoV2 patients, suggesting possible damage to testicular cells during infection. 15 Taken together, these observations demonstrate that male subjects have delayed viral clearance. High expression of ACE2 RNA and protein in testes leads to the hypothesis that testicular viral reservoirs may exist and play a role in viral persistence, and should be further investigated by larger clinical studies. This hypothesis may have important implications for understanding the transmission and persistence of SARS-CoV2 virus in humans, and in a gender-specific manner.",
