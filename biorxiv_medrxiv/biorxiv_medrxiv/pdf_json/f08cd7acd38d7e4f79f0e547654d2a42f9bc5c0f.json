Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has spread worldwide rapidly. As of 17 April 2020, there are more than 2,000,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases globally, among them at least 135,000 have resulted in death (World Health Organization). Based on its genome sequence, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to same genus (betacoronavirus) as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). SARS-CoV emerged in the Guangdong province of China in 2002 and resulted in an epidemic outbreak infecting 8,098 and killing 774 people (Drosten et al. 2003 , Walls et al. 2020 . MERS-CoV emerged in 2012 in the Arabian Peninsula, where it remains a major public health concern, having infected ~2519 and killed 858 people in 27 countries (Memish et al. 2020 , Walls, Park et al. 2020 . Phylogenetic analyses have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 shares 82% gene sequence identity with SARS-CoV ) and 51.8% gene sequence identity with MERS-CoV (Han and Yang 2020) . Coronaviruses (CoVs) comprise a large and diverse family. Though having such high gene sequence identity with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be transmitted among humans more readily and much faster than SARS-CoV (Li et al. 2003 , Wrapp et al. 2020 ) and MERS-CoV (Paraskevis et al. 2020 . COVID-19 clinical symptoms are fever, dry cough, severe respiratory failure, and pneumonia ). On 10 March 2020, COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) (World Health Organization 2020). Currently there is no proven treatment for COVID-19. Thus, there is a pressing need for the development of vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19.",

Host cell recognition and fusion between host cell and viral membranes is provided by large trimeric spike (S) glycoproteins located on the CoV membrane ( Fig. 1) (Belouzard et al. 2012 ). These S proteins interact with the human epithelial and respiratory cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors of the host cells (Letko et al. 2020 , Wrapp, Wang et al. 2020 . Upon receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage, large-scale conformational changes in S protein structure occur and S protein interaction with the host cell membrane takes place facilitating the fusion process. Due to their critical role in the entry of coronaviruses into host cells, SARS-CoV-2 S proteins have emerged as a popular and promising therapeutic target. In the current study, structure and dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is investigated via allatom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to provide critical atomic level insight into the conformational transition mechanism of S protein from a receptor inaccessible closed to an accessible open state, which in turn has the potential to strongly benefit development of therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.",

            "text": "Each S protein protomer consists of two functional subunits ( Fig. 1(c,d) ): S1 subunit is responsible for binding to host receptor and S2 subunit contains the membrane fusion machinery (Walls et al. 2017 , Kirchdoerfer et al. 2018 . S1 subunit comprises two functional domains: N-terminal domain (NTD) and a receptor-binding domain (RBD), both of which are responsible for the binding to the host cell receptor (Li, Moore et al. 2003) . S2 subunit contains three functional domains; fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat (HR) 1, and HR2 (Jiang et al. 2020) . Based on the RBD position, S protein can be in a receptor inaccessible closed or receptor accessible open state. As shown in Fig. 2 , in the receptor inaccessible closed state, all RBDs are in the down position covering the S2 subunits; whereas in the receptor accessible open state, at least a single RBD is in an up position being rotated outwards from S2, hence exposing its receptor binding surface. Conformational switch of RBD from the down to up conformation is a prerequisite for ACE2 binding of the S protein. There are two cleavage sites in each protomer of the S protein. Among them, the S2' site is located upstream from the FP. S1/S2 site, on the other hand, is located 103 residues downstream from S2' and located at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits. Cleavage at S2' sites is a requirement for fusion of host cell and virus membranes as it exposes the FPs at S2 to the environment and also separates the protein into S1-ectodomain and viral anchored S2 subunit. However, there is no consensus whether S1/S2 site cleavage is a requirement for S protein transition from pre to post fusion state. Upon S1/S2 site cleavage, S protein is divided into S1 and S2 subunits, which remain non-covalently bound in this metastable prefusion conformation (Bosch et al. 2003 , Park et al. 2016 CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https: //doi.org/10.1101 .04.17.047324 doi: bioRxiv preprint Wang et al. 2018 . During cell infection, S protein binds to the host cell receptor ACE2 via RBD (Li, Moore et al. 2003 , Wong et al. 2004 . Protein-receptor binding is expected to initiate a set of structural rearrangements in the S protein. Cleavage in S2' promotes rearrangement of HR1 in the S2 subunit into an extended \u03b1-helix and insertion of the FP into the host membrane. Subsequently, a six-helix bundle comprising HR2 and HR1 is formed (Bullough et al. 1994 , Bosch, van der Zee et al. 2003 , Walls, Tortorici et al. 2017 ). This completes the transition of the S protein from its metastable pre-fusion state to a highly stable post-fusion state. S protein conformational transition results in the fusion of viral and host membranes, thus allowing the release of the viral genome into host cell (Walls, Tortorici et al. 2017) . The first SARS-CoV-2 S protein structure was resolved in its open state and released on February 26 2020 with the PDB ID 6VSB. This structure had a 3.46 \u00c5 resolution and covers 76.8% of the sequence. Shortly after, on March 11 2020, SARS-CoV-2 S protein structures were resolved in their closed and open states having PDB IDs 6VXX and 6VYB. These closed and open structures have resolutions 2.8 \u00c5 and 3.2 \u00c5, respectively, and each cover 76.4% of the protein sequence. Based on the crystal structures, the transition between the two states can be predicted to occur through a hinge-like conformational movement of RBD transiently hiding or exposing the determinants of receptor binding. As of today, there are no all-atom MD simulations studies published that investigated the dynamics of any of the abovementioned close-to-full length SARS-CoV-2 S protein structures (PDB IDs: 6VYB, 6VXX, and/or 6VSB). The earliest being on February 21 2020, a few preprints of computational studies were recently deposited to bioRxiv investigating binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 (Peng et al. 2020 , Shah et al. 2020 , Smith and Smith 2020 and peptide/molecule binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD ",

As shown in Fig. 1 , these crystal structures comprise most of the S protein domains; S1 subunit (NTD and RBD) and S2 (FP and HR1). Furthermore, S trimers are extensively decorated with N-linked glycans ( Fig. 1) , which are important for proper folding (Rossen et al. 1998 ) and for modulating accessibility to host proteases and neutralizing antibodies (Walls et al. 2016 , Yang et al. 2016 , Xiong et al. 2018 , Walls et al. 2019 . Closed and open state crystal structures of the S protein were obtained by performing the following mutation: (i) R682S, R683G, and R685G, which were performed to abrogate furin S1/S2 cleavage site, and (ii) K986P and V987P, which were performed for stabilization (stabilizing structure). The trimeric crystal structures comprise the sequence A27-S1147 of each protomer. However, out of these 1121 residues there are structural information missing for 149 of them in the closed state: V70-F79, Y144-N164, Q173-N185, R246-A262, V445-G446, L455-C488, G502, P621-S640, Q677-A688, L828-Q853. For the open state, on the other hand, there are 155, 172 and 161 residues missing for its three protomers (denoted by A, B and C) as follows: V70-N81, T114-Q115, Y144-N165, Q173-N185, A243-A262, S443-G447, E471-Y489, G502, P621-S640, Q677-S689, P812, L828-L854 of protomer A, A67-D80, L141-A163, Q173-N185, I197-G199, L212-R214, A243-A262, L455-L461, D467-F490, E516-P521, P621-S640, Q677-A688, P812, L828-Q853 of protomer B, and A67-D80, Y144-N165, Q173-N185, .

In order to model the missing residue stretches and add them to the protein structures, the three-dimensional structures of the closed and open states were modeled using SWISS-MODEL web server (Waterhouse et al. 2018 ) using 6VXX and 6VYB structures, respectively, as templates. For both closed and open states, the FASTA sequence spanning residues A27-S1147 for each S protein protomer is taken from NCBI having RefSeq: YP_009724390 (O'Leary et al. 2016 ). Prior to submission to SWISS-MODEL, all mutations in the crystal structures were reversed in the sequence. Using VMD (Humphrey et al. 1996) , both closed and open crystal structures were separately solvated in water boxes each having at least 12 \u00c5 cushion of water in each direction. Ions were added to neutralize the system and NaCl concentrations were set to 0.150 M to represent a more typical biological environment. The size of the solvated S protein systems in the closed and open states were of ~410000 and ~415000 atoms in size, respectively.",

MD Simulations were performed at 310 K temperature and 1 bar pressure. Periodic boundary conditions were applied. Langevin dynamics was used to control the system temperature and pressure. All atoms were coupled to the heat bath. A time step of 2 fs was used. Two minimization-equilibration cycles were applied: All steps were applied under N, P, T conditions to relax water and find a local minimum of the whole system energy (Phillips et al. 2003) . The energy of the initial system was first minimized for 10000 steps. Water was then equilibrated by keeping the protein fixed for 2 ns. Then, the system was minimized for 10000 steps. After the second minimization step, a harmonic constraint, which has 1 \u22121 \u00c5 \u22122 spring constant, was applied to each C\u03b1 of the protein for 20 ns. At the third equilibration step, protein was released and the system was equilibrated for 5 ns. This equilibrium step is expected to be sufficient simulate the structural differences due to the radically different thermodynamic conditions of crystallization solutions and conventional MD simulations (Pullara et al. 2019 ). Finally, production MD simulations were performed. Atomic coordinates of all atoms, pressures and the energies were recorded every 10 ps. Two sets of MD simulations were performed for each of the closed and open states of the S protein. A total length of 800 ns of MD simulations starting from the crystal structures were performed. Table  I presents the complete list and length of each MD simulations performed in the present study.",

Thus, their C\u03b1 atoms were kept fixed during our SMD simulations. Pulling vector was constructed by first aligning closed and open state conformations via S2 of protomer B and subsequently constructing a vector pointing from the center of SMD atoms in the closed state conformation to the open state conformation. A pulling velocity of 1 \u00c5/ns was selected and spring constant is selected as 50 / /\u00c5 2 .

Since there is no noticeable structural difference between the RBD structures, the difference in the RBD mobility in the open and closed state is expected to be caused by differences in interdomain interactions of RBD. To this aim, interdomain salt bridges of RBD with the remaining parts of protein were investigated in the closed and open states. Based the closed state crystal structure, RBD forms the following three interdomain salt bridges with residues of neighboring protomer; K378-E988 and K386-D985 with domain S2, and E516-K202 with NTD. Significantly, upon performing MD simulations in the closed state the following additional interdomain salt bridges of RBD formed with its neighboring protomers: R408-D405 with RBD, K458-D985 with S2 domain, and K462-D198 with NTD (Fig. 2) . The distribution of the distances between the basic nitrogens and acidic oxygens of these 6 interdomain salt bridges of RBD are shown in Fig. 4 . As can be seen the most prevalent salt bridge observed in MD simulations was R408-D405. Compared to its down position, RBD made significantly less interdomain salt bridges in its up position. Although there were no interdomains salt bridges present for RBD of protomer B in its up conformation in the open state crystal structure, MD simulations demonstrated the formation of the following interdomain salt bridges of RBD of protomer B with its neighbors: D428-R403 with RBD of protomer A, and R357-E169 and R466-E132 with NTD of protomer C. The distributions of the distances between the basic nitrogens and acidic oxygens of these 3 salt bridges are depicted in Fig. 4(b) . ",

In order to investigate the solvent accessibility of these amino acids, close contact water molecules were calculated for the closed and open state MD simulations. To this aim, water molecules within 5 \u00c5 of the RBD amino acids involved in ACE2 binding were evaluated for each protein conformation sampled in the MD simulations. Notably, while the number of close contact water molecules were 433 for RBD in up position on average, the number of close contact water molecules was only 296 for RBD in down position of the closed state. As shown in Fig. 5(a) , the RBDs of the S protein trimer are closely packed in the closed state, hence strongly limiting water accessibility to amino acids K417, Y453, L455, F456, and Y505.

The location of the conformations, which were identified to be on the minimum free energy path, are shown in Fig. 6 (c). The pathway circumvents the energy barrier between the down and semi-open states by passing through the passage. For the transition between the semi-open and up states the mild passage in the middle of the energy barrier was selected as the crossing point since it was the shortest path connecting the low energy regions of the semi-open and up states. In order to have an understanding of the behavior and contribution of salt bridge breakage and formation during the conformational transition between the down and up state, the transition pathway was divided into 32 bins and salt bridges of all conformations located inside each bin were investigated. For each bin the distribution of the distance between the acidic oxygen and basic nitrogens of amino acids pairs K378-E988, K386-D985, E516-K202, R408-D405, K458-D985, K462-D198, R357-E169, D428-R403, and R466-E132 were evaluated. The bin averages of distances are depicted in Fig. 7 . It is to be noted that standard deviations of distances are not shown in Fig. 7 . As can be seen in distributions of Fig. 4 , for the listed interactions, the salt bridge forming requirement of acidic oxygen and basic nitrogens to be closer than 6 \u00c5 is not satisfied throughout the trajectory, yet strong interactions are conserved even at slightly higher distance. Thus, if conformers inside a bin are forming salt bridges frequently and otherwise strong interactions are preserved for the amino acid pairs, we will refer to this bin as a salt bridge forming bin for the sake of conciseness of the discussion.",

            "text": "MD simulations of the closed and open states show that the RBD in its up position shows higher mobility than RBD in its down position in the closed state. Analysis of the interdomain salt bridges of RBD suggest that the reason behind the higher mobility is the significantly lower number of interdomain salt bridges that RBD is forming in its up position. Interestingly, although solvent accessibility of the ACE2 binding interface of RBD is significantly limited in the closed state, there is still a significant amount accessible to the solvent. In fact, out of 17 amino acids of the ACE2 binding interface in RBD, 12 are solvent accessible in the closed state. This is a significant finding, as it potentially implicates that small molecule binding to inhibit the S protein in its closed state could be theoretically possible. Superposition of the ACE2 bound RBD structures clearly shows that it would be impossible for the S protein to bind ACE2 in its closed state. Thus, in contrast to an inhibitor binding to the open state, an inhibitor binding to the closed state would not need to compete with ACE2 for the binding interface. Energy landscapes based on our MD simulations suggest the existence of an intermediate semi-open state for the S protein, in which RBD of one protomer is halfway between its down and up positions. This semi-open state shows a distinct salt bridge network from the down and up states, and it remains to be explored whether this semi-open state could potentially be an effective drug binding target for therapeutics. Taken all together, our study provides unique atomic-level insight into the dynamics, interactions, and the solvent accessibility of the ACE2 binding surface of the S protein in its closed and open states. Moreover, conformational details and energetics of the down to up transition, which effectively puts the S protein in an active form, were explored. This extensive novel insight regarding S protein structure, dynamics, and energetics is expected to support the global drug and vaccine development efforts.",

Upon performing MD simulations starting from the closed (PDB ID: 6VXX) and open (PDB ID: 6VYB) state structures, our current study shows that a salt bridge network between RBD and neighboring protomers exist in the closed state all of which is are gradually abrogated along the closed to open transition of the S protein. Furthermore, closed state is stabilized by newly formed salt bridges with the neighboring protomer. MD simulations showed that solvent accessibility of the ACE2 binding surface of RBD changes significantly upon the transition between open and closed states. Our simulations provided a description of the energy landscape for the transition between closed and open states of S protein by sampling the conformational space near the structurally resolved states as well as the region connecting these states. A new semi-open state was identified approximately midway along the transition pathway.",

            "text": "from the closed and open crystal structures, two sets of MD simulations were performed for each of the closed and open states. As shown in Fig. 2, in the open state only a single RBD is in up position whereas for the closed state all 3 RBDs are in down position. In accord with the crystal structure, protomers in the open state will be denoted with A, B, and C, among which protomer B is in up conformation. Superposition of protomers in the closed state indicate that all protomers have almost identical structures, showing root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of ~1 \u00c5 based on the helix and beta sheet C\u03b1 atoms. Thus, each MD simulation for the closed state will generate 3 MD simulation trajectories of the down conformation of the protomer. In order to investigate the mobility of the RBD domain in the closed and open states of the S protein trimer, the distance between RBD and S2 domains were tracked throughout the MD trajectories. As shown in Fig. 3, the distribution of the distance between RBD and S2 demonstrated a significantly wider distribution in the RBD up position compared to that of the RBD down position (in the closed state MD simulation). Standard deviations of the RBD-S2 distance distributions were 1.3 \u00c5 for the up RBD and 0.5 \u00c5 for the down RBD. Thus, RBD in up conformation in the open state clearly shows higher mobility than RBD in down conformation in the closed state. FIG. 3. Distribution of the distance between RBD and S2 domain observed in MD simulations. The normalized distribution of the interdomain distances between RBD and S2 domain is shown for protomer B in (a) the closed state and (b) open state. The interdomain distance was calculated by evaluating the average of the distance between the C\u03b1 atoms of residue pairs K378(RBD)-E988(S2) and K386(RBD)-D985(S2). Distances in crystal structures are marked with black (PDB ID: 6VXX) and magenta (PBD ID: 6VYB) stars.Superposition of the RBD structures in the down and up position via the C\u03b1 atoms of the helices and beta sheets shows a minimal structural difference of 0.5 \u00c5 RMSD. Furthermore, RBD domain conformations were conserved throughout our MD simulations. Thus, based on the crystal structures and our MD simulations it can be predicted that RBD undergoes a rigid body",
