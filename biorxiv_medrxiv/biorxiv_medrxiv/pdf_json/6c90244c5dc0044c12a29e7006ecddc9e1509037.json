Since, the probability of testing positive in large population studies is expected to be small (<15%), therefore, most of the test outcomes will be negative. Here, we propose the use of agglomerative sampling which can prune out multiple negative cases in a single test by intelligently combining samples from different individuals. The proposed scheme builds on the assumption that samples from the population may not be independent of each other. Our simulation results show that the proposed sampling strategy can significantly increase testing capacity under resource constraints: on average, a saving of ~40% tests can be expected assuming a positive test probability of 10% across the given samples. The proposed scheme can also be used in conjunction with heuristic or Machine Learning guided clustering for improving the efficiency of large-scale testing further.

Assume that the (originally unknown) test result of each of the individuals is given by \u2282 {0,1}, = 1 \u2026 . Without loss of generality or introducing any limitations in the model, assume that for each individual, we are also given a set of d-features \u2208 (such as frailty, age, gender, contact with known or suspected CoV-2 infected patients, geographical location, symptoms, family/household dependencies, etc.,) that can be used to generate a degree of belief of that individual to test positive. We denoted this degree of belief by , = 1 \u2026 . In case, it is not possible to assign a belief to each individual, can be considered to be uniformly random, i.e., ~(0,1). Alternatively, belief can be assigned by a human oracle in a subjective manner or can be obtained through machine learning or probabilistic modelling based on the given set of features. If we cluster or mix individual samples into bags and proceed with testing these bags in a hierarchical manner, the number of required tests can be reduced by essentially pruning out multiple negative samples in a single test. For this purpose, consider a tree structure organization of the given set of individuals based on the degree of belief , = 1 \u2026 (or using the given set of features directly) as shown in the example figure below. The basic idea of agglomerative testing is that we test a bag of samples and if the bag level result comes out negative, then there is no need to test each of the samples individually. However, in case, the test comes out positive, we subdivide the samples into further clusters and test each of these bags next. This is continued until we get a test score of each individual. Furthermore, if a test for a bag comes out positive but the next sub-bag tests negative, then we know that the positive result is a consequence of a positive individual in the other bag which can be split further directly without additional testing. This guide algorithm based on even binary split is summarized in Algorithm-1. The figure below shows that if we obtain a mixed bag of all individual samples 1-8 and do a single test, the outcome will be negative and there is no need to do individual testing. For a bag comprising of cases 9-16, the result of the test will be positive because there is at least one positive individual in the bag. Doing this in a recursive manner can lead to reducing the number of tests required from 16 to 11 or 14 depending upon how the terminal nodes are tested. If we have access to informed belief values, then the given samples can be sorted with respect to their belief values prior to tree construction. Tree construction can also be done in an unsupervised manner based on existing individual features coupled with hierarchical or agglomerative clustering. [3] .",

This formulation captures the typical average case number of required tests using the proposed strategy.

However, it can significantly reduce the number of required tests when the probability is small, e.g., for community level testing.

The concordance of the belief value and the true status can be measured by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) between these values [4]: = 0.5 implies poor concordance between belief and the actual test status whereas = 1.0 implies perfect concordance. Please note that this AUC score is not between the test outcomes and the actual status but is used as a means of measuring the impact of the additive noise on the belief values for each individual. The degree of concordance is dependent upon the value of the noise factor : = 0 will result in perfect concordance ( = 1) in which case, no testing is needed as the belief is perfect whereas for large values of , the AUC value will be 0.5. Below we show the results of the proposed scheme for various values of , and . For = 1.0, we get an average AUC score of 0.75 and this leads to a moderate increase in the number of tests that can be saved in comparison to the no-belief simulation. This shows that even a weak belief assignment model coupled with the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the number of required tests. For = 0.5 (with an AUC score of 0.9), the saving is even more substantial (up to 60%). This clearly shows that the proposed testing scheme can lead to further improvements by incorporating belief through machine learning models or expert assignment.
