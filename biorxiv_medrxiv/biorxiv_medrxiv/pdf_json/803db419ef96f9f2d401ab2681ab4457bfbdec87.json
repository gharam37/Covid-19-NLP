In the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases, chloroquine can cause numerous side effects such as nausea, headache, pruritus, worsening of psoriasis, retinopathy, and cardiac dysfunction. While neuropsychiatric symptoms such as seizure, coma, and psychosis, were also reported in patients who received chloroquine [6, 7] , it is still unknown which neuropsychiatric symptoms are directly associated with the use of chloroquine, partly because of their relatively low frequency [8] . Understanding in advance the types of neuropsychiatric symptoms that may occur in patients treated with chloroquine, may be useful, particularly in patients with COVID-19 in intensive care units, where rapid clinical judgement is required.",

This database contains more than 9 million global case reports of potential adverse events of drugs. On April 1, 2020, we downloaded from the FDA's website (https://www.fda.gov) patient data that were reported between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. The FAERS database contains data tables named 'DEMO', 'DRUG', 'REAC', 'OUTC', 'RPSR', 'THER', and 'INDI', of which we mainly used the following 3 tables: 1) 'DEMO', which provides the case ID, sex, age, year of event occurrence, country of event occurrence, and the reporter's type of occupation (e.g., medical doctor, pharmacist, lawyer, consumer); 2) 'REAC', which contains all adverse events that are potentially caused by the drug used by each patient, and 3) 'DRUG', which includes the name, dose, indication, and date of administration and discontinuation of each drug that is possibly associated with that AE. In the 'DRUG' table, the causality assessment of the relationship between each drug and its reported AE is classified by the reporter as 'primary suspected', 'secondary suspected', 'concomitant', or 'interacting'. In our analysis, we included only reports that were classified as 'primary suspected' and 'secondary suspected', to reduce the risk of false positive association in deriving our conclusions. In addition, we included only reports that were reported from medical doctor, pharmacist, or other medical staffs, and not from lawyers or consumers.",

Our results showed a statistically significant association (albeit marginal) between the use of chloroquine and the reporting of LOC, amnesia, delirium, hallucination, and depression, however, there was no statistically significant association between the use of chloroquine and the reporting of suicide, psychosis, confusion, or agitation, suggesting that there is no link between the use of chloroquine and the increased risk of these AEs.
