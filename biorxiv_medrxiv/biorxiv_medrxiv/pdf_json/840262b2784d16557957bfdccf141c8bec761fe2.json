We study whether air quality affects the occurrence of severe influenza cases that require inpatient hospitalization. Using longitudinal information on local air quality and hospital admissions across the United States, we find that poor air quality increases the incidence of significant influenza hospital admissions. Effects diminish in years with greater influenza vaccine effectiveness. Apart from increasing vaccination rates, improving air quality may help reduce the spread and severity of influenza.",

The disease exhibits variability in spread and severity across individuals, regions, and over time. Prior research has produced two broad sets of findings to explain this variation: a) meteorological factors that affect the spread of the virus, such as temperature, sunlight and humidity (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) ; and b) individual level host factors, such as age, sex, underlying health and smoking that affect the intensity of symptoms (9, 10). We know considerably less, however, about how air pollution affects influenza spread and severity, a surprising gap given the pervasiveness of air pollution around the world and the well-established policy tools available to control it.",

Existing medical research finds exposing in vitro respiratory epithelial cells to air pollution increases susceptibility and penetration of influenza (13), and experimental exposure of mice to air pollution before influenza infections increased morbid-ity and mortality (16, 17) . Like humidity and temperature (5, 6, 7, 18, 19) , air pollution particles could also impact the airborne survival of viruses outside the body (18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24) and thus increase the probability of disease transmission.",

First, we exploit a long panel of influenza-specific hospital admissions from numerous states across the United States (U.S.) to estimate statistical models that exploit both spatial and temporal variation within counties over time, limiting threats from confounding factors. Second, to better understand the causal link, we explore the role of the influenza vaccine in moderating this relationship. If the vaccine reduces infections and the probability of influenza spread, seasons in which the vaccine is more effective should weaken the link between air pollution and influenza (37).",

Our principal outcome of interest is the number of inpatient ad-missions per county-month where the primary diagnosis is influenza according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (40). We combine this with high frequency air pollution readings of local ground monitors across the U.S., as well as data on local temperature, specific humidity, precipitation and wind speed (41). The richness of our data allows us to control for a wide variety of both regional and temporal controls. Our preferred specification includes county-by-year and month-byyear fixed effects. County-by-year effects control for differences in unobserved characteristics such as demographics, socio-economic factors, and health care access and protocols that influence pollution exposure and health outcomes across counties separately for each year. The month-by-year fixed effects control for general monthly and seasonal trends within each year in both influenza and pollution (42).",

            "text": "As our measure of pollution, we use the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Air Quality Index (AQI), which we aggregate to county-bymonth-by-year to match outcomes. The AQI is a measure of overall air quality based on the primary criteria pollutants specified in the Clean Air Act. Aggregation of pollutants means there are no real \"units\" for the measure. It is designed such that higher AQI values indicate worse air quality. To ensure we capture exposure to air pollution before diagnosis, we lag the AQI by one month. In all of our analyses, we focus on the influenza season (October to March). Figure 1 shows the seasonality of inpatient hospitalizations in our data (Figure 1a) , which matches closely with general influenza-like illnesses reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Figure 1b ). Figure  1c shows the age distribution of hospital admissions, which has important implications for vaccine effectiveness, described in more detail below. Figure 2a shows a clear positive correlation between air quality and count of influenza admissions in the raw data; higher AQI correlates with more influenza admissions (43). Figure 2b shows the correlation after adjusting both variables for fixed effects and weather controls. After this adjustment, a strong, positive correlation remains. Table 1 shows estimates from Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood regressions given the count nature of the dependent variable. The coefficients represent the change in the expected log of inpatient admission counts, which approximates a percentage change in number of county-year-month admissions within our data (44). Column (1) implies a 1-unit increase in the lagged monthly AQI results in a 0.56% increase in inpatient influenza admissions. To put this estimate in national context, a one standard deviation increase in AQI (12.79-unit increase in our data) amounts to approximately 4,064 additional inpatient hospitalizations for the 6-month influenza season in the U.S. (45).",

Figure 3 shows the regression-adjusted relationship between AQI and influenza admissions separately in seasons of low vaccine effectiveness and high vaccine effectiveness for the up to 8-year-old group and 65-year-and-older group, as determined by a median sample split (46). For both age groups, the relationship between air quality and admissions rates flattens and effectively disappears in years of high vaccine effectiveness. Columns (3) and (4) of Table 1 show a similar story using a more continuous measure of vaccine effectiveness. A vaccine effectiveness of 53% for the up to 8year-old group or 34% for the 65-yearand-older group nullifies the link between air pollution and influenza hospitalizations (47).",

Supplementary Appendix S.4 shows that our results are robust to either of these alternatives. We perform various falsification tests by repeating our analysis using health outcomes that should not correlate with air quality and health: diabetes mellitus with complications; urinary tract infections; skull and face fractures; and osteoarthritis (48).

The AQI captures pollution from particulate matter (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3). Further details on AQI calculation are provided by the EPA (63). We use the daily, county level, pre-aggregated data and further aggregate up to the county-by-month level. For missing county-months, we take the average value of the adjacent counties in the same month. We use the average value of the AQI within a month as well as the number of days with air at least \"unhealthy for sensitive groups\" according to the EPA (AQI\u2265100). We winsorize the AQI at the top and bottom 1% for the main analysis and show robust results without winsorization. For our analysis, we take the one month lagged AQI to identify exposure to air pollution before influenza diagnosis and not afterwards.",

Table S.2 contains summary statistics for inpatient hospital admissions with a primary influenza diagnosis, average monthly AQI per county-month, and the number of days with AQI \u2265 100. We use the standard deviation of the AQI during the influenza season (12.79) as well as the average inpatient hospitalization numbers (3.01) for the calculation of absolute effects based on our Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood estimation.
