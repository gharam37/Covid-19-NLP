Since the coronavirus is highly transmittable by droplets, more stringent control measures such as fast and mass testing, rigorous contact tracing, large-scale isolations, mandatory quarantines, travel restrictions or bans, border closing, social distancing, school closings, stay-at-home orders, and long-term lockdowns may be needed to contain the epidemic ultimately. Almost the whole world is now in the battle against the coronavirus as the global numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to rise speedily. methods specific for this epidemic, we tried to find an available easy-to-use tool to monitor the progress of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic as soon as possible. As listed on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) (https://cran.r-project. org/), several R packages might be used to compute basic reproduction numbers of an epidemic in R, including argo, epibasix, EpiCurve, EpiEstim, EpiILM, EpiILMCT, epimdr, 3 epinet, epiR, EpiReport, epitools, epitrix, incidence, mem, memapp, R0, and surveillance. We chose the incidence (version 1.7.0) and EpiEstim (version 2.2-1) packages to estimate R0(t) in R during the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in China due to their methodological soundness and computational simplicity for rapid analysis. 4, 5 Our R code was listed in Supplementary Appendix 2 for check and reuses.",

            "text": "First, we laid out the conceptual framework below. In an epidemic of infectious disease, any susceptible subject who becomes a patient usually goes through the following three stages: infection, development of symptoms, and diagnosis of the disease. Theoretically, to estimate R0 or R0(t), we need the information about the distribution of generation time (GT), which is the time interval between the infection of the index case and the infection of the next case infected directly from the index case. 5 Yet, the time of infection is most likely unavailable or inaccurate, and thus investigators collect the data about the distribution of serial interval (SI) instead, which is the time interval between the symptom onset of the index case and the symptom onset of the next case infected directly from the index case. 5 Nevertheless, the data of symptom onset are not publically available and almost always have the problem of delayed reporting in any ongoing epidemic of infectious disease because they are usually recorded at diagnosis. 2 Hence, we took a common approach in statistics to tackle this problem by specifying the best plausible distributions of SI according to the results obtained from previous studies of similar epidemics, and then applied the novel estimation method implemented in the EpiEstim package to the data of daily new confirmed cases in practice. 4, 5 Next, we considered two plausible scenarios for studying the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in China. The estimate_R function of the EpiEstim package assumes a Gamma distribution for SI by default to approximate the infectivity profile. 4 Technically, the transmission of an infectious disease is modeled with a Poisson process. 5 When we choose a Gamma prior distribution for SI, the Bayesian statistical inference leads to a simple analytical expression for the Gamma posterior distribution of R0(t). 5 In the first scenario, we specified the mean (SD) of the Gamma distribution for SI to be 8.4 (3.8) days to mimic the 2003 epidemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong. 5 Then, in the second scenario, we specified the mean (SD) of the Gamma distribution for SI to be 2.6 (1.5) days to mimic the 1918 pandemic of influenza in Baltimore, Maryland. 5 Given an observed series of daily new confirmed cases, the shorter SI, the smaller R0(t). According to the current understanding, the transmissibility of COVID-19 was higher than SARS, but lower than influenza. 1 Hence, although we did not know the true distribution(s) of SI for the ongoing epidemic of COVID-19 in China, 6 these two scenarios helped us catch the behavior pattern of this epidemic along with the time evolution.",

In terms of population size, the depletions due to death or recovery might be negligible in China. And, there were no imported cases of COVID-19 in China. These features made the task of modeling this epidemic in China relatively easier. However, since the COVID-19 was new to human society, its diagnostic criteria, control measures, and medical cares were inevitably changing during the epidemic as the knowledge and experience about it were accumulated continuously. 2 We decided not to exclude the added clinically diagnosed cases of the Hubei Province during February 12\u221216, 2020 for the robustness of our epidemic analysis. In addition, many recoveries were probably not susceptible any more in the late phase of the epidemic. Thus, the result obtained in this study was merely a rough estimate of R0(t).

Scientists and technology experts may try all the available tools to help the government fight the epidemic. The basic reproduction number, R0, for an infectious disease is the expected number of new cases infected directly from the index case in a susceptible population. As a measure of transmissibility, it tells us how quickly an infectious disease spreads out in various stages of the epidemic. 1 Most importantly, R0 can be used to assess the effectiveness of the implemented control measures and to explore the possibility of pathogen mutations in an epidemic. When R0 < 1.0 consistently, the epidemic would be damped down soon. 1 In essence, the value of R0 varies over time during an epidemic of infectious disease. Hence, as biostatisticians, we started this investigation on January 27, 2020 with the aim to estimate concurrently the time-varying reproduction number, R0(t), over time during the ongoing epidemic of COVID-19 in China. We also initiated a similar research project for estimating concurrently the time-varying reproduction number, R0(t), over time during the ongoing epidemic of COVID-19 in selected countries outside China, which would be reported later.",

Second, we admitted the time delay in our estimates of R0(t) for the COVID-19 epidemic in China due to the following two time lags: (1) the duration between the time of infection and the time of symptom onset (i.e., the incubation period of infection) if infectiousness began around the time of symptom onset 5 and (2) the duration between the time of symptom onset and the time of diagnosis. 2 Nevertheless, if asymptomatic carriers could transmit the COVID-19, 12 the first time lag would be shorter and it became the duration between the time of infection and the time of becoming infectious (i.e., the latent period of infection). Moreover, the time interval from symptom onset to diagnosis was shorter and shorter due to the full alert of society and the faster diagnostic tests. 2 Third, we assumed that the distribution of SI did not change considerably over time as the epidemic progressed.",

Yet, the number of new confirmed cases was still climbing up day by day until it reached the peak around February 4\u22125, 2020. During this very painful time period, everyone was keen to know: When would the epidemic curve reach the hilltop? 14 Although it was difficult to estimate the exact date when it would happen, the peak of 3,886 new confirmed cases on February 4, 2020 appeared right after the trend of the computing R0(t) was declining monotonically for about 10 days, and then the daily number of new confirmed cases began dropping, indicating that the COVID-19 epidemic had abated. Then, two weeks later, the estimated R0(t) surprisingly reduced to the level below 1.0 around February 17\u221218, 2020 in both scenarios. Our first epidemic analysis was done on February 24, 2020, which had led us to believe that the COVID-19 epidemic would end soon if the effective control measures were maintained and nothing else happened incidentally such as heavy case imports, super-spreaders, and virulent virus mutations. Finally, we observed that the COVID-19 epidemic in China closed up around March 7\u22128, 2020, indicating that the prompt and aggressive control measures of China 15-18 were effective. In the end, China would win the battle against the coronavirus as long as its resurgence, if any, is well managed.
