In most academic hospitals in the United States, inpatient rotations are designed to deliver optimal patient care by staggering rotations of attendings and house-staff, and much emphasis is placed on HCW burnout, yet during a pandemic preventing further infection is the single most important factor. Our purpose was to model various inpatient rotation schedules of physicians and nurses to determine patterns associated with optimal workforce preservation and lower nosocomial infections in settings in which personal protective equipment is imperfect or unavailable.",

Model parameters that varied by hospital setting and service type included average patient load per team, average patient hospitalization, and number of physicians and nurses on a team and on duty. The primary outcome measure was probability of team failure, defined as the likelihood that at some point there are insufficient attendings, house-staff or nurses to staff a fully functioning floor. In all our simulations, physician and nurse rotation lengths of 1-3 days led to higher team failure rates. Nursing shifts of 12 versus 8 hours and avoiding staggering of physician rotations decreased the chance of team failure.

[2, 3] Experience from other pandemics is not necessarily applicable, as infection and fatality rates are different. We therefore ran Monte Carlo simulations to explore various staffing possibilities with the goal of identifying staffing structures to minimize infections among HCWs on non-COVID-19 wards. For COVID-19 wards, in which the rate of patient-to-HCW transmission depends on personal protective equipment (PPE) and types of procedures and patient encounters, alternative input parameters for such simulations are needed;",

The first team had 30 nurses (five/shift), and the second 18 nurses (three/shift.) The average number of patients is set to 15/day (5 per nurse or 3 per nurse, in settings with different patient acuity.) Under normal circumstances, personnel rotations are staggered to ensure continuity of care and broad exposure for trainees to attendings and patients to enhance their educational experience. Rotation duration is also geared towards minimizing HCW fatigue. In a pandemic, these factors are considerably less important than HCW preservation. We compared scheduling options to minimize team failure, defined as the event that at some point there are insufficient attendings or housestaff/APPs to staff a fully functioning floor or insufficient healthy nurses to limit weekly hours to 48. Under all scenarios modeled each nurse works an average of \u226436 hours/week. Figure 1 depicts five staff scheduling scenarios for mean patient hospital stays of two and five days, typical for maternity and medicine floors, respectively, indicating team failure probability as a function of physician rotation length. We simulate situations in which cohorts of nurses co-rotate with physician rotations compared to nursing schedules that are independent of physicians.",

However, in all simulations analyzed, physician and nurse rotation lengths of 1-3 days led to higher team failure rates; shorter rotations result in exposure of more HCWs to an infected patient. When the average patient stay is much longer than 5 days or when the median latent period is much shorter than 4 days, the benefit of un-staggering rotations decreases (data not shown). When patient stays are short, such as on maternity wards, the advantage of un-staggered rotations is consistent and universal across various parameters.

Figure 1B ) for a schedule with 18 nurses, 3 attending physicians and 6 house-staff with physician rotations duration of four days. The designs simulated vary by whether they are staggered versus un-staggered, whether they have 8-hour nurse shifts versus 12hour nurse shifts, and whether nurses work consecutive days versus work alternating days. Note that in our simulations with nurses working consecutive days, when the physician rotations are sufficiently short, the nurses work the same number of consecutive days as the physician do; however, if the physician rotations are too long, the nurses are scheduled to work as many consecutive days as possible without exceeding 48 hours of work in the span of one week, and without exceeding 36 hours/week on average. Of note, due to unknown variables in the model, these plots do not suggest that the actual probability of team failure lies in the 20-60% range, but rather the plots are intended to demonstrate the relative improvement of various staff scheduling changes. From the plots in Figure 1A , and from similar plots that we generated with varying choices of the unknown parameters, we observe that scheduling designs with un-staggered rotations, 12-hour nursing shifts over consecutive days are favorable, and further, the probability of team failure is lower when all HCWs work at least 3-4 consecutive days. Figure 1B illustrates five designs for the case where the physician rotation duration is four days. Each physician is represented by a unique color. In each shift there are three nurses (triplet). The identity of the nurses in each triplet is fixed as long as all nurses in the triplet are healthy. Each triplet is represented by a unique color.
