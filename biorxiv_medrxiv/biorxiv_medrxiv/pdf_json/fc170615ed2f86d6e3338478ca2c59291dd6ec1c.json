Also assume, as in Section 3.2, that any infected travelers can only come from the unreported infected population in the epicenter -an assumption we find reasonable (as reported infected individuals would not be allowed to travel), but are able to relax in Section 3.3. Suppose now the hypothetical situation where we know the reporting rate of infections in the epicenter (the fraction of reported infections to the true number of infections), and that we know the number of travelers from the epicenter to another city/country. Assuming travelers resemble the population of the epicenter, we can calculate the expected number of infected (but unreported) travelers entering other cities/countries. Assuming further that we know the rate of transmission of the disease, we can then calculate the expected number of infections these travelers will have generated in these locations. Comparing the expected number of infections that arise from travelers to reported cases of the infection, we can estimate the reporting rate.",

Moreover, its results are very sensitive to knowing the transmission rate of the infection from travelers, as this allows us to project the number of infections in the destination city/country. Suppose now that we have access to the reporting rate of infections from another des-tination city/country, e.g. through universal or randomized testing, as has been done in Iceland. 5 This allows us to estimate how infectious the travelers from the epicenter are. Assuming that this transmission rate from travelers is the same (or a known function of) as the transmission rate at the destination city/country of interest, we can then calculate the expected number of infections we would expect from travel. Intuitively, the ratio between number of travelers to two destination cities/countries from the epicenter should tell us the ratio of total infections between the two cities/countries. Randomized or universal testing at one of the destinations, Iceland in our case, will give us its number of total infections, so total infections at the other destination can be computed.

In other words, we observe the outcome in U.S. with under-reporting, and the unobserved counterfactual outcome with full reporting is given by the benchmark Iceland.

We estimate a range of 1.5% \u2212 10% for the average reporting rate across the US with a reporting lag of 5 days and 4% \u2212 14% reporting rates when there is a lag of 8 days. Using only China as the epicenter, we observe similar patterns in \u03b1. For early March we note a relatively stable \u03b1 over T 1 . For very early choices for T 1 , our Iceland estimates of confirmed are very small, and this could create very noisy estimates of \u03b1 (the first case in Iceland was confirmed February 28). As we increase T 1 , we see an increase in \u03b1. This may be due to increases in the availability of test kits, which lead to higher reporting rates. However, this result may in part be due to unobserved/unaccounted travel, particularly within the United States, along with the fact that we do not have data on March travel into the US. Both of these factors would lead to under-reporting of travel for late March, and cause estimates of \u03b1 to be upward biased. Moreover, as we progress later into March, social distancing/health policy measures across Iceland and U.S. began to be applied, leading to differential changes in the transmission rate.",

This means that if there were half the confirmed cases in March 5 as in March 15, the total infections would be half of the randomized testing percent times the population of Iceland. This allows for us to consider T 1 closer to the onset of the infection than the randomized testing dates. We also remove the number of infected from Wuhan China from our data on confirmed infected in China due to the lock-down restrictions placed on this city. We use the first wave of deCODE testing to determine the percentage of the population that has contracted the disease. This testing took place during Mar 15 through Mar 19.

Those for epicenter c as I c,t , R c,t , U c,t . Let k be the lagged report period. At time t city i denote the lagged reported infected LR i,t = R i,t\u2212k . For epicenter c, the lagged reported infected is LR c,t = R c,t\u2212k .Define reporting rate at city i as \u03b1 = R i,t\u2212k I i,t\u2212k = LR i,t I i,t\u2212k and at epicenter c as \u03b1 c = R c,t\u2212k I c,t\u2212k = LRc,t I c,t\u2212k . This means that we are considering the reporting rate of lagged reported cases on the lagged total infection.",
