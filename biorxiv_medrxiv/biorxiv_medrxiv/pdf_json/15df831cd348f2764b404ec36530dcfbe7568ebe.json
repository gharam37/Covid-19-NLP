SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and often leads to severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and death in the elderly and subjects with pre-existing conditions, but the reason for this age dependence is unclear. Here, we found that the case fatality rate for COVID-19 grows exponentially with age in Italy, Spain, South Korea, and China, with the doubling time approaching that of all-cause human mortality. In addition, men and those with multiple age-related diseases are characterized by increased mortality. Moreover, similar mortality patterns were found for all-cause pneumonia. We further report that the gene expression of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, grows in the lung with age, except for subjects on a ventilator.",

Interestingly, the comorbidities have aging as a common factor and have been described in recent years as age-related diseases. A recent study reported estimates of the age-stratified case fatality rate and showed it to be lower in those below 60 years old (1,4% [0,4-3,5] ) compared to subjects who were 60 years or older (4,5% [1, [8] [9] [10] [11] 1] ) 5 .

Remarkably, accumulated and exhausted T cells secrete preferentially pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN and TNF. These cytokines can contribute, along with the innate immune system, to the low grade pro-inflammatory background observed in the elderly 9 , which may worsen COVID-19 outcomes and explain the elevated levels of inflammation. It is also possible that age-associated clonal hematopoiesis may contribute to the increased inflammation due to hematopoietic stem cell myeloid generation bias of pro-inflammatory macrophages and mast cells, and reduction of lymphoid differentiation 10 . Moreover, decreased T-cell capacity to properly activate antibody-secreting cells to further elicit effective immune responses may be compromised 11 . Yet, another possible explanation is thymus involution 12 . During aging, the thymus becomes atrophic and is gradually replaced by fibrotic tissue 13 . This results in a reduced number, or even complete abrogation, of exiting naive T cells 14 . In support of the importance of thymus involution, recent studies show that the age-stratified infection rate of COVID-19 correlates with involution of the thymus 15 . Together, all these features may result in the decreased ability of older people to fight viral infections, leading to age-related inflammation and higher susceptibility of the lung to the COVID-19-inflicted damage.",

This binding seems to be highly specific and facilitates the virus entry via endocytosis 16 . Therefore, the level of ACE2 expression may be a factor in COVID-19 infection. Expression of this protein is known to be affected by diverse stimuli and certain drugs used to treat hypertension, diabetes, and other diseases.

First, there is a time lapse between a person developing the symptoms, the case being detected and reported, and the outcome of the disease. Second, the detection of a newly emerged pathogen is biased towards clinically severe cases. Therefore, naive CFR (ratio of fatalities over confirmed cases) can be somewhat inaccurate in the assessment of disease severity, which could explain differences observed between different countries. Estimates of CFR attempting to correct for these effects have been produced by several groups 5, 18, 19 . Here, we used the CFR estimates adjusting for underlying demography and potential under-ascertainment of mainland China 5 . This allowed us to compare the doubling time of naive CFR and adjusted CFR. The doubling time obtained using the adjusted CFR was 7.16 years, approximately 10% shorter than the naive CFR. Nonetheless, the doubling time using adjusted CFR was not substantially different compared to other countries (Fig. 1D) . We further found that the rate of death from COVID-19 (adjusted to population size) grows exponentially with the median age of the country (Fig. 1E) , presumably because countries with older populations have a higher fraction of people who may succumb to this disease. The incidence of COVID-19 also grows exponentially with the median age of the country ( Supplementary Fig. 3) . Overall, the data show that not only CFR for COVID-19 grows exponentially with age, but its doubling time approaches that of all-cause human mortality. Together with a higher mortality for men than for women, this finding establishes COVID-19 as a disease of aging, with age emerging as a major risk factor for COVID-19.",

This observation was consistent in both men and women ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . We further analyzed age-related changes in gene expression for all genes expressed in the lung. ACE2 exhibited one of the highest correlation coefficients with age in patients that were not on a ventilator (Fig. 4C) . ACE2 shows increased expression in subjects on a ventilator not only in the lung but also in several other tissues ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). It is of interest that ACE2 is also upregulated by several drugs that are used to treat hypertension, a dominant pre-existing condition associated with COVID-19 mortality (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, the expression of TLR7 in the lung is decreased with age, which may contribute to a poor immune response in the elderly (Fig. 4B) . The expression of ACE2 as a function of age was analyzed in GTEx samples from subjects diagnosed with hypertension and other common COVID-19 comorbidities (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 7 ). In addition, we evaluated the expression of genes related to the immune function in the lung and observed genderassociated differences, e.g. an age-related upregulation of pathways, such as innate immune response and negative regulation of adaptive immunity. Interestingly, the viral genome replication pathway was found to be upregulated ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ).",

Further studies are needed to assess the effect of age on the infection rate.

Our observation of increasing incidence rate with age is consistent with previous studies of the incidence and MRDT of community acquired pneumonia in Germany 22 . The mortality associated with pneumonia increased faster in the elderly patients.

Our finding of an elevated age-related expression of ACE2 in the lungs of subjects with non-ventilator deaths may provide a clue. ACE2 is the site for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell. An age-related increase in the expression of this gene, together with the depletion of antiviral defenses, would naturally support a higher damaging effect of the coronavirus in the lung. It should be noted, however, that while ACE2 specifically promotes SARS-coronavirus infections, it also protects lungs from injury 28 . In addition, various tissues harbor different ACE2 gene expression levels and may account for complications other than pneumonia, such as diarrhea observed in a small sample of COVID-19 positive patients. At the protein level, lung and its alveolar type II cells were found to have low or undetectable ACE2 protein levels. Interestingly, ventilator cases showed no increase in ACE2 expression with age. The main difference between ventilator and non-ventilator cases is in the young subjects, wherein the expression of ACE2 in the ventilator cases is higher ( Supplementary Fig. 10 ). The implications of variable expression patterns of ACE2 mRNA and protein across ages, tissues, and ventilator cases should be investigated in further studies.",

Age-related changes in SARS-CoV-2 receptor gene expression. Expression of (A) ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and (B) TLR7 in the human lung. P-value was calculated using Mann-Whitney test, ns -not significant, * p<0.05, ** p<0.01. (C) Distribution of genome-wide correlations between age and expression of genes in the lung. ACE2 is one of top genes whose expression increases with age. GTEx was used for these analyses. Cases on ventilator immediately before death were excluded.",
