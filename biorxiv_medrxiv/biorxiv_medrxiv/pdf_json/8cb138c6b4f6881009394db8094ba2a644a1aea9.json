We find an excess mortality that is correlated in time with the COVID-19 reported death rate time series. Our analysis shows good agreement with reported COVID-19 mortality for age<70 years, but an excess in total mortality increasing with age above 70 years, suggesting there is a large population of predominantly old people missing from the official fatality statistics. We estimate that the number of COVID-19 deaths in Italy is 52,000 \u00b1 2000 as of April 18 2020, more than a factor of 2 higher than the official number. The Population Fatality Rate (PFR) has reached 0.22% in the most affected region of Lombardia and 0.57% in the most affected province of Bergamo, which constitutes a lower bound to the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR). We estimate PFR as a function of age, finding a steep age dependence: in Lombardia (Bergamo province) 0.6% (1.7%) of the total population in age group 70-79 died, 1.6% (4.6%) in age group 80-89, and 3.41% (10.2%) in the age group above 90. We combine this with the Test Positivity Rate to estimate the lower bound of 0.84% on the IFR for Lombardia. We observe IFR to trace the Yearly Mortality Rate (YMR) above 60 years, which can be used to estimate the IFR for other regions in the world. We predict an IFR lower bound of 0.5% for NYC and 26% of total COVID-19 mortality arising from the population below 65 years, in agreement with the existing data and several times higher than Lombardia. Combining PFR with the Princess Diamond cruise ship IFR for ages above 70 we estimate the infection rates (IR) of regions in Italy, which peak in Lombardia at 23% (12%-41%, 95% c.l.), and for provinces in Bergamo at 67% (33%-100%, 95% c.l.). This suggests that Bergamo may have reached herd immunity, and that the number of infected people greatly exceeds the number of positive tests, by a factor of 35 in Lombardia * .",

Official data accounts for those that have been tested, mostly in the hospitals, while there may have been other deaths that were not tested and went unrecorded, suggesting an underestimate of the death rate by the official COVID-19 numbers. In addition, the official COVID-19 death statistics can be complicated to extract, as most of the infected patients that die in hospitals also suffer from other co-morbidities. Given the uncertainties in the official COVID-19 fatality rate, it is important to explore other paths for obtaining it. In this article we propose a Data Science based counterfactual analysis, where we compare the weekly mortality rate for Italian regions in the first 3 months of 2020 with a model prediction obtained from historical mortality rates at the same time of the year. The model accounts for historical year to year variability due to the fluctuations caused by seasonal effects. We attribute the difference between the true 2020 data and the predicted counterfactual as excess deaths due to COVID-19.",

It is the best prediction given the historical probability distribution of the death rate time series data, combined with the trend in the data before the beginning of the pandemic.

The CGP and SCM predictions and CGP errors are shown, as well as the historical 2015-2019 data and their mean. We note that the SCM and CGP methods both trace the pre-pandemic data closely (the latter by construction). However the historical mean estimates are generally higher, reflecting the fact that mortality in Italy has been below-average in the first 2 months of 2020, probably due to a milder than usual flu season. SCM and CGP are a better choice of a counterfactual than the historical mean because they can account for yearly variations that are time correlated. Figure 1 shows a clear excess in mortality over the counterfactual predictions after the week ending on Feb 22, when the first COVID-19 related deaths were reported in Italy. In Figure 2 , we show the excess deaths over the expected counterfactual for every week of reported data. In Figures 2 and 3 we have extrapolated this data to April 18 with a conservative assumption that the weekly excess mortality is the same as the reported COVID-19 deaths on April 11 and beyond. This is based on the observation that the ratio of weekly excess to reported COVID-19 deaths is decreasing with time in all the regions, as expected based on the increased testing. As of March 28 (Figure 2 ), the lowest ratio is in Lombardia of 1.5. We expect our procedure to give a lower-bound on the total deaths. Figure 2a shows that the excess weekly mortality is significantly higher than the official COVID-19 deaths in all regions. Figure 2b shows the cumulative excess in mortality compared to the total reported COVID-19 deaths at the end of each week. As of March 28, we find that the worst affected states such as Lombardia and Emilia-Romagna have likely under-estimated the mortality by factors of 2-3. Other regions like Puglia and Toscana which do not report a huge number of fatalities have already suffered around 1000 deaths each by that date.",

We infer the time-lag and amplitude by minimizing \u03c7 2 . We obtain best fit time-lags of \u22126 \u00b1 0.5 days for Lombardia and \u22124 \u00b1 1 days for Emilia-Romagna, and consistent, but noisier, results from other regions. The inferred time-lag suggests that the official COVID-19 mortality lags behind the total mortality, possibly a consequence of a hospital treatment postponing death on average by several days. Correlation is not causation, so attributing the excess death rate to COVID-19 is still a strong assumption. We discuss possible caveats. COVID-19 has put an enormous pressure on Italy's medical system and social services. This could have led to an excess mortality in some scenarios that would otherwise not be fatal, causing us to overestimate the COVID-19 deaths. However, the pressure on the medical system is regional and was likely sustainable for regions with a low number of official COVID-19 deaths and we consistently find a very large excess in mortality in most of the regions in Italy, including those that reported nearly zero COVID-19 deaths. The temporal trend also lends a similar argument: the societal and medical systems should function normally in the earliest stages of the pandemic and get increasingly stressed as the number of infections increases, while we see that the ratio of excess deaths over reported COVID-19 fatalities rapidly increases early, and then decreases as the number of reported infections increases. The ratio has decreased to 1.5 for March 28 in Lombardia. Our hypothesis is that the excess deaths over official COVID-19 deaths are primarily due to the lack of testing in the initial stages of the pandemic. With the increase in testing as the pandemic evolves, the reported fatalities due to COVID-19 slowly catch up with the true current mortality.",

In addition to the hardest-hit regions in Italy, we also show this for the province of Bergamo. We find a steep age dependence of PFR: in Bergamo province, 1.71%, 4.62%, and 10.1% of the entire population in the age groups 70-79, 80-89, and 90+, respectively, died, or 0.57% of entire population (PFR).

To estimate the IFR from the PFR, we need the infection ratio (IR) of the population. Here we have used the Test Positivity Rate (TPR), the fraction of positive to total tests, as the fraction of infected population. Due to the criterion of primarily testing people with symptoms, this should be an upper bound on the IR during the first few weeks of infection, hence making this IFR a lower bound.

As of April 18, 11 out of 330 DP infections in the age group above 70 had been fatal. This results in an IFR for this age group of 3.3% and we assign Poisson distribution errors to this. The population distribution in this age group on the DP was 80% in 70-79 and 20% above 80 6 . For each region of Italy, we match this age distribution to estimate the age weighted IFR to DP in the above 70 age group. Combining it with the corresponding PFR, we are able to estimate an IR for this age-group. Under the assumption of age-independent IR, we also derive IFR for all the other age-groups (Table 1 ). IR range from 4% up to 23% (12%-40% 95% cl) in Lombardia and 65% (32%-100% 95% cl) in the province of Bergamo, suggesting it may have reached herd immunity.

To predict these numbers for other locations we can use our observation that IFR age dependent estimates are similar to the YMR of a given population above age of 60 ( Table 2 ): in Lombardia the fraction of YMR derived deaths below age of 65 (70) is 10% (15%) of all yearly deaths, similar to the COVID-19 official fractions. The corresponding YMR derived fractions for NYC are 26% and 34% m , which we use as our estimate of COVID-19 fractions of deaths below 65 (70) for NYC, and are more than two times the Lombardia number.

It suggests that COVID-19 kills the weakest segments of population as tracked by YMR, which is primarily driven by the age distribution and health status of the underlying population.",

However, we already have nearly complete data for the province of Bergamo and Lombardia, 74% and 72% respectively, and most of our fatality analysis uses these two only. We find good agreement between reported COVID-19 deaths and our estimated excess fatalities for ages below 60 years, so we expect this scaling to not bias our results significantly. 2) We attribute all the excess deaths to COVID-19 fatalities. The most direct way to verify this is to perform COVID-19 tests on every fatality, which is currently not done in any location. We can also repeat our analysis in other locations in the world, which would allow us to verify some of the alternative explanations, such as a concurrent flu outbreak. Such data is becoming available for some locations (NYC, France, Spain) and our preliminary analysis suggests a similar underestimation of COVID-19 deaths by official numbers.",

This could be further tested by the TPR as a function of age data, which exist, but are currently not published. Our age dependent PFR from the province of Bergamo (and NYC) give a lower limit to the IFR (Figure 4 ) independent of IR.

The observed data in 2020 is shown in black, while the predicted counterfactuals by conditional Gaussian Process (CGP, section ??) and synthetic controls method (SCM, section ??) are shown in green and orange, respectively. The historical data from 2015-2019 and corresponding mean is shown by the thin blue and pink lines, respectively. The 1 sigma confidence interval for CGP estimate is shown with green shaded region.

Estimates from both the counterfactuals, SCM (orange) and CGP (green) agree. We find that COVID-19 deaths are under-reported by multiple factors for every period and every region. We extrapolate the data excess beyond March 28th with dashed-lines. To do this, we make a conservative assumption that the ratio of excess deaths to COVID-19 reported deaths approaches 1 on April 11 linearly.",
