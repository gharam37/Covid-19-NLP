The 3C-like protease (3CLpro), a highly conserved protease indispensable for replication of coronaviruses, is a promising target for development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. To advance the speed of drug discovery and development, we investigated the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro by natural products derived from Chinese traditional medicines. Baicalin and baicalein were identified as the first non-covalent, non-peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and exhibited potent antiviral activities in a cell-based system. Remarkably, the binding mode of baicalein with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro determined by X-ray protein crystallography is distinctly different from those of known inhibitors. Baicalein is perfectly ensconced in the core of the substrate-binding pocket by interacting with two catalytic residues, the crucial S1/S2 subsites and the oxyanion loop, acting as a \"shield\" in front of the catalytic dyad to prevent the peptide substrate approaching the active site. The simple chemical structure, unique mode of action, and potent antiviral activities in vitro, coupled with the favorable safety data from clinical trials, emphasize that baicalein provides a great opportunity for the development of critically needed anti-coronaviral drugs.",

The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in complex with baicalein was determined at a resolution of 2.2 \u00c5 ( Fig. 2 ; Table S2 ). The protease has a catalytic Cys145-His41 dyad and an extended binding site, features shared by SARS-CoV 3CLpro and MERS-CoV 3CLpro ( Fig.   2A ). The inhibitor binds in a core region of the substrate-binding site at the surface of the protease, between domains I and II (Fig. 2, A and B) . Examination of the active site of the complex revealed that three phenolic hydroxyl groups of baicalein made multiple hydrogen bonds with main chains of Leu141/Gly143 as well as side chains of Ser144/His163 with or without the aid of a buried water molecule (Fig. 2C ). The only carbonyl group established a hydrogen bond with the main chain of Glu166, while the free phenyl ring inserted into the S2 sub-pocket by making hydrophobic interactions with multiple residues Gln189/Arg188/Met49/Cys44/His41. Notably, apart from the hydrophobic interactions, the catalytic Cys145 and His41 also formed S-\uf070 (a distance of 3.3 \u00c5 from the sulfur to the centroid of the phenyl ring) and \uf070 -\uf070 interactions with the aromatic rings of baicalein, respectively. The side chain of Asn142 also established NH2-\uf070 (a distance of 3.6 \u00c5 from the nitrogen to the centroid of the phenyl ring) interactions with baicalein, which together with the interactions contributed by Cys145 lead the phenyl ring with three OH groups to be sandwiched between Cys145 and Asn142. Moreover, Met165 contacted the middle ring of baicalein via hydrophobic interactions. Consequently, baicalein is perfectly ensconced in the core of the substrate-binding pocket and interacts with two catalytic residues, the oxyanion loop (residues 138-145), Glu166, and the S1/S2 subsites, which are the key elements for recognition of substrates as well as peptidomimetic inhibitors (17).

There are 12 residues differed in two proteases and none of them participates in the direct contacts with baicalein. The high level of sequence identified between two proteases allows one to assume that baicalein will bind to the SARS-CoV 3CLpro in the same way as it does to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The inhibition assay shows that baicalein can also inhibit SARS-CoV 3CLpro, with an IC50 of 1.18 \u00b1 0.37 \u00b5M. Thus, a three-dimensional model of SARS-CoV 3CLpro in complex with baicalein was constructed by superimposing the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro/baicalein with that of SARS-CoV 3CLpro/TG-0204998 (PDB code 2ZU4) (Fig. S4A ). The binding mode of baicalein with SARS-CoV 3CLpro is distinctively different from those of known inhibitors. All of the crystal structures of the inhibitor-bound SARS-CoV 3CLpro were collected for a comparison analysis (Fig. S4B ). If those peptidomimetic inhibitors are delineated like \"swords\" to compete with the binding of substrate, baicalein works as a \"shield\" in front of two catalytic dyads to prevent the approach of the substrate to the active site (Fig. S4B ). Such a unique binding mode in combination with its high ligand-binding efficiency and small molecular weight renders baicalein valuable for drug development.",

Subsequently, the Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS- CoV CoVs. The substrate specificity of 3CLpros is featured by the efficient cleavage in the peptides including (Leu,Phe,Met,Val)-Gln\uf0af(Ser,Ala,Gly) sequences (the cleavage site is indicated by \uf0af), and the crystal structures have revealed a remarkable degree of conservation of the substrate-binding sites, particularly for the crucial S1/S2 subsites (7, 19, 20) . Accordingly, substrate analogs or mimetics attached with a chemical warhead targeting the catalytic cysteine were designed as peptidomimetic inhibitors of 3CLpros with a covalent mechanism of action (6). A series of diamide acetamides acting as non-covalent SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors and their binding modes examined by crystal structures have been reported, but they are more or less peptidomimetic inhibitors and a continuous development of these compounds is absent author/funder.

S. baicalensis is also the major component of Chinese traditional patent medicines such as \"Shuanghuanglian\" and \"Qingfei Paidutang\" which have proven effective in curing patients of COVID-19 in China (22) . As a result, we identified two small natural products, baicalin and baicalein, as the first class of noncovalent, non-peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro by the enzymatic assay in combination with the ITC, ESI-MS, and X-ray protein crystallography studies. In contrast to most available covalent, peptidomimetic inhibitors of the 3CL proteases, the ITC measurement also revealed that these two compounds are non-covalent inhibitors with a high ligand-binding efficiency. The binding mode of baicalein with the protease revealed by the crystal structure demonstrates that a unique protein-ligand interaction pattern is utilized by baicalein to block the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The crystal structure of baicalein-bound SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro thus reported the first demonstration, to the best of our knowledge, of ",

The antiviral efficacies were evaluated by quantification of viral copy numbers in the cell supernatant via quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). As shown in Fig. 3, both baicalin and baicalein showed a dose-dependent inhibition on the replication of SARS-CoV-2, and the resulting half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) of the two compounds were 10.27 and 1.69 \uf06dM, respectively. The corresponding selectivity index (SI = CC50/EC50) values are \uf03e19 and \uf03e118 for baicalin and baicalein, respectively. Therefore, the cell-based antiviral activity of baicalin or baicalein is superior to most of the reported compounds and that of baicalein is close to those of chloroquine (EC50: 1.13 \uf06dM; SI > 88) and remdesivir (EC50: 0.77 \uf06dM; SI > 129) (18). Discussion Three global pandemics, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, have raised great awareness about the increasing risks of highly pathogenic CoV infections in humans or animals and call for the development of efficacious anti-coronaviral drugs. 3CLpros provide a promising target for development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.

With a molecular weight of 270.24 Da and a Kd of 4.03 \uf06dM, baicalein serves as the most efficient binder of 3CLpros known to date. Moreover, it possesses an antiviral activity in the cells with a low cytotoxicity. Given the high conservation of 3CLpro among various CoVs, baicalein is expected to inhibit other 3CL proteases of CoVs, providing a new candidate for development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. In addition, baicalin tablets have been used as an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of acute, chronic, or persistent hepatitis in China. Single oral doses of 100-2800 mg of baicalein were safe and well tolerated by healthy subjects (clinical trials registration number CTR20132944) (23). Furthermore, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, and phase IIa clinical trial for the effectiveness and safety of baicalein tablets in of improving other aspects of healthy adults with influenza fever is under way (clinical trials registration numbers CTR20182427 and NCT03830684). These favorable safety data together with the potent inhibitory activities in enzyme and cell-based assays show a strong preference for in vivo and clinical trials studies of baicalin and baicalein for COVID-19 treatment. Overall, the present study provides a good example for exploring the in vitro potency of TCMs and effectively identifying bioactive ingredients toward a specific target, especially when Chinese traditional patent medicines have been proven effective in curing patients of COVID-19 in China.",

The sample solutions were infused to the system with syringe (50 \u03bcL) at a flow rate of 120 \u03bcL/h using electrospray ionization in a positive ion mode. Data were acquired in the mass-to-charge (m/z) range 400-6000 with a transient length of 3.92 s in quadrupolar detection resulting in a resolving power of 54.0 ppb at m/z 3240. The source and ion transfer parameters were optimized as follows: Skimmer 1 100 V, Funnel 1 180 V, Funnel RF Amplitude 200 V, collision cell frequency 2.0 MHz, ion transfer frequency 2 MHz, time of flight to analyzer cell 2.0 ms with RF amplitude of 350 V, and source temperature 200 o C. For the protein performance optimization, the mass range around the change stated 18+ was isolated with the quadruple using a quadrupole mass window of 200 Da with a center mass of the quadrupole of m/z 3750; the magnitude size was set to 4M; 200 single scans were added.",
