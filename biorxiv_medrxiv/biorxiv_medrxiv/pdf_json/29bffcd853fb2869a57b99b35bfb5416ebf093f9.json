The parameter \u03b1 is the infection rate (to be estimated) and 1/\u03b2 is the mean time until an infected becomes recovered. Based on the results in [12] , the median period of viral shedding is 20 days, but the infectiousness tends to decay before the end of this period: the results in [13] show that infectiousness starts from 2.5 days before symptom onset and declines within 7 days of illness onset. Based on these observations we assume here that 1/\u03b2 = 10 days. The initial conditions are S(t 0 ) = N \u22121, I(t 0 ) = 1 and R(t 0 ) = 0, where N = 67 10 6 corresponds to the population size. The SIR model is started at some time t = t 0 , which will be estimated and should approach the date of introduction of the virus in France (this point is shortly discussed at the end of this paper).
