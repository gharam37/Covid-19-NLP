The implementation of 11 molecular assay testing in a rapidly evolving public health emergency can be hindered by resource 12 availability or technical constraints. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the applicability of 13 a pooled-sample testing protocol to screen large populations more rapidly and with limited 14 resources is discussed. A Bayesian inference analysis in which hierarchical testing stages can have 15 different sensitivities is implemented and benchmarked against early COVID-19 testing data. 16 Optimal pool size and increases in throughput and case detection are calculated as a function of 17 disease prevalence. Even for moderate losses in test sensitivity upon pooling, substantial increases 18 in testing throughput and detection efficiency are predicted, suggesting that sample pooling is a 19 viable avenue to circumvent current testing bottlenecks for COVID-19.

Key epidemiologic strategies for control of community spread include contact tracing, 23 case isolation, ring containment, and social distancing (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . The use of microbiological testing to 24 identify disease cases is a crucially important element of these strategies. Some countries, including 25 the US, experienced a shortage of kits needed for COVID-19 diagnosis, which resulted in the 26 imposition of restrictive criteria to manage the selection of patients for testing. Constraints in the 27 supply of kits had a particularly significant impact on testing of mildly symptomatic individuals, as 28 well as asymptomatic contacts of confirmed cases. For some facilities that have been overwhelmed 29 by demand for testing as the pandemic progressed, test throughput continues to be a limiting factor 30 (8-10). Strategies for screening more individuals with a reduced burden on resources are highly 31 desirable. Using a Bayesian formalism, a hierarchical testing protocol based on sample pooling is 32 discussed. Anticipated benefits include easing the demand of constrained resources and enabling 33 more efficient detection of a larger number of cases. 34 Molecular assays are the predominant testing method for viral and bacterial pathogens (11-14). 35 Specifically, nucleic acid detection assays typically employ real-time polymerase chain reaction 36 (RT-PCR) for DNA targets and reverse-transcription real-time PCR (rRT-PCT) for RNA targets 37 (15, 16) . The popularity of such testing platforms is due to 1) their high sensitivity and specificity, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.024216 doi: bioRxiv preprint 5 Besides testing throughput, it is informative to assess the increased ability to detect cases using a 93 pooled-sample vs individual-sample scheme, which can be accomplished by comparing the ratio of 94 detected to missed cases in each protocol. Importantly, resource constraints are incorporated into 95 this comparison by accounting for unscreened cases in the standard 1:1 scheme (Eq. S6-8). The 96 relative increase in the detection-to-miss ratio between the pooled and standard 1:1 schemes 97 exhibits even more significant gains than those observed for testing throughput (Fig. 1) . Loss in screening power associated with sample pooling is assessed by 1) estimating the portion of 103 cases that would have been identified in an individual test but missed by pooled screening, and 2) 104 determining the information gained for patients whose pooled screening result was negative. 105 A reduction in overall pathogen concentration due to pooling in conditions of low disease 106 prevalence can decrease the test's identification rate, although it is manageable when targeting 107 infectious diseases for which typical pathogen concentrations are non-negligible (23). This concern 108 is examined with a set of 186 positive rRT-PCR diagnostic test results for COVID-19 (Fig. 2) , The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.024216 doi: bioRxiv preprint 7 detected if the same number of tests were used on single patients -the multiplicative factor in 127 testing throughput scaled by the loss in sensitivity, \u2022 . Loss in sensitivity also leads to more 128 screened-yet-missed cases -even in the absence of pooling, diagnostic tests yield false negatives 129 and increasing those odds should not be considered lightly. In the range of disease prevalence with 130 moderate to high increase in throughput and compared to individual testing of every patient, a = 131 0.9 sensitivity loss leads to a relatively low increase in posterior probability of disease after a 132 negative test outcome, ( |\u2212) (Fig. 3) . While sensitivity losses decrease the ability to confidently Advantages in testing throughput and case detection 296 We can estimate the ratio of detected-to-missed (including unscreened) cases for each protocol 297 with the following simplified analysis: 298 In the pooled scheme, the number of detected cases are the total number of screened individuals 299 with the disease \u2329 \u232a ( ) multiplied by the effective detection probability \u2022 , which 300 includes the sequential detection probability at the pooled stage and the follow-up individual stage. 301 The number of missed cases would thus be the difference between detected and total cases, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.024216 doi: bioRxiv preprint",

While nucleic acid assays have powered a revolution in diagnostics and delivery of care41    for individual patients, their application in large-scale infectious disease surveillance is hampered 42 partly by low throughput at a population level.43    The information content of a diagnostic test can be evaluated with a Bayesian probability formalism44    in the context of an individual sample or for repeated sampling from the same patient (17-19) requires the assessment of a \"prior\" probability to the presence of disease in a 48 sample, ( ), which is updated to a \"posterior\" probability given a positive or negative test result49 with conditional probabilities ( |+) or ( |\u2212) (Eq. 1.a-b). +) and (\u2212) are the overall probabilities of the test yielding a positive or negative result, 52 respectively. These tools can be extended to the somewhat counterintuitive situation where a 53 diagnostic test is conducted on a sample pooled from multiple individuals. The motivation for 54 sample pooling is to screen multiple patients simultaneously and reduce the burden on testing 55 facilities working with limited resources. Pooling schemes have been developed since their 56 introduction in the 1940s for syphilis testing, and have been applied to screen for and estimate 57 prevalence rates of a variety of diseases (20-24). Here, a simple two-step hierarchical protocol first 58 introduced by Dorfman is considered: Samples from patients are collected and randomly pooled 59 into groups of individual samples each. Pooled samples are interrogated with the diagnostic test. 60 If pooled testing yields a negative result, no further testing is conducted. If pooled testing yields a 61 positive result, all patients in that pool are tested individually. 62 While statistical approaches have been focused on characterizing the performance of various 63 pooling schemes, not all of them include non-ideal test parameters (25). Moreover, testing 64 characteristics at the pooled-and individual-sample levels can be different. Here, the Bayesian 65 inference approach in Eq. 1.a-b is modified to include differences in the assay sensitivity and 66 overall probability of a positive result in pooled vs. individual tests (Eq. S1-2). Sensitivity loss is 67 included as a reduction in the identification rate of pooled-sample tests by a scaling factor . Due to 68 the exceptional specificities of nucleic acid assays, the false positive rate is assumed to patients divided into sample pools of size , the average number of tests is 73 the number of initial pooled tests plus the expected number of follow-up tests (Eq. S4). Throughput 74 increase is expressed as the effective number of individuals screened by each diagnostic test (Eq. 75 S5). The individual-and pooled-sample test characteristics determine the pool size that optimizes 76 screening throughput as a function of average disease prevalence in the tested population. 77 The advantages of pooled-sample screening are discussed in the context of the rapidly evolving 78 COVID-19 pandemic (caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) (8, 26). A recent rRT-PCR 79 assay for COVID-19 reports an identification rate of 95% and no false positives after testing 310 80 samples including other respiratory pathogens (27). Given reported specificities of commercially-81 available respiratory panel assays (>99%), an estimated 1% false positive rate was included in the 82 model results reported here. A moderate reduction in the identification rate for a pooled sample 83 ( = 0.9) was assumed -this variable is discussed in detail below. Consistent with similar 84 implementations of Dorfman-type testing algorithms (28), substantial increases in testing 85 throughput are predicted for low disease prevalence rates ( ( ) \u22648%, Fig. 1), where throughput 86 more than doubles and optimal pool sizes are 4 \u2264 \u2264 12. At intermediate prevalence rates 0.1 \u2264 87 ( ) \u2264 0.2, the increase in throughput is moderate yet substantial (>30% increase in throughput) 88 and pool sizes are small ( = 3). For high prevalence rates, pooling yields no improvement 89(optimal pool size = 1). Average disease prevalence can be re-assessed as information is gained90    for the tested population to re-optimize pool size. Dynamic self-tuning is a feature of Bayesian 91 inference, a significant asset when a close feedback loop is desirable.",
