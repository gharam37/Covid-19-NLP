A pretested and validated questionnaire was used to collect the data. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 22. Results: Of 284 participants, 60.9% (n=173) had adequate knowledge of the preventive measures against COVID-19 infection. However, the overall practice of these preventive measures among the participants were poor as 69.7% of the participants were not practicing the preventive measures against the coronavirus. The determinants of poor practice of the preventive measures among the participants were being in age group 31-40 years (AOR=2.04, 95%CI: 1.26 -5.37, p=0.022), married (AOR=2.99, 95%CI: 1.40 -6.33, p=0.035) grandmultiparous (AOR=3.11, 95%CI: 1.32 -6.56, p=0.021), residing in rural area (AOR=2.08, 95%CI: 1.32 -4.05, p=0.031), and having no formal education (AOR=6.73, 95%CI: 2.66 -18.34, p=0.002).",

Deep sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus that was later named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 2 The infection has spread to over 110 countries including Nigeria prompting World health organization to declare it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 3 Globally, as of April 15, 2020, there have been 1,914,916 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 123,010 deaths, reported by WHO. 3 Nigeria Centre for Disease Control announced the first confirmed case of coronavirus disease in Nigeria on February 27, 2020 and since then many confirmed cases have been reported in many States across the country. 4 Early efforts have focused on describing the clinical characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 in the general population. 5 However, the disease appears to be particularly impactful in special populations that include those older than 65 years of age. 6 Pregnant women are also considered to be a special population group because of the unique 'immune suppression' caused by pregnancy. 7 The immunologic and physiologic changes of pregnancy might make pregnant women at higher risk of severe illness or mortality with Covid-19, compared with the general public. 6, 7 However, there is little information on Covid-19 infection during pregnancy.

This study is unique because it is the first study to describe the knowledge and adoption of preventive practices to protect pregnant mothers from coronavirus disease and its associated morbidity and mortality. In this study, the level of knowledge about preventive measures against coronavirus disease among the participants was high. This is probably because since the onset of the first confirmed case of the disease, Nigerian government have embarked on aggressive media campaign to educate the populace on the preventive measures to curtail person-to-person transmission of the disease. Therefore, it is not surprising that television and friends and relatives were the sources of information on the preventive measures for the majority of the study participants. Although, most of the study participants had adequate knowledge about the preventive measures to halt the spread of the disease, the level of practice of these preventive measures remained poor. This could be attributed to sociodemographic characteristics of the population in sub-Saharan African countries like Nigeria. High parity, rural residence, low educational attainment and occupations requiring physical contacts were the factors associated with poor practice of preventive measures against the disease. These factors increase pregnant women's risk of exposure and contracting coronavirus disease as it continued to spread in Nigeria.",
