Key uncertainties remain as to which 54 geographic factors drive local transmission dynamics and affect the intensity of transmission of COVID-55 19.

Epidemic intensity is minimized when incidence 58 is spread evenly across weeks and increases as incidence becomes more focused in particular days 59 ( Figure 1C , see a detailed description of how epidemic intensity is defined in Ref. 9 ).

Our 107 observation contrasts those expected from simple and classical epidemiological models where it would be 108 expected to see more intensity in crowded areas 22,23 . We hypothesize that the mechanism that underlies 109 the more crowded cities experience less intense outbreaks because crowding enables more widespread 110 and sustained transmission between households leading incidence to be more widely distributed in time 111 (see section below for detailed simulation, Methods). Population size, mean temperature, and mean 112 specific humidity were all significant but their correlation coefficients were much smaller (Extended 113 Data Table 1) . A multivariate-model was able to explain a large fraction of the variation in epidemic 114 intensity across Chinese cities (R 2 = 0.54). We perform sensitivity analysis to account for potential noise 115 in the city level incidence distribution (Extended Data Fig. 1) . 116 117 .

One key uncertainty in previous applications of models of epidemic intensity was the contribution of 127 disease importation(s) on the shape of the epidemic 9 . Due to the unprecedented scale of human mobility 128 restrictions imposed in China, the fact that the early epidemic was effectively from a single source, 129 coupled with the availability of real-time data on mobility, we can evaluate the impact of these 130 restrictions on the epidemic intensity relative to the local dynamics. To do so, we performed a univariate 131 analysis (Extended Data Table 1 ) and found that human mobility explained 14% of the variation in 132 epidemic intensity. This further supports earlier findings that COVID-19 had already spread throughout 133 much of China prior to the cordon sanitaire of Hubei province and that the pattern of seeding potentially 134 modulates epidemic intensity 6,24 . These findings are also in agreement with previous work on other 135 pathogens (measles, influenza) which showed that once local epidemics are established case importation 136 becomes less important in determining epidemic intensity 25 . 137 138 .

We found that peak incidence was correlated with epidemic 140 intensity (locations that had high intensity also had more cases at the peak). Total incidence, however, 141 was larger in areas with lower estimated intensity, which is intuitive as crowded areas have longer 142 epidemics that affect more people (Extended Data Table 2 ). This suggests that measures taken to 143 mitigate the epidemic may need to be enforced more strictly in smaller cities to lower the peak incidence 144 (flatten the curve) but conversely may not need to be implemented as long. Furthermore, with lower total 145 incidence in small cities, the risk of resurgence may be elevated due to lower population immunity. There 146 is urgent need to collect serological evidence to provide a full picture of attack rates across the world 26 . 147 148 Using our model trained on cities in China we extrapolated epidemic intensity to cities across the world 149 (Figure 3) . Figure 3 shows the distribution of epidemic intensity in 380 urban centers. Cities in yellow 150 are predicted to have higher epidemic intensity relative to those in blue (a full list is provided in 151 Extended Data Table 3 ). Small inland cities in sub-Saharan Africa had high predicted epidemic intensity 152 and may be particularly prone to experience large surge capacity in the public health system 27 . In general, 153 coastal cities had lower predicted intensity and larger and more prolonged predicted epidemics. Global 154 predictions of epidemic intensity in cities rely on fitted relationships of the first epidemic curve from 155",

To capture more realistic contact patterns, we created hierarchically-structured 169 populations 28 where individuals had high rates of contact within their households (households are defined 170 broadly and could represent care homes, hospitals, prisons, etc.), lower rates with individuals from other 171 households but within the same \"neighborhoods\", and relatively rare contact with other individuals in the 172 same prefecture (Figure 4A) . Assumptions are consistent with reports that the majority of onward 173 transmission occurred in households 2,29 . We assumed spread between prefectures was negligible once an 174 outbreak started. In this scenario, \"sparse\" prefectures often had more intense, short-term outbreaks that 175 were isolated to certain neighborhoods, while \"crowded\" prefectures could have drawn-out, low intensity 176 outbreaks that jumped between the more highly-connected \"neighborhoods\" (Figures 4B and C) . These 177 outbreaks had larger final size than those in less-crowded areas ( Figure 4C ) which likely is related to 178 large overdispersion in the reproduction number of COVID-19 30,31 where local outbreaks can reach their 179 full potential due to the availability of contacts. We also considered outbreak dynamics in sparse and 180 crowded prefectures under strong social distancing measures, which is likely to be the scenario occurring 181",
