The adoption of FIT in primary care has been slow, with notable variation in uptake and implementation across the UK (4). The Oxford University Hospitals Trust (OUH) adopted FIT prior to the DG30 guidance to comply with the 2015 NG12 NICE guidance for suspected cancer (6) , which recommended the use of faecal occult blood testing in symptomatic patients. This coincided with a desire from the clinical laboratory to move away from the comparatively inaccurate guaiac based method. FIT was commissioned by Oxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group (OCCG) as a direct access test for General Practitioners in 2016 following a study by this group comparing the accuracy of the guaiac and FIT methods in symptomatic primary care patients meeting NG12 criteria (5) .",

FIT testing, whether undertaken within a screening programme or applied to a symptomatic population, is dependent on the analytical performance of the laboratory procedures used. These analytical characteristics, most crucially sampling, impact on the way the results are most accurately reported (8) . Whilst there has been significant work undertaken in the context of screening (9) there is less data available in the symptomatic population. This is important to explore as the characteristics of the population for a screening programme, and the associated specimens, may differ from patients presenting with symptoms. For example, the age-range of the symptomatic population is broader and specimen characteristics, including faecal consistency, will likely differ in patients with changes in bowel habit, and the information and support for taking a sample is less. This may affect sample, and sampling integrity.",

Clinician advice from OUH and OCCG included guidance on delivering the sample to the laboratory on the same day as collection as Hb can degrade on storage (10) . On arrival in the laboratory the stool specimens were sampled using the Extel Hemo-Auto MC designed for application with the HM-JACKarc by laboratory staff competency assessed in this technique. The whole sampling procedure was undertaken in a fume cupboard by staff with standard laboratory protective equipment and involved a 30 second vortex mix which for most specimens was adequate for release of the faecal pellet collected into the dimples/grooves of the picker. All specimens were visually inspected to ensure complete suspension of specimen and if it was noted any residual specimen adherence mixing continued until all material was removed.",

LOD was calculated using the LOB + 1.645 (SD) of samples with \"very low concentrations\", considered to be those giving FIT results those between 0.5\u00b5g/g an 1.0 \u00b5g/g. LOQ was estimated from an imprecision profile constructed from faecal samples analysed in duplicate across a wide FIT concentration range of naturally Hb positive material and was taken as the concentration at which the percent coefficient of variation (%CV) was 10%. A 10%CV was selected as this has been recommended as an appropriate imprecision threshold for FIT method LOQ evaluation (7) . An additional within batch imprecision estimate was made using a dilution of the supplier's internal quality control (IQC) material. This was prepared to give a concentration near to the anticipated LOD to assess whether the behaviour of IQC material in the assay system with respect to imprecision was similar to true samples.",

A diluted IQC material at a concentration (1.5 \u00b5g/g) near to the LOD (1.1 \u00b5g/g) showed an imprecision of 33.9%, higher than the precision profile line of fit derived with clinical material but reflective of highly variable imprecision at these lower concentrations. The concentration of Hb present in the two IQC materials provided by the manufacturer, at around 25 \u00b5g/g and 95 \u00b5g/g. These were presumably selected to be clinically appropriate for use in screening programmes where decisions thresholds are higher. When the clinical interest shifts to lower concentrations, we would suggest a strategy of using IQC materials with values below and above 10 \u00b5g/g. Imprecision rises when faecal sampling is taken into consideration: average imprecision in homogenised specimens was 10.2% and in non-homogenised specimens was 27.8%, with upper estimates of 13.5% and 48.6%, respectively. Additionally, inconsistent classification was observed with respect to the 10 \u00b5g/g threshold in two further samples not assessed for imprecision due to some or all of the values being below the LOQ. This would suggest that Hb is not uniformly distributed in the faecal specimen, a finding consistent with other faecal constituents. For example, a 1 H NMR spectroscopy study of faeces (14) highlighted both heterogeneity and instability of a range of metabolic constituents. Also, whilst there is limited evidence to support the practice it is common for specimens for faecal elastase and calprotectin to include a homogenisation step prior to analysis. Future work must further establish the potential benefit of homogenisation in relation to FIT. We note that, in two specimens, one of the three non-homogenised results was positive compared with none in the homogenised specimens. This might lead to speculation that homogenisation leads to false negative results by reducing the amount of Hb to the average in the stool specimen. Neither of these patients have had a diagnosis of colorectal cancer, more than 1 year after the specimens were first obtained.",

Our analysis is limited in that the intervals between specimens are variable.

Sequential results of 400 \u00b5g/g were sometimes followed by <10 \u00b5g/g from the same patient taken a median of 6 days apart. It is not certain whether these differences are due to biological variation, inconsistent bleeding or sampling imprecision. A study (16) of the utility of two sample strategies for colorectal cancer in a symptomatic population it was noted that there was 39.2% nonconcordance between the first FIT result and the maximum FIT result. It would therefore appear that whatever strategy is used, bleeding from a lesion may be inconsistent and any single sample will, on average, detect with the same degree of diagnostic accuracy. Of note, previous studies of FIT in symptomatic patients have noted a small number of false negatives (4). In a recent study (17) using FIT in a symptomatic population in a 2 week wait pathway 12.5% of colorectal cancers were missed using a single patient collected specimen using a threshold of 10 \u00b5g/g. The method utilised was different from the one utilised in our laboratory study, the OC-SensorTM (Eiken Chemical Company, Tokyo, Japan) and had a reported detection limit of 4 \u00b5g/g. As with other studies it is not certain whether these false negative results were due to variable patterns of bleeding, poor sampling by the patient, or another cause. The study also noted that the majority of FIT results from patients with colorectal cancer had very high values (>150 \u00b5g/g) which would suggest these cases should be referred with higher priority.",

Given the high imprecision of analysis when sampling is taken into consideration we would caution against quantitative reporting of faecal Hb due to the high uncertainty of measurement. Further audit of larger datasets derived from symptomatic patients in routine clinical practice are required to provide evidence of the association between Hb concentration and clinical outcomes and to further inform qualitative reporting strategies. The binary nature of reporting that we suggest may make for more straightforward pathways for the triage of patients who have been deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic and require re-prioritisation into urgent and less urgent groups.",

This is demonstrable in the lack of verification data in native faecal material available from manufacturers supplying sampling devices. Existing data, depend upon synthetic material. It also presents challenges to laboratories with respect to both IQC and EQA. In our laboratory, we have commenced analysis of samples collected directly by patients into the collection device and noted that, despite collection guidance leaflets, a YouTube video and targeted training of staff advising patients, many samples arrive with faecal material clearly on the outside of the container and no specimen apparent in the buffer. Anecdotally, we have noted in many of the samples where sample integrity is questionable from visual inspection of the collection device, the patient is over 75 years of age.",

The dilutional effect of this will impact on quantitative measures and the lack of form will affect entrapment of the specimen itself in the manufacturer's collection device. We have noted a minority of specimens where considerably more than a 30 second vortex is required to suspend the faecal matter into the buffer. Protocols for how to manage these challenging specimens observed in the symptomatic population are lacking. Furthermore there is considerable concern about risk of faecal-oral or aerosol transmission of COVID-19 (19) and the risks of sample manipulation and the need for a period of very high throughput need to be balanced against analytic accuracy.",

However, there appear numerous sources of variability that require further investigation and optimisation. It is therefore important that all FIT studies identify the relative contributions of biological variation, sampling technique, Hb stability and method performance to false negative results as these are consistently observed in the literature. The high imprecision precludes reporting of quantitative FIT concentrations and on current analytical performance we consider a categorical approach, for example negative or positive relative to recommendation of a 2 week wait referral is more appropriate, potentially simplifying pathways to reprioritise patients with lower GI cancer symptoms who have had definitive diagnosis delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
