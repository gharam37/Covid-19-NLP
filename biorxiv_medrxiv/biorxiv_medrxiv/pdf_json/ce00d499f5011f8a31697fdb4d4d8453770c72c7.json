However, the speed at which the pandemic is unfolding poses an unprecedented challenge to collecting exposure data characterizing the full breadth of disease severity, hampering efforts to disseminate accurate information in a timely manner to impact public health planning and clinical management. Thus, there is an urgent need for an adaptable real-time data-capture platform to rapidly and 10 prospectively collect actionable high-quality data that encompasses the spectrum of subclinical and acute presentations while identifying disparities in diagnosis, treatment, and clinical outcomes. Addressing this priority will allow for more accurate estimates of disease incidence, inform risk mitigation strategies, more effectively allocate still-scarce testing resources, and allow for appropriate quarantine and treatment of those afflicted. 15 An evolving body of literature suggests COVID-19 incidence and outcomes vary according to age, sex, race/ethnicity, and underlying health status, with inconsistent evidence suggesting that commonly used medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazolidinediones (TZD), and ibuprofen may alter the natural disease course(3-9).",

Both are particularly advantageous when more than three-quarters of Americans are advised to physically distance(13). Such digital tools have 10 already been used in more controlled research settings which benefit from greater lead time for field testing, question curation, and recruitment. Although several digital collection tools for COVID-19 symptoms have been developed and launched in the U.S., including some in partnership with government health agencies such as the CDC, these applications have largely been configured to offer a single assessment of symptoms to tailor recommendations for further 15 evaluation. Alternatively, others have been developed for researchers to report patient-level information on behalf of participants already enrolled in clinical registries. While these approaches offer critical public health insights, they are not tailored for the type of scalable longitudinal data capture that epidemiologists need to perform comprehensive, well-powered investigations to address this public health crisis. 20 To meet this challenge, we established an international collaboration, the COronavirus Pandemic Epidemiology (COPE) consortium, comprised of leading investigators from several large clinical and epidemiological cohort studies.

By collecting participant-reported geospatial data, highlighted as a critical need for pandemic epidemiologic research (16), we can rapidly identify populations 5 with highly prevalent symptoms that may emerge as hot spots for outbreaks. A preliminary snapshot of the first 1.6 million users in the UK over the first five days of use confirms the variability in symptoms reported across suspected COVID-19 cases and is useful for generating and testing broader hypotheses. Users are a mean age of 41 with a range from 18 to 90 years, with 75% female users. Simple visualization of initial results (Fig. 3) demonstrates that among 10 those reporting symptoms by March 27, 2020 (n=265,851) the most common symptoms were fatigue and cough, followed by diarrhea, fever, and anosmia. Shortness of breath was relatively rarely reported. Only 0.2% (n=744) of individuals reporting possible COVID-19 symptoms reported receiving a qPCR test for COVID-19. Among individuals who did undergo a test, cough and fatigue alone or in combination commonly led to testing, but was not highly predictive of a 15 positive test. Similarly, no individuals reporting diarrhea in the absence of other symptoms tested positive. Interestingly, more complex presentations with cough and/or fatigue and at least one additional symptom, including less commonly appreciated symptoms such as diarrhea and anosmia, appeared to be better predictors. In particular, anosmia may be a more sensitive symptom as it was more common than fever in individuals who tested positive. In contrast, fever 20 alone was not particularly discriminatory. However, in combination with lesser appreciated symptoms, a greater frequency of positive tests was observed. These findings suggest that individuals with complex symptomatic presentation perhaps should be prioritized for testing.",

This example of real-time visualization of data captured by the COVID Symptoms Tracker may assist public health and government officials in reallocating resources, identifying areas with unmet testing needs, and detect emerging hot spots earlier.
