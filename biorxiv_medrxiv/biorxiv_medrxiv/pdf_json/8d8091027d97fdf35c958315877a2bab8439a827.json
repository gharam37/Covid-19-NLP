The modified model is employed to fit current covid-19 outbreak data in USA and to make predictions on the numbers of the infected, the removed and the death in the foreseeable future. Excellent fitting curves and regression quality are obtained, indicating that the model is working and the predictions may be close to reality. Our work could provide some ideas on what we may expect in the future and how we can prepare accordingly for this difficult period.",

            "text": "During this global pandemic outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (covid \u2212 19), USA becomes the number one in term of how many people are infected. What is going to happen next and how many people may be infected and may die become an emergent question for policy makers to make proper mitigation plans. Mathematical modeling and analysis of infectious disease transmissions [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] have been utilized to make predictions. Precise prediction remains challenging due to randomness of human interactions and unpredictability of virus growth patterns. Human mobility and virus transmissions, however, should follow basic physical and chemical laws. Two very powerful theories in physics and chemistry fields are the Eyring's rate process theory and the free volume concept. The Eyring's rate process theory 9 argues that every physical or chemical phenomenon is a rate controlled process, while the free volume concept [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] argues that the transmission speed is also dependent on the available free volume. Many seemingly unrelated systems or phenomena can be successfully described with these two theories, such as glass liquids 13 , colloids and polymers 15, 16 , granules [17] [18] [19] , electrical and proton conductivity 20,21 , superconductivity 22 , and Hall Effect 23 , etc. The infectious disease transmission phenomenon, a very complicated macroscopic process, could be properly analyzed with these two theories, too. Attempts were made to integrate these two theories together for modeling infectious disease transmissions under an assumption that an infectious disease transmission is a sequential chemical reaction 1 . Focus was placed on analyzing covid-19 outbreak in China for validating the newly formulated model and making predictions on peak time and peak infected.",

An infection peak against k 2 is observed, indicating that the recovery rate is important in disease transmission, which may flatten the infection at very early stages. For MSEIR model shown in Figure 2 (b), high infection rate indicated by k 4 means that the infection peaks at very early time and disappears quickly afterwards, possibly due to the fact that a large number of people are infected and \"herd immunity\" may be generated to stop further spreading.",

MSIR and MSEIR models give different predictions: MSIR model predicts that the infected will peak on August 20, 2020, with 4.75 million infected and 450000 death, while MSEIR model predicts that the infected will peak on May 6, 2020, with 850000 infected and 50000 death. The difference may be caused by the \"exposed\" category in MSEIR model, which may take a huge portion of the infected in MSIR model. The death rate predicted with MSEIR model, 5.9%, is more close to current data, implying that the prediction made with MSEIR model may be more realistic than that with MSIR model. The infection peak time is strongly dependent on the stretched exponential parameter \u03b2, which substantially amplifies peak heights. Large values of \u03b2 mean that more people will be infected. For all regressions, the parameter \u03b2 is less than 0.2, indicating that the interpersonal transmission is in a \"weak\" point and the \"stay at home\" isolation and travel",

The death rate predicted with MSEIR model is more close to current death rate in USA, about 3.9 %.In summary, under the assumption that human movement energy may change with time during disease transmission period, we have modified the previous infection disease model formulated on the basis of the Eyring's rate process theory and free volume concept 1 . Under such an approach, the model used in infectious disease transmission is consistent with the ones used in my previous publication for other systems. Treatment method is thus unified across different fields. Obtained equations fit the data very well with R 2 large than 0.99 for 11 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
