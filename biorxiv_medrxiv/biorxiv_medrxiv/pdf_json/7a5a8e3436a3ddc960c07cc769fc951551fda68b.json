If interventions are triggered at the same time across all locations, they may arrive too early in some locations and too late in others. We therefore estimated the impact of triggering interventions at different times, both nationally and at a local level. We projected that triggering interventions locally instead of nationally could modestly reduce the total number of cases and deaths, as well as reduce peak demands on the healthcare system ( Fig. 3a, b ; Table S3 ). However, our simulations do not account for any differences in the implementation of or adherence to control measures which might arise from these timings varying in different parts of the country. Examining the simulated dynamics at a county level ( Fig. 3c ) shows that the timing of local epidemics may vary among counties, and highlights that epidemics at a local level are predicted to peak more sharply than they do across the entire UK.",

By analysing the total attendance at spectator sports in the UK, we performed additional simulations to evaluate the potential impact of such restrictions ( Fig.  4a, Table S2 ). Although yearly attendance at sporting events is high (75.1 million spectators per year [21] ), even if we assume that people make the equivalent of their mean daily physical contacts at such events (i.e. 5 contacts per person, to make a total of 375 million), this number is very low relative to the number of yearly contacts which occur outside the context of sporting events (269 billion [12] ). We estimated that stopping spectator sports would have little direct effect on the number of cases ( Fig. 4a, Table S4 ). We simulated a more general reduction in leisure contacts-which mainly occur in pubs, bars, restaurants and cinemas-by reducing leisure contacts by 75%, and found a larger (though still modest) impact on the epidemic.

Because the model does not explicitly structure individuals by household, we are unable to evaluate the impact of measures based on household contacts, e.g. household quarantine, i.e., where all members of a household with a suspected COVID-19 case remain in isolation. Such contact-targeted measures could increase the impact of a package of interventions by limiting spread in the community. However, the presence of asymptomatic infections [23] means that isolation based on symptomatic case identification would be unlikely to fully prevent ongoing transmission. We also do not include individual level variation in transmission (i.e. 'superspreading events', [24] ). There are several examples of such events for COVID-19 [25] , and individual-level variation is likely important in influencing the success of control measures in the very early stages of an outbreak [5] . However, as outbreaks of directly-transmitted infections become larger, the population-level dynamics will predominantly be driven by the average mixing pattern between key epidemiological groups, particularly between different ages [11, 26] . We therefore used a stochastic model implementation to capture variation in these population-level dynamics. We also assumed that subclinically-infected individuals were 50% as infectious as clinical cases. A study of 2,147 close contacts in Ningbo, China estimated that the mean onward transmission from asymptomatic infections was 65% (95% HDI: 20-120%) that of symptomatic cases [23] . However, symptomatic cases were found to be more likely to generate new symptomatic infections compared to asymptomatic infections. This suggests that the overall relative contribution of asymptomatic individuals to new infections may be lower than 65%, and hence 50% is a plausible assumption. We used mixing matrices for the UK measured in 2006 [12] , and changes in contact patterns since then may alter the potential effect of interventions. The fractions of hospitalisation, ICU use, and death are estimated using data from China, and any differences in UK populations could affect our estimates of health care demand.",
