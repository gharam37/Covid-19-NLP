It is important for any N95 reuse strategy to determine the effects that proposed protocols would have on the physical functioning of the mask, as well as the practical aspects of implementation. Here we propose and implement a method of heating N95 respirators with moisture (85 o C, 60-85% humidity). We test both mask filtration efficiency and fit to validate this process. Our tests focus on the 3M 1860 and 3M 8210 Plus N95 models. After five cycles of the heating procedure, both respirators pass quantitative fit testing (score of >100) and show no degradation of mask filtration efficiency. We also test the Chen Heng V9501 KN95 and HKYQ N95 finding no degradation of mask filtration efficiency, however even for unheated masks these scored <50 for every fit test. The heating method presented here is scalable from individual masks to over a thousand a day with a single industrial convection oven, making this method practical for local application inside health-care facilities.",

            "text": "While N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) were made for single use operation, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused a shortage worldwide of these masks. COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been shown to be very contagious and spread through aerosolized droplets. These fine droplets can remain in the air, increasing the risk of contagion to those nearby [1, 2] . This is particularly risky to healthcare workers who work with Covid patients. In order for an N95 mask to be reused more safely, the mask should be decontaminated of SARS-CoV-2 while maintaining its filtration efficiency and fit factor [3, 4] . Currently, limited information is known about SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. The addition of moisture possibly plays a role in the inactivation of some viruses [5] [6] [7] . A study found viral inactivation in 70 o C for 5 minutes [8] while in a buffered solution. SARS-CoV-2 has also been shown to be inactivated at temperatures of 60-75 o C for 5-30 minutes in various liquid media [9] [10] [11] . Other enveloped viruses, such as H1N1 and H5N1 Influenza strains have been shown to be inactivated with moist heat at 65 o C and over 50% humidity [5] [6] [7] . These studies also found that dry heat alone was not enough to deactivate H1N1. While previous studies have looked at the effects of moist heat on N95 FFRs, these were done at substantially lower temperatures of 60-65 o C [5, 7, 12, 13] . We also note that recent CDC guidelines have indicated that moist heat is a reasonable method for reusing N95 FFRs. The resistance of Clostridium difficile (C. diff.) at elevated temperature and moisture was also studied and found temperatures Figure. 1 Figure 1 (a) Each N95 FFR (1) was placed into a plastic container with a paper towel (2) with 500 uL of water. Both the mask (3) and container (4) were labeled with a Sharpie black permanent ink marker, which would allow the mask to be identified by the correct healthcare worker and avoid cross contamination. (b) For testing purposes, the lid of each container was modified to have a temperature and humidity sensor (STH30).",

Here we present a scalable method of heating N95 FFRs to 85 o C, in air, with 60-80% humidity. We note that during the preparation of this manuscript, another study (with some shared co-authors) was posted on medRxiv on the filtration effects of heating under various humidity conditions and for multiple cycles of mask reuse [15] . N95 respirators are typically made of meltblown polypropylene fabric. While this naturally filters out large particles, the efficient filtration of sub-micron sized particles is due electrostatic charge that is created in the mask fabrication process. If this charge is removed, the mask efficiency plummets, even if there are no visual signs of degradation to the mask. Thus it is critical to run filtration tests on any decontamination procedure.",

We found in our tests that the rigid container is preferable to a bag as it ensures constant volume, leading to a constant humidity and provides protection to the mask in the handling process. In each container is added a small (2.5\"x2.5\") paper towel (2-ply), which is wetted with 500(+/-40) uL of water. The containers are sealed by placing the cover on and then placed in a convection oven (Despatch LAC1-38-8, 3.7 cu. Ft.). We note that a convection oven produces a stable and uniform temperature throughout the oven, as well as heats the masks and containers quickly due to the driven warm airflow. We find that the measured oven temperature is stable to less than 1 o C regardless of the number of containers we place into this oven (1-45 containers), Figure 2 . It is important to .

For testing purposes, the lids of the containers were modified to allow a temperature and humidity sensor (SHT30 DFR0588) inside. We found that the humidity will drop rapidly in the presence of a small hole in the lid. The gap between the wires and the lid were thus sealed with 10 minute epoxy with a working temperature of 93 o C. For temperature verification, we also used both a K type thermocouple (readout with a SR630) and an IR thermometer (Fluke 561). Figure 3 shows the humidity as a function of time within each container as well as the variability of humidity on the volume of water added. We find that 500 uL is the optimal amount of water for the 1.25 qt. container. We also find that the humidity takes between 10-15 minutes to reach the 60% level. This is an important consideration when applying this method as at least 10 additional minutes should be added to the heating cycle to achieve the desired time at target humidity.
