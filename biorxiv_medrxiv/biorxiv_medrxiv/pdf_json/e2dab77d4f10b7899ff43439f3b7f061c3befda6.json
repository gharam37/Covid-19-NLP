It is approved by the Food and Drug Association for CRS induced by chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapies and immunemediated rheumatic diseases. 21, 22 Exploratory studies have suggested that IL-6 inhibition may be beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19 and, despite the absence of definitive evidence, very high drug cost, and unclear potential for harm, it has already been incorporated into COVID-19 management guidelines generated in China and Italy. 23, 24 This may thus incite clinical use without definitive evidence supporting its safety in COVID-19. We therefore designed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence describing IL-6 response in patients with COVID-19 and the existing and planned studies investigating the efficacy of tocilizumab to guide patient management, clarify guideline development, and inform future trials in this field.",

This clinical phenotype resembles that of CRS, a condition for which IL-6 receptor inhibition with tocilizumab has clearly demonstrated benefit21 and may represent a more severely affected COVID-19 subpopulation, with increased requirements for critical care and worse clinical outcomes.47The results of the preliminary investigation of tocilizumab in severe COVID-19 are promising, but also suffer from important limitations.43 In patients receiving tocilizumab, all experienced rapid resolution of fever, symptomatic improvement, and the majority had early reductions in oxygen requirements and radiographic abnormalities. In contrast to other cohorts, which have demonstrated mortality rates of up to 61.5% amongst critically ill patients (and the pooled mortality of 22% among all hospitalized patients seen in our meta-analysis), no patients died in this study after administration of tocilizumab.48 Further, despite intensive immunosuppression, no patients developed superimposed nosocomial pulmonary infections nor significant adverse drug reactions. This study is limited by its small sample size, non-randomised intervention, lack of comparator arm, and retrospective design, but the results are biologically plausible as the included patients all had elevated IL-6 levels which decreased progressively in parallel to clinical and radiographical improvement.43Despite these early signals of benefit, the results of several ongoing clinical studies should be awaited to better define the role of tocilizumab in the therapy of COVID-19.49-53 Such studies benefit from larger sample sizes, prospective recruitment of patients with a wide spectrum of disease severity, and in some protocols, the use of active controls.
