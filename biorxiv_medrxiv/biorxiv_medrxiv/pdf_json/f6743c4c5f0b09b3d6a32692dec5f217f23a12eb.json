A side effect of this reduction, however, is that the duration of the epidemic outbreak increases significantly. The dependence of the peak infected fraction and the time to reach maximum infection are shown in Fig. 1(b) . For example, starting with a reference value R 0 = 2.4, the time to peak infection is around 65 days. Reducing R 0 to 1.2, extends the time to peak infection to \u223c 320 days, while the maximum infected fraction is reduced from \u223c 22% to \u223c 1.5% and the total infected by the end of the epidemic decreases from \u223c 90% to \u223c 30%.

An essential feature of the COVID-19 infections is that it produces relatively mild symptoms in the majority of the population, while it can also lead to serious respiratory problems mainly in the older population (> 70), or in individuals with pre-existing chronic diseases [6] . For example, the hospitalization rate of the symptomatic cases in the 20\u221229 age group is 1.2% out of which 5% requires critical care and 0.03% of the infections lead to death [7] . In contrast, for the 70 \u2212 79 age group hospitalization rate is 24.3% out of which 43.2% is critical and the fatality ratio of the infected is 5.1%. Although the transition between these extremes is gradual, a fairly sharp transition takes place around the age of 65. In addition to age, pre-existing chronic diseases is an additional criteria for identifying a vulnerable group in the population. Based on the limited currently available data around 97 \u2212 99% of deaths due to COVID-19 already had underlying chronic diseases, which is of course very common in the older age groups.",

While social distancing aims to reduce the total infected population by decreasing R 0 , this model helps to evaluate alternative or complementary measures targeting the reduction of parameter \u00b5 by isolating/shielding the vulnerable population from the infections. This could be achieved by clearly differentiated measures targeted to the high-risk group: restricting mobility, providing free homedelivery of food and medication, increased support addressing communication and healthcare needs, and providing separated living space where needed. Since the isolation strategy targets a subpopulation, a radical isolation is likely to be more effective than uniform social distancing, and at a smaller cost for the economy and for the general functioning of the society. Our model allows the comparison of general social distancing affecting both k and \u00b5 (represented by the diagonal arrow in Fig. 2(c) ) and targeted isolation affecting \u00b5 only (vertical arrow in Fig. 2(c) ). The overall fatality of the pandemic is primarily driven by the size of the infected vulnerable population, \u00b5I total . Depending on the epidemiological situation, the public response should be a mixture of the two efforts. For low values of R 0 , general social distancing is more effective and has the potential to suppress the epidemic. At higher R 0 values, however, the optimal public response should focus more heavily on isolation of the vulnerable population. With limited resources available, when the strategy is primarily based on drastic targeted isolation over a shorter time, the end result is a collectively immune population resistant to further infections (\"herd immunity\"). It is also apparent that the integral in Equation (3) can be reduced by decreasing \u00b5 in a timedependent manner. This can be achieved by monitoring the progression of the infection I(t) via statistically representative testing of different regions and cities, and intensifying/relaxing the isolation of the vulnerable population accordingly.",

By the end of the epidemic, this results in I total \u223c 0.6 within the low-risk population so the immunity in the total population is 45%. Assuming that after the epidemic the transmission rate increases back to R 0 = 2.4, the minimum immune fraction needed for herd immunity is around 60%.

At the time of writing, certain countries follow various combinations of social distancing and isolation. In Sweden, only moderate social distancing is implemented which will likely lead to development of immunity in the population. This strategy, however, without introducing targeted measures to protect the vulnerable population may lead to high mortality and over-saturation of the health care system. Italy and Spain, on the other hand implemented severe social distancing, but so far this seems to be unable to stop the progress of the epidemic and may in fact be on track towards achieving large scale infection and immunity in the population. However, with too much focus on the implementation of uniform social distancing and no clear targeted measures for identifying and efficiently protecting the vulnerable sub-population can lead to a scenario with high mortality in spite of the high social and economic costs of an extended and potentially recurrent epidemic. Another interesting observation is the striking difference between the mortality within the confirmed infected patients in Italy (\u223c 10%) compared to Germany (\u223c 1%). While there can be multiple reasons for this difference, it is possible that the closer social and family interactions between the older and younger generations in Italy, corresponds to a higher baseline value of \u00b5, and/or the current exposure of the disease targets mainly the younger population in Germany with policies in place to decrease the exposure of the vulnerable population.",
