To address this need, we developed a framework that can be used to design and interpret serological studies, with applicability to SARS-CoV-2. Starting with results from a serological survey of a given size and age stratification, the framework incorporates the test's sensitivity and specificity and enables estimates of population seroprevalence that include uncertainty. These estimates can then be used in models of disease spread to calculate the effective reproductive number R eff , the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 under partial immunity, to forecast disease dynamics, and to assess the impact of candidate public health and clinical interventions. Similarly, starting with a pre-specified tolerance for uncertainty in seroprevalence estimates, the framework can be used to define the sample size needed. This framework can be used in conjunction with any model, including ODE models (3, 4), agent-based simulations (5), or network simulations (6), and can be used to estimate R eff or to simulate transmission dynamics.",

Serological tests that identify past infection can be used to estimate cumulative incidence, but the relative accuracy and robustness of various sampling strategies has been unclear. Here, we used a flexible framework that integrates uncertainty from test characteristics, sample size, and heterogeneity in seroprevalence across tested subpopulations to compare estimates from sampling schemes. Using the same framework and making the assumption that serological positivity indicates immune protection, we propagated these estimates and uncertainty through dynamical models to assess the uncertainty in the epidemiological parameters needed to evaluate public health interventions. We examined the relative accuracy of convenience samples versus structured surveys to estimate population seroprevalence, and found that sampling schemes informed by demographics and contact networks outperform uniform sampling. The framework can be adapted to optimize the design of serological surveys given particular test characteristics and capacity, population demography, sampling strategy, and modeling approach, and can be tailored to support decision-making around introducing or removing interventions.",

Assessment of population seropositivity, a measure of the prevalence of individuals who have been infected in the past and developed antibodies to the virus, can address gaps in knowledge of the cumulative disease incidence. This is particularly important given inadequate viral diagnostic testing and incomplete understanding of the rates of mild and asymptomatic infections (1) . In this context, serological surveillance has the potential to provide information about the true number of infections, allowing for robust estimates of case and infection fatality rates and for the parameterization of epidemiological models to evaluate the possible impacts of specific interventions and thus guide public health decision-making.",

First, tests may have imperfect sensitivity and specificity; estimates for COVID-19 tests on the market as of April 2020 reported specificity between 95% and 100% and sensitivity between 62% and 97% (Supplementary Table S1 ). Second, the population sampled will likely not be a representative random sample, particularly in the first rounds of testing, when there is urgency to test using convenience samples and potentially limited serological testing capacity. 3 Test sensitivity/specificity, sampling bias, and true seroprevalence influence the accuracy and robustness of estimates. To integrate uncertainty arising from test sensitivity and specificity, we produced a Bayesian posterior distribution of seroprevalence that accommodates uncertainty associated with a finite sample size ( Fig. 1; green annotations) . We denote the posterior probability that the true population serology is equal to \u03b8, given test outcome data X and test sensitivity and specificity characteristics, as Pr(\u03b8 | X). Because sample size and outcomes are included in X, and because test sensitivity and specificity are included in the calculations, this posterior distribution over \u03b8 appropriately handles uncertainty (see Methods).",

As a natural extension to use of serological data to estimate core epidemiological quantities (11-13) or to map out patterns of outbreak risk (14), the posterior distribution of seroprevalence can be used as an input to any epidemiological model, including a typical SEIR model (3), where the proportion seropositive may correspond to the recovered/immune compartment, or a more complex framework such as an age-structured SEIR model incorporating interventions like closing schools and social distancing (10,15) ( Fig. 1 ; blue annotations). We integrated uncertainty in the posterior estimates of seroprevalence and uncertainty in model dynamics or parameters using Monte Carlo sampling to produce a posterior distribution of trajectories or key epidemiological parameter estimates ( Fig. 1 ; black annotations). Figure 4 illustrates how estimates of the height and timing of peak infections varied under two serological sampling scenarios and two hypothetical social distancing policies for a basic SEIR framework parameterized using seroprevalence data. Uncertainty in seroprevalence estimates propagated through SEIR model outputs in stages: larger sample sizes at a given seroprevalence resulted in a smaller credible interval for the seroprevalence estimate, which improved the precision of estimates of both the height and timing of the epidemic peak. In this case, we assumed the same serological test sensitivity and specificity as before (93% and 97.5%, respectively), but test characteristics also impacted model estimates, with more specific and sensitive tests leading to more precise estimates ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). Even estimations from a perfect test carried uncertainty, which corresponds to the size of the sample set ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ).",

Importantly, because the relative importance of subpopulations in a model may vary based on the hypothetical interventions being modeled (e.g., the re-opening of workplaces would place higher importance on the serological status of working-age adults), MDI sample allocation recommendations may have to be derived for multiple hypothetical interventions and then averaged to design a study from which the largest variety of high-confidence results can be derived.

As a result, convenience samples, such as newborn heel stick dried blood spots or samples from blood donors, can be used to estimate population seroprevalence. However, it is important to note that in the absence of reliable assessment of correlations in seroprevalence across age groups, extrapolations from these convenience samples may be misleading as sample size increases (Supplementary Figs.

Because H t = i h t i , and because the values h t i are all functions of a random variable \u03b8, H t is also a random variable. Our goal is to minimize its variance by strategically allocating finite samples in order to minimize the important posterior variances among the elements of \u03b8. In plain language, some of the subpopulations are more important in shaping future disease dynamics than others, so MDI will preferentially allocate more samples to those subpopulations in a principled manner, 1 The next generation matrix N is non-negative and satisfies the conditions of the Perron-Frobenius theorem which means that it has a largest eigenvalue \u03bb-for a next generation matrix, R 0 = \u03bb-which is greater than or equal to all other eigenvalues, with a corresponding eigenvector x of non-negative components. This means that repeated applications of N to any initial vector that is not orthogonal to x will become increasingly parallel to x at a rate of \u03bb/|\u03bb 2 | per iteration, where \u03bb 2 is the second largest eigenvalue of N . This is the basis of the so-called Power Method which repeatedly applies the matrix to find the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector.",

Uncertainty is mitigated but not eliminated in the n = 1000 scenario, just as uncertainty is mitigated but not eliminated using a perfect serological test. Boxplots reflect 100 samples from SEIR dynamimcs; whiskers span 1.5\u00d7IQR, boxes span central quartile, lines indicate medians, and outliers not shown. See Methods for SEIR simulation details and parameters.",
