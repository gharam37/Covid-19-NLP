The over-activated inflammatory immune 53 response was attenuated after Tocilizumab treatment, yet immune cells including 54 plasma B cells and CD8 + T cells still exhibited an intense humoral and cell-mediated 55 anti-virus immune response in recovered COVID-19 patients.

Recent studies have 211 illustrated that monocytes may be the main cause of exacerbation and even death of 212 COVID-19 patients through inflammatory storms 4 . In this study, we discovered a 213 specific monocyte subpopulation that may lead to the inflammatory storm in patients214 at severe stage through single-cell mRNA sequencing. By analyzing the monocyte-215 centric ligand/receptor interactions, we revealed a severe stage-specific landscape of 216 peripheral immune cell communication that may drive the inflammatory storm in 217 COVID-19 patients. With that we obtained a list of cytokine storm relevant 218 ligand/receptors that can serve as candidate drug targets to treat the disease, and 219 provided mechanistic insights of the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. 220 There are always questions about whether Tocilizumab treatment may affect the 221 antiviral effect of the body 22,23 . Our single cell profiles illustrated a sustained humoral 222 and cell-mediated anti-virus immune response of COVID-19 patients at both severe and 223 recovery stage. For example, the proportion of plasma B cells with antibody-secreting 224 function were keeping at high levels and the cytotoxicity and cytokine production of 225 effector CD8 + T cells were also remained stable in severe COVID-19 patients after 226 Tocilizumab treatment. 227The distributions of NK cells were significantly different in the two patients 228 (ExtendedData Fig.1b), and the analysis of gene expression differences did not enrich 229 significant biological functions, therefore we did not discuss them in depth. The normal 230 functions of other cell types, such as \u03b3\u03b4T cells and DCs, were almost lost under severe 231 conditions, and the contribution of these cells to the progression of the disease requires 232 further investigation. 233 234 author/funder.
