As of 4 th April 2020, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infection has reached over 45 1.05 million cases globally, claiming 56,985 lives (Coronavirus disease 2019, Situation Report-15, WHO). Most 46 concerning is that this number is predicted to continue rising significantly in the next couple of months. Scientists have 47 been working round the clock to understand how the virus spreads and evolves. There is an imminent challenge to develop 48 effective approaches to contain the rapid spread of this pathogen. 49 50 In addition to the traditional control methods, such as travel ban and house isolation, which have clear negative impact on 51 economy and disrupt normal social activities, the development of antiviral drugs and vaccine should be the ultimate solution 52 to contain the epidemic and reduce the fatality (1, 2). Similar to other SARS-like CoVs (3, 4), SARS-CoV-2 uses its spike 53 (S) protein to bind and invade human cells (5, 6). The S protein and its host receptor are the key targets for drug design and 54 vaccine development (7, 8) . Recently, several 3D protein structures of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-55 2 spike protein have been determined (5, 6, 9) . The structural basis of receptor recognition by SARS-CoV-2 has become 56 clear (6, 9) . This laid the foundation for future vaccine development. 57 58 Vaccine utilizes the human immune system and is specific to the viral-encoded peptides (10). One of the major concerns 59 for antiviral vaccine development is the constant emergence of new mutations, which may make vaccine not effective for 60 future epidemic (7, 10). A prominent example is that, new Influenza viruses arise every year, requiring new immunization 61 (11). SARS-CoV-2 belong to the single-stranded RNA virus, whose genome can readily mutate as virus spreads (12, 13) . 62",

However, these results may be based on 65 limited genomic data in the early stage of virus development. It is critical to study and monitor the mutation dynamics of 66 SARS-COV-2. 67 68 Taking advantage of the increasing amount of genomic data collected around the world, we set to explore the current status 69 of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity, assess the mutation rate, and potentially identify the emergence of novel mutations that 70 .

Based on the determined CoV2_RBD-ACE2 complex structure, 408R is located at the interface 209 between RBD and ACE2, but is positioned relatively far away from ACE2, thus does not have direct interaction with ACE2 210 ( Figure 4B) . However, the determined RBD0-ACE2 structure showed that 408R forms a hydrogen bond (3.3 \u00c5 in length) 211 with the glycan attached to 90N from ACE2 ( Figure 4C ) (6). The hydrogen bond may have contributed to the exceptionally 212 higher ACE2 binding affinity. In contrast, despite this arginine residue is also conserved in human SARS-CoV 213 (corresponding to 395R in PDB: 2AJF), it is positioned relatively distant (6.1 \u00c5) from the glycan bound to 90N from ACE2 214 ( Figure S1) .

Due to the short time space of sample collection and a relatively low mutation rate for SARS-CoV-2, we believe 241 that a Minimum Evolution phylogeny may outperform other phylogenetic methods to achieve this aim. As expected, the 242 earliest few reported SARS-CoV-2 accessions collected from Wuhan China were identified at the center of the phylogenetic 243 tree with the shortest branch. Interestingly, a number of virus genomes from USA were found almost identical to these 244 putative original versions of virus from Wuhan. However, according to public media, the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in USA 245 occurred relatively later than other countries. One possible explanation for this observation is that, the spread of SARS-246",

In addition, one of the three samples collected from 255 the cruise ship stranded in Japan was found closely related to a sample collected from Guangzhou, China, whilst the other 256 two were grouped with several cases from USA. Noteworthy, out phylogeny seems to support the presence of two major 257 types of SARS-CoV-2 in the target samples, suggesting the potential existence of two spread sources. Interestingly, this 258 speculation is corroborated by an independent clustering analyses using different phylogeny method (20). 259 260 Until now, the origin of SARS-CoV-2, and how it has been transmitted to human remains largely a mystery. Early genomic 261 data proved that human SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, and single-stranded RNA virus in the subgenus 262Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus (13, 14) . Evolutionarily, SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to bat SARS-like 263CoV (88% genome sequence identity) and human SARS CoV (79%), the latter of which has caused world pandemic in 264 2003 (13). Based on the strong genome sequence identity between SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARS-like COVs, it was initially 265 speculated that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from bat (14, 21). However, a more recent study proposed that pangolin 266 may be the most likely reservoir hosts due to the identification of closely related SARS-COVs from this species as well 267 (22). Both of these two animals can harbor coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2. However, direct evidence of the 268 transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from either bat or pangolin to human is still missing. 269 270 Prior to this study, several publications have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from the genome 271 recombination of SARS-like CoVs from different animal hosts, as evidenced by the discrepant clustering patterns for the 272 phylogenies using different genetic regions. Lu (13) first observed that the RBD of S protein in SARS-CoV-2 is more 273 closely related to human SARS-CoV, whilst the other part of its genome is more similar to bat SARS-CoV. Later Peng (23) 274 identified a bat CoV_RaTG13 and several pangolin SARS-CoVs that are consistently closer to SARS-CoV-2 than human 275 SARS-CoV in either full-S protein or RBD. By combining the data from these two studies, our study confirmed the 276 observations reported in both studies, and further determined that the S protein recombination actually happened between 277 human SARS-CoV and a bat SARS-CoV, much earlier before its transmission to human, with the newly identified bat 278 SARS-CoV-RaTG13 as an intermediate. 279.

            "text": "Another notable finding in this study corresponds to the identification of an amino acid mutation in the RBD of S protein 281 in SARS-CoV-2. Mostly importantly, we showed that this amino acid mutation is very likely to cause a reduced binding 282 affinity to human ACE2 receptor. The RBD of S protein binds to a receptor in host cells, and is responsible for the first 283 step of CoV infection. The receptor binding affinity of RBD directly affects virus transmission rate. Thus, it has been the 284 major target for antiviral vaccine and therapeutic development such as SARS (8). Despite the S protein gene seems to be 285 more conserved than the other protein-encoding genes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, our study provide direct evidences 286 that a mutated version of SARS-CoV-2 S protein with varied transmission rate may have already emerged. Based on the 287 close relationship of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS, current vaccine and drug development for SARS-CoV-2 has also focused on 288 the S protein and its human binding receptor ACE2 (7, 24). Thus, the observation in this study raised the alarm that SARS-289CoV-2 mutation with varied epitope profile could arise at any time, which means current vaccine development against 290 SARS-CoV-2 is at great risk of becoming futile. Because the receptor recognition mechanism seems to be highly conserved 291 between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which have been proved to share the common human cell receptor ACE2. One 292 suggestion for the next step of therapeutic development is probably to focus on the identification of potential human ACE2 293 receptor blocker, as suggested in a recent commentary (7).
