We aimed to address this limitation in a systematic review and 26 meta-analysis and to examine the clinical, biochemical and radiological risk factors in a meta-27 regression. 28 Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed. PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were 29 searched using pre-specified keywords on March 07, 2020. Peer-reviewed empirical studies 30 examining rates of severe illness, critical illness and case fatality among COVID-19 patients 31 were examined. Numerators and denominators to compute the prevalence rates and risk factors 32 were extracted. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed. Results were corrected for 33 publication bias. Meta-regression analyses examined the moderator effects of potential risk 34 factors. 35 Results: The meta-analysis included 29 studies representing 2,090 individuals. Pooled rates of 36",

Despite the large number of articles that were reviewed, our 241 quantitative synthesis was limited to 29 studies representing data of 2,090 individuals. Our 242 literature-based estimates of severe illness, critical illness and case fatality rates among patients 243 with COVID-19 were 15%, 5% and 0.8% respectively. After adjusting for underreporting and 244 publication bias, COVID-19-associated prevalence of severe illness, critical illness and case 245 fatality increased to 26%, 16% and 7.4% respectively. 246 Our unadjusted random-effects estimates of severe illness requiring hospitalization (15%) 247 and critical illness requiring intensive care admission (5%), are consistent with the estimates of 248 COVID-19-associated morbidity based on large individual-level datasets. 21 As such, the 249 unadjusted findings of our meta-analysis regarding severity of illness corroborate the inferences 250 made based on current surveillance systems. However, the unadjusted mortality rate observed in 251 our analysis (0.8%, 95% CI, 0.2%-2.9%) is lower than the COVID-19-associated mortality rates 252 in China (3.6%) or globally (3.4%) at the end of February, 2020 (i.e. the time represented in the 253 reviewed publications). 22 254 As we have noted in the introduction, retrospective patient data and the literature derived 255 from such data could be systematically biased towards both overestimating and / or 256 underestimating morbidity and mortality. The reviewed studies are largely representing tertiary 257 care settings, of which the capacity may have been overridden minimally, if at all, despite the 258 high reproductive number (R0) at the time of sampling.
