These fit testing methods have utilized mannequin heads, and have used a small number of fit tests (usually 3) compared to the OSHA testing protocol for human fit testing (8 tests) . This is due to the fact that mannequin heads do not move. Humans model fit testing involves 8 tests, including: 1) normal breathing, 2) deep breathing, 3) turning the head left-to-right, 4) moving the head up-and-down, 5) talking, 6) grimacing, 7) bending over, and 8) normal breathing. Therefore, to our knowledge, there have not been any studies that have measured quantitative fit testing on heat-and UVGI-disinfected treated masks using a human model on the OSHA protocol. This would be the most accurate method to predict the fit performance of a mask on health care workers after disinfection. As authors of previous mannequin-based studies have stated as limitations of their studies, \"These results should not be interpreted as being equivalent to a standard OSHAaccepted fit test method 11 Human subject testing is needed to truly assess respirator fit.\"",

A test probe was inserted into disposable N95 respirators according to the make and model of the respirator. For proper fit testing, the probe was inserted into the \"breathing zone\" of the respirator where it would not be blocked by the person's nose or chin ( Figure  4 ). For the KN95 respirator (4C Air, Sunnyvale, CA) this was located to the left of the fold and for the 3M 8210 Plus respirator (3M, St. Paul, Minnesota) this was located above the fold ( Figure 5 -6). : Sample probes were placed in disposable N95 masks in the \"breathing zone\" of the respirator according to the specific make and model of the mask so that the probe would not be blocked by the person's chin or nose.

Association between treatment method and overall fit factor was tested using a one-way ANOVA procedure (a=0.05). The final set of analyses used independent sample t-tests (a=0.05) to test the individual post-hoc associations between treatment types for significance, using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (false discovery rate of 0.25) to control for multiple comparisons.

There are four areas which merit further consideration. Will (75\u00b0C Hot Air (30 mins) for 10 cycles) and UVGI = UV (254 nm, 8W, (30 min) for 10 cycles) decontamination harm the fit of other N95 mask models? Can the method of decontamination work through all the layers of trapped virus in the particles? Will turning the mask as required in UVGI testing expose the cleaner or user to additional infection risk? These tests need to be performed with the Covid19 virus. Our group and other excellent and resourceful scientists around the world are addressing these important and pressing questions.",

There was a significant effect between UV treatment for the ten UV-treated masks (M = 43.3, SD = 65.44) in comparison to the ten untreated masks in the control group (M = 191.95, SD = 17.04) on fit factor scores t(8) = 6.2572, p =.00024. MASK MODEL GROUP EFFECTS There was a significant effect of treatment on mask fit factor at the p = .00042 level for the five conditions [F(4, 5) = 44.736, p = .000418]. The heat treatment passed fit testing through 5 treatment cycles, the UVGI treatment failed after one cycle. There was no significant effect between heat treatment for the two KN95 masks (M = 176.25, SD = 33.78) in comparison to the 2 untreated masks in the control group (M = 178.25, SD = 43.5) on fit factor scores t(2) = 0.078, p = .95. We did not observe a significant effect for heat treatment for the two 3M 8210 Plus masks (M = 200, SD = 0) compared to the 2 untreated masks in the control group (M = 200, SD = 0) on fit factor scores t(2) = 65535, p = N/A. The two KN95 masks that received UV treatment (M = 17.75, SD = 3.18) compared to the 2 untreated masks in the control group (M = 178.25, SD = 43.5) demonstrated significantly inferior fit factor scores t(2) = 7.3, p = .02. The fit of the UV treated masks compared to the two KN95 masks that received heat treatment (M = 176.25, SD = 33.78) also produced significantly inferior on fit factor scores t(2) = 11.4, p = .0076.
