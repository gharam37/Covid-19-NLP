India is also facing this very tough task for controlling the virus outbreak and has managed its growth rate through some strict measures. This study presents the current situation of coronavirus spread in India along with the impact of various measures taken for it. With the help of data sources (till 7 th -8 th April 2020) from various state units of India and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, this study presents various trends and patterns. This study answers six different research questions in a comprehensive manner. It has been reported that growth rate of infected cases has been controlled with the help of National Lockdown, however some uncontrolled mass level events had a negative impact on the infected cases. With the help of exponential and polynomial regression modelling, the predictions of up to 75000 cases have been done by the end of April 2020. It has also been seen that there are some prominent clusters and patient nodes in the network of patients which are the major influencers for COVID-19 spread. Also, death rate case predictions have been done through two-class classification models with an accuracy of 60%. At the end, strategies for continuation for lockdown has been discussed and presented. It appears that only essential services should be open for the citizens of India and the national lockdown should be carried on for next 2-4 weeks. This study will be useful for the Government of India and various states of India, Administrative Units of India, Frontline health workforce of India, researchers and scientists. This study will also be favorable for the administrative units of other countries to consider various aspects related to the control of COVID-19 outspread in their respective regions.",

The mortality rate is controlled at less than 3% right now, which is better than the ~5.5% mortality rate of world, but the model of spread is slowly moving towards an exponential trend which can lead to massive loss of lives and infrastructure (https://www.mygov.in/covid-19/).",

India accounts for almost one-fifth of the world's population and is second leading country in terms of population in the world. India contributes heavily to the world's GDP and is amongst the most prominent developing country in the world with fairly strong economic growth percentages [4] . India's good camaraderie with majority of the nations in the world and its helpful nature makes it a perfect ally for other countries. Therefore, the analysis of COVID-19 outbreak in Indian region is closely watched and monitored by the World and there is a need of comprehensive analytical studies based on different strategies taken by Indian administrators from time to time. India has been following a nationwide lockdown since 22-March-2020, which was a one-day lockdown, followed by a 21-day lockdown after two days. Every activity in India since then has been happening with the permission from various administration units and almost all the domestic and international travels have been either banned or monitored closely. India is yet to get into the third phase of COVID-19 outbreak i.e. the community outbreak as seen by various countries around the world, but the cases have been rising continuously. India's lockdown period has been impacted by two major events in the recent days which were related to the mass exodus of laborers and workers from one state to other states (especially from Delhi to neighboring states) and conduction of a religious event in Delhi which led to spike in the number of cases in various states of India. During this time, the Indian Prime Minister has been trying to connect with Indian citizens through innovative strategies and coming up with various engagement activities which are impacting the whole nation. With so much happening in India right now, it becomes imperative that we study the current situation and impact of various such events in India through data analysis methods and come up with different plans for future which can be helpful for the Indian administrators and medical professionals.",

The study also predicted the rise of infected cases in India with different lockdown periods. Similarly, a network structure approach was used by one of the study [8] to see whether any specific node clusters were getting formed. But only travel data nodes were considered by the authors to check which the prominent regions are affecting Indian travelers coming back to the India.

The patients were categorized as infected from the event as compared to other patients who were not related to the event. The trends and patterns were analyzed after conduction of this event i.e. in the first week of April 2020. The data was also confirmed from various news reports in India.",

The death rate has been keeping under 3% at all the stages of the COVID-19 spread. Looking at the graph in Figure 2 , it is clearly evident that a spike has been reported in India after 22 nd March 2020 i.e. the time when lockdown was announced. It clearly shows that Indian authorities were quick enough to sense the spread rate in Indian region and taking necessary steps of maintaining social distancing by announcing a rigid step of lockdown. .

Looking at the growth rate of infected cases on daily basis (blue line) and the trend line of expected growth (red line) in Figure 3 , it appears that in early days of infection the growth rate was quite high due to low number of cases. The growth rate has been calculated as the difference in number of cases between two consecutive days, divided by the count of infected cases on the previous day of the two days under consideration, multiplied by 100. Since, in the early days the count was in single digits, so the growth rate was pretty high. Hence ignoring that period, considering the second phase of time period from 5 th March to 22 nd March 2020 i.e. exactly before the lockdown, the growth rate has been hovering around 20% with trend line forecasting it to be maximum around 28%. However, for the time period after lockdown i.e. from 22 nd March 2020 onwards, the growth rate slightly increased, but it remained around a similar mark of 20%. And the trend line also predicted the growth rate on per day basis to be around maximum of 28%. Therefore, it can be said that the national lockdown has been able to contain the growth of the number of cases of COVID-19 patients. Without lockdown, the growth might not have been contained in India and may have gone into the exponential zone too quickly. This gives all the state level and national level administrators and health workers to get prepared for the rising number of cases.",

Thereafter, the prediction model of polynomial regression of degree 4 was built and used for the prediction values. For training set, data for 31 days was considered starting from 3-March-2020 to 3-April-2020. This was due to the fact that prior to 3 rd March, only 5 cases were reported in India within 40 days, which was impacting the prediction model. For evaluation, data from a short time period of 4-April-2020 to 7-April-2020 was used. Other combinations of training and test sets were also considered, but the predictions were similar.

The baseline value was considered as the median value for the corresponding day of the week. There were six different categories which were considered important for social distancing and there was a significant drop down seen in five of these categories. In Figure 5 , Graph shows a 77% decline as compared to the baseline in the visits at Retail and recreation places like restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, theme parks, movie theatres, etc.; 65% decline as compared to the baseline 11 in the visits to the Grocery & pharmacy places like markets, food shops, farmer places, drug stores, pharmacies, etc.; 57% decline as compared to the baseline in the visits to the Parks like public beaches, dog parks, marinas, national gardens, public gardens, etc.; 71% decline as compared to the baseline in the transit stations like bus stations, public transports, metro stations, train stations, etc.; and 47% decline as compared to the baseline at the Workplaces like private and government offices. It was seen that a 22% increase as compared to the baseline was observed at the residential places which implies that more Indians are now staying at their homes. All these numbers cannot be 100% as a lot of frontline health workers, administrators, pharmacists, grocery store owners and people involved in other essential services were on duty during the lockdown as well. However, the basic purpose of lockdown to maintain social distancing has been achieved to good potential. Citizens are spending more time at their homes as compared to crowded places. So it can be said that Indian citizens have been able to follow the lockdown effectively.",

Once the lockdown was announced, the fate of these 1.3 billion people was under scanner and that is why even the Government of India came up with a package of more than 22 billion USD to help these workers and laborers. All the respective state governments also came up with the different infrastructural setup for providing food and money to the needy citizens. Some agencies reported that in providing food security, India and the neighboring nations depending on India may fall short of food [25] while the others reported loss of millions of job [26] during the lockdown due to such mass exodus. However, the numbers of infected cases were not impacted much by this mass movement as majority of workers were not carrying any infection with them during their movements from their workplaces regions to their native place region.

Some of them who came from out of India to attend this event did not follow rules and advisories issued regarding COVID-19 protection. This resulted in a sharp spike in the number of infected cases after 31 st March 2020. As per the Figure 7 , at least 36% of the total infected cases reported on 6 th April 2020 were linked to the religious event in Delhi [28] . Out of over 4000 cases reported, a minimum of 1445 cases were suspected to be due to the religious event in Delhi. This event took the graph sky high in a week's time with growth slowly moving towards exponential path and India entering into the third phase of community transmission for COVID-19 virus. Many regions of India which were totally isolated with the infection of Corona Virus, also reported their first case in the first 3-4 days of the conduction of the event. Therefore, it can be said that religious event that happened in Delhi has really pushed the bars high for the number of infected cases from coronavirus in India. It has far more serious consequences than it seems right now and authorities needs to be really alert as people linked to this event have gone back to different parts of the nation.",

Other patterns were mined for the rules for COVID-19 patients; however rules were not significant enough for the positive cases as data for negative cases was not available in abundance. Based on the age group of COVID-19 infected patients, it was found that majority cases were in the age group of 31-40 years in India, as shown in Figure 8 . The deceased patients were majorly above 60 years of age group and majority people who are infected either travelled back from Italy or attended the religious event in Delhi. There was a classification model developed around patients who lost their lives after getting infected from the coronavirus. Decision Tree classification model [29] was used to classify that out of the given COVID-19 infected patients, whether a patient will be deceased or .

Out of 129, only 24 patients had complete demographic details available for the modelling, however for rest of the patients, relevant data imputation techniques [30] were used and missing values were filled up scientifically. Accuracy and Precision values were computed based on the confusion matrix generated from Decision Tree Classifier model. The model generated a 60% accuracy as the data points were too less for the model to be trained and tested. Moreover, the three-variable model was not sufficient enough to make any significant relevance out of the analysis. However, the deaths have found to be more prevalent in the age group of 60 or more years and Males were more prominent to getting deceased. Also, infants were least impacted by coronavirus in terms of life and death. The state of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh were found to be the significant regions for the dead cases. Not major inferences could be drawn from the classification model as numbers of cases were low, but as per the records of deceased patients, a hint can be taken by the medical and administrative authorities as in which type of patients (based on their demographical features) need extra critical care.",

Firstly, the growth rate of infected cases is continuously increasing. Secondly, the doubling time for number of infected cases in India is declining very fast making it a dynamic spread. Thirdly, majority of the Indians are cooperating and following the social distancing fairly well with mobility rates going down for public places in India. This is due to the combined efforts of the administrative authorities, engagement activities by the office of Prime Minister and citizen's will to stay away from social events. Fourthly, the sudden mass events are ruining the efforts of the Indian authorities to contain the spread of Coronavirus. And lastly, the penetration of the people infected from religious event has been really deep in India currently. There is a lot of tension created in India due to spread of infected people and the numbers are rising with each day. Thus, it is very difficult for India to completely ban the National Lockdown after 14 th April.",

It can be seen that majority of the states have witnessed more than 200% of growth rate in last one week, which is worrisome situation for all the state authorities. In fact, the national growth has also been towards 180% mark which is very high number in the last seven days. The administrators for the regions with less than 50 infected cases can consider the uplifting of ban on lockdown in their respective regions, however uplifting national lockdown looks difficult. The social distancing must be followed for next few weeks so that curve flattening process can continue for some more time.",

No inter-state domestic travel should be allowed for the time being as it may result in transferring the COVID-19 carriers from one region to another region. International travel flights must not be activated as the number of cases in majority of the regions of the world is very high. European and US regions are already facing most of the turmoil, while other parts of the world are seeing rapid rise in number of infected cases. Starting inbound international flights to India may disturb the COVID-19 action plan in India. Only essential services should be open for the citizens of India and lockdown should be carried on for next 2-4 weeks. Due to expected shortage of doctors, health workers and essential service providers, the Government of India should rope in the military, BSF, corporate, NGOs, students and volunteers. Provisions should be made in parallel to train them online and prepare them for the worst. Meanwhile, the Government of India should also plan to arrange Personal Protective Equipment & other resources for their optimal participation in the national mission. Lockdown with more stringent controls should be enforced for the next few weeks by identifying hotspots and isolating them. Due to the population density of the country, customized region wise solutions should be exercised with relaxation to practice livelihood in safer identified regions. For this, central level administrative unit, state level administrative unit and local level administrative units need to communicate with each other efficiently. The dis-ease can be better controlled in India due to massive stock of suitable medication available in the country, which is why India is also able to support other nations in terms of drug supply.",
