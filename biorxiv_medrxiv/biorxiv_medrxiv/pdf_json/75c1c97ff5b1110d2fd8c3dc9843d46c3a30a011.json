More studies are needed to further evaluate the risks and benefits that antiviral agents may bring. LPV/r is one of the first medications that were taken into clinical practice after the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, and it is recommended for treatment of COVID-19 patients in the latest version of China national practice guideline (released on March 4, 2020) without any reference. (9) Our rapid review however demonstrates that LPV/r is unlikely to be effective for COVID-19 in adults with numerous obvious adverse reactions, which was the same as recent studies. (62-63) Two rapid reviews conducted in 2020 (12-13) examined that early use of LPV/r can reduce the mortality and steroid dosing in patients with SARS and MERS, and suggested that it could be used as a component for an experimental regimen to treat COVID-19. But no quantitative analysis or evidence grading was performed, and therefore the reliability of the conclusions is questionable. Although LPV/r could reduce the mortality of adult SARS patients, the quality of evidence was low. Therefore, LPV/r should not be recommended in clinical practice guidelines.",
