Deep sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus, which was named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, then named COVID-19). Up to February 24, 2020, the total number of patients had risen sharply to 77,269 confirmed cases and 2,596 deaths cases (http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCoV/).

Previous studies have described the general epidemiological findings, clinical presentation, and clinical outcomes of patients of COVID-19 pneumonia [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Of note, latest data suggests that the kidney is the most vulnerable organ in COVID-19 patients besides the lungs, with evidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in up to 37.5% of fatal cases of COVID-19 [3] . However, there is currently no published information characterizing AKI risk factors and outcomes in patients with COVID-19. In this study, we investigated AKI in patients admitted to Hankou Hospital in Wuhan with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and determined the factors associated with AKI in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in order to identify factors that can be used for early identification of individuals who are at risk of developing AKI, so that they can be provided with intensive care treatment, thereby reducing the mortality and morbidity associated with AKI in patients with COVID-19.",

No negative control cases were examined, and no blinding occurred. The radiologists evaluated the initial CT scans and assigned quantitative scores for the characteristics using a recently published scoring system[9].

Although many patients had low pulse oxygen saturation when they were admitted to the hospital, the symptoms of dyspnea tended to be mild. The reason might be that the patient's condition gradually deteriorated and the body adapted and compensated to some degree. The very high CT score and the rapid deterioration of many patients after admission also provide evidence of the severity of the disease among the patients in this study. Second, the methods that we used to diagnose and stage AKI might have overestimated the incidence and severity. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the shortage of medical resources, many patients did not have a baseline serum creatinine test prior to admission, and had not had a creatinine test in the previous year. Therefore, we could only estimate the baseline serum creatinine of such patients according to the patient's sex, weight, medical history and other related parameters. The incidence of AKI was determined based on baseline values and serum creatinine values within 7 days of admission. In order to reduce the bias of our estimates of baseline values, the two methods, including average serum creatinine method [11] and eGFR 75 method [17], were used for comparison. The AKI incidence rate was 25.8% according to the average serum creatinine method and 19.2% according to the eGFR75 method (Supplemental Table 2 ). The calculated values of baseline serum creatinine estimated by the eGFR75 method were significantly different from those of some of the patients with baseline serum creatinine results available.",

Lymphopenia indicates that decreased immunity might occur in patients with COVID-19, and an increased level of PCT and CRP suggest that some patients may have had secondary bacterial infections which caused excessive inflammatory responses. Unfortunately, we did not conduct bacterial and fungal culture on the patients with respiratory coinfections detected on PCR because of the shortage of medical staff, and were unable to test patients' inflammatory factor profiles because the local hospital did not have inflammatory factor test kits. Previous studies [2] [3] [4] 7] have shown that patients with COVID-19 have significantly increased D-dimer levels, multiple organ damage, and electrolyte disturbances. Our study revealed that these abnormalities were more pronounced in patients with AKI. These results suggest that patients may experience severe hypoxia, resulting in aggravated multiple organs damage. It should not be overlooked that SARS-CoV-2 might also directly attack multiple organs, especially the kidneys. The occurrence and development of AKI often leads to the imbalance of blood volume and electrolytes, the accumulation of metabolites, the aggravation of multiple organ dysfunction, and creating a vicious cycle. While, the majority of patients with stage 1 AKI recovered and were discharged, those who progressed to stage 2/3 AKI, had an extremely high mortality rate. The underlying reason might be due to the limited treatment conditions in urgent breakout period of our country. The study results suggest that early intervention after the occurrence of AKI is very important, and that continuous renal replacement should be considered to help alleviate the progress of AKI.",

In fact, there are still a few suspected cases turned positive after with two negative RT-PCR results and discharged, which should be recognized as laboratory-confirmed cases.

These may interfere with the final prognosis judgment and lead to the failure to analyze the survival time.

Future studies of AKI in COVID-19 patients should obtain more accurate baseline creatinine values and use urine volume measurements as the basis for AKI determination. In addition, larger, multi-center studies are needed to gain a better understanding of AKI in individuals with COVID-19, and how to prevent and manage it.
