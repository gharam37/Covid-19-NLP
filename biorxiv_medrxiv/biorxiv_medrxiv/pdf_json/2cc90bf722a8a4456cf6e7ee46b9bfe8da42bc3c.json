We can learn from this case that convalescent plasma treatment can quickly turn the viral nucleic acid test negative and significantly reduced symptoms. The second case was a patient whose nucleic acid test was consistently positive with moderate symptoms, after treatment on 27 th day, the viral nucleic acid test turned negative four days later. Therefore, in order to save medical resources and reduce the transmission of infection, it is advisable to use convalescent plasma treatment on patients with long-term (more than 4 weeks) positive nucleic acid test of novel coronavirus.
