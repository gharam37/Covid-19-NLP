            "text": "cis-acting RNA motifs play a major role in regulating many aspects of RNA biology including posttranscriptional processing, nuclear export, RNA localization, translation and degradation. Here we analyzed the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other single-strand RNA (ssRNA) viruses for the presence of a unique cis RNA element called SECReTE. This motif consists of 10 or more consecutive triplet nucleotide repeats where a pyrimidine nucleotide (C or U) in present every third base, and which we identified in mRNAs encoding secreted proteins in bacteria, yeast, and humans. This motif facilitates mRNA localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), along with the enhanced translation and secretion of translated protein. We now examined for SECReTE presence in Group IV and V RNA viruses, the former including the Coronaviridae, like SARS-CoV-2 and other positive (+)ssRNA viruses, and the latter consisting of negative (-) ssRNA viruses. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains 40 SECReTE motifs at an abundance of ~1.3 SECReTEs/kilobase (kb). Moreover, all ssRNA viruses we examined contain multiple copies of this motif and appears in (+)ssRNA viruses as non-random in occurrence and independent of genome length. Importantly, (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Coronaviruses and Hepaciviruses), which utilize ER membranes to create double membrane vesicles to serve as viral replication centers (VRCs), contain more SECReTE motifs per kb as compared to (-)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Rabies, Mumps, and Influenza), that replicate in the nucleus or the cytoplasm, or other (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Enteroviruses and Flaviviruses) which employ different organellar membranes. As predicted by our earlier work, SECReTE sequences are mostly found in membranal or ER-associated/secreted proteins. Thus, we propose that SECReTE motifs could be important for the efficient translation and secretion of secreted viral proteins, as well as for VRC formation. Future studies of SECReTE function and identification of SECReTE-binding proteins could provide new drug targets to treat",

            "text": "Human infection with Coronaviridae (CoV) viruses can result in severe acute respiratory distress leading to lethality. The recent outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus emphasizes the potent ability of human coronaviruses (hCoVs) to infect and rapidly spread throughout the human population, given the absence of immune prophylaxis (e.g. vaccination) or curative treatment. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive (+) single-strand RNA [(+)ssRNA] virus comprising a genome of ~30kb encoding at least 29 viral proteins (VPs) involved in viral infection, replication, and release 1,2 . The genome is organized into a 5'untranslated region (UTR)-leader sequence, followed by a large open reading frame (ORF1ab) that encodes 16 non-structural VPs (nsp1-16), then by ORFs encoding the viral accessory proteins and structural proteins (e.g. spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N)), and terminating with a 3'UTR-polyA tail. The non-structural VPs are involved in the cleavage of polypeptide1ab (NSP5), suppression of host antiviral response (nsp1), creation of the viral replication center from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (nsp2, 3, 4, 6) , and viral RNA replication (nsp7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16) . As with other members of the hCoVs, infection of the lung epithelia with SARS-CoV-2 likely induces a reticulo-vesicular network of ER-derived double membrane vesicles (DMVs) that form a discrete viral replication organelle (or center; VRC) [3] [4] [5] . VPs are translated on the VRC surface, with many (i.e. soluble and membraneanchored proteins) translocated into the membrane of the newly forming structure. VRC formation, therefore, represents an essential step for both vRNA replication and virion assembly, and hence, progressive infection upon virion release. Yet, little is known of the organellar dynamics and interactions with either the viral RNA or VPs to create the replication membrane, although morphological alteration of the ER (and, perhaps, other secretory pathway organelles, e.g. lipid droplets, Golgi, endosomes) is consistent with the secretory nature of viral replication, which first involves nsp translation and translocation.",

Thus, vRNA interactions with ER-associated RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) likely constitute a critical rate-limiting step in VP production. In our work on RNA trafficking and association with intracellular organelles as a means to regulate protein translation and localization, we recently identified a cis RNA element present in nearly all secretome proteins from bacteria to humans 6 . This motif, entitled \"secretion-enhancing cis regulatory targeting element\" (SECReTE), is based upon extended (>10 consecutive) triplet nucleotide repeats whereby a pyrimidine nucleotide is present every third base, whether in coding regions (as NYN or NNY; where N is any nucleotide and Y = U or C) or in the UTR regions. Mutational analyses performed using several yeast genes encoding secreted proteins (e.g. SUC2, CCW12, HSP150) revealed that the addition or removal of SECReTE motifs in yeast mRNAs could enhance or inhibit mRNA stability and association with the ER, respectively, thereby .

Thus, SECReTE is important for mRNA-protein interactions at the level of the ER that facilitate protein production. We now identify numerous SECReTE motifs encoded in many of SARS-CoV-2 VPs, particularly in those encoding membrane-associated proteins. Viral SECReTE motifs (vSECReTEs) were found in the genes of all ssRNA viruses inspected and its abundance (i.e. SECReTE/kb) correlates overall with the percentage of C and T nucleotides (%CT) in the genomes (we use \"T\" instead of \"U\" henceforth for the convenience of sequence analysis). However, when looking at specific %CT levels we see a wide variability in SECReTE score between viral families/genera. Importantly, we found that (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Coronaviridae and Hepaciviruses) that utilize ER-derived DMVs for replication centers [3] [4] [5] 7 contain more SECReTE motifs per kb as compared to (-)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Rhabdoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, and Paramyxoviridae), which replicate in the nucleus or the cytoplasm [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , or other (+)ssRNA viruses which use different organellar membranes and do not form ER-derived DMVs (e.g. Enteroviruses, Nodavirridae, and Flaviviruses) 4, 5, 7, 14 . Interestingly, the position of some vSECReTE motifs along the length of the Spike gene of all seven human coronaviruses is quite similar. This co-occurrence may indicate the possibility of conservation/convergence of motif position. Thus, we predict that SECReTE motifs may be important for the association of viral RNA with the ER, as well as for the efficient translation of viral membrane proteins and creation of VRCs at ER membranes. Thus, continued studies of SECReTE function and the identification of SECReTEbinding proteins could provide new drug targets to treat COVID-19, and other (+)ssRNA related diseases.",

We first determined if SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (gRNA) contains SECReTE motifs using the same script we used to identify SECReTEs in yeast and human mRNAs 6 . We found that the ~30kb SARS-CoV-2 gRNA contains forty motifs ( Figure 1a ). All SECReTE elements are located in protein coding sequences (CDS) and 72.5% of the SECReTE elements are encoded in either membranal or secretion-associated proteins (e.g. nsp3, nsp4, nsp6, ORF7a, ORF7b, S, M, E and N proteins). Notably, all motifs, but one, are in NNY or NYN frames ( Figure 1A & Supplementary Table S1 ). This result is similar to our findings in yeast and humans, in which mRNAs encoding secretome proteins that contain either a signal peptide (SP) or TMD, as well as mRNAs encoding secreted proteins that lack these domains, contain SECReTE elements 6 .",

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are considered potentially pandemic coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, similar to SARS-CoV-2, but are less infectious and appear to result in a higher mortality rate than SARS-CoV-2 15 . The other four viruses are endemic to the human population and typically cause mild respiratory ailments with very low mortality rates 16 . Of note, hCoV-NL63 and hCoV-229E belong to the Alpha-CoV genus with a slightly shorter genome as compared to the other five CoVs, which belong to the Beta-CoV genus. All seven viruses contain SECReTE sequences in varying amounts (i.e. between 40-85 SECReTE motifs), the highest being hCoV-NL63 (Figures 1B-C and Supplementary Table S1 ). Based upon the limited data available regarding the infectivity and lethality of the different human CoVs, we did not observe an association between the number of SECReTE sequences and viral pathogenicity when comparing the three highly pathogenic (e.g. SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS) to the three least pathogenic (e.g. hCoV-229E, HKU1 and OC43), particularly if the moderately pathogenic 17 ",

The hemaglutinin esterase (HE) gene, which is present only in the hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-HKU1 genomes, also contains a large number (e.g. 7-8) of SECReTE elements. Only three of the hCoVs examined have SECReTE elements in their 5'UTRs and only one has a motif in the 3'UTR. Since the non-structural proteins are translated as two long polypeptides (pp1a and pp1ab), we scored the total number of SECReTE of pp1ab for each virus. As expected, pp1ab contains the largest number of SECReTEs, with a high variability between the different CoVs. The only exception is hCoV-HKU1, which contains more SECReTE sequences in S as compared to pp1ab.",

            "text": "Previously, we identified SECReTE as a pyrimidine-rich cis-acting RNA element prevalent in secretome-encoding genes from bacterial to human cells and demonstrated its role in facilitating protein secretion from yeast cells 6 . Here we demonstrate that SECReTE motifs are not exclusive to cells, but are also prevalent in viral genomes, including (+)ssRNA, (-)ssRNA, and ambisense RNA viruses (Supplementary Tables S1,4-6). Given the COVID-19 pandemic, we focused primarily on the (+)ssRNA viruses of the Coronaviridae, which includes SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 1A ) and other hCoVs. Interestingly, SECReTE motifs are more enriched in the (+)ssRNA viruses, as opposed to the (-)ssRNA and ambisense RNA viruses ( Figure 3A and B), and notably in the hCoVs ( Figures 1B   and C) . SECReTE motifs are found in hCoV genes encoding either structural or non-structural viral proteins ( Figure   1D ) and primarily, though not exclusively, in genes for membranal and secreted viral proteins (Figures 1E and F) . We also found that the level of SECReTE abundance per kb correlated well with the percentage of pyrimidines (%CT) present in the viral genomes within the (+)ssRNA and (-)ssRNA viruses in general ( Figure 3 ). However, there was variability in this correlation within the hCoVs (Figures 2A and B) and subsequent permutation analyses revealed that SECReTE occurrence in Coronaviridae and (+)ssRNA viruses is probably non-random (Table 2 ). In addition, SECReTE abundance did not correlate with viral genome length ( Figure S4 ).",

Overall, we could not form a definitive association between SECReTE score and hCoV pathogenicity. Interestingly, however, we could begin identify several potential phenomenon related to SECReTE presence in both viral and human genes. First, we observed that SECReTE positions within the hCoV Spike protein showed co-occurrence (Supplementary Figure S2 and Supplementary Table S1 ). This suggests that motif presence could be positionally conserved, although the mechanism by which this happens (i.e. conservation vs. drift vs. convergence) is not known. Nevertheless, it suggests a functional requirement for SECReTE in some aspect of either S gene RNA association with membranes or in Spike protein translation, or perhaps both. Further work is necessary to reveal the role (if any) of SECReTE motifs in hCoV RNA association with ER membranes or the translation of viral proteins, not only for the S gene, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.050088 doi: bioRxiv preprint but for all other structural and non-structural protein-encoding genes containing this motif. Since SECReTE presence or absence significantly affected the synthesis and secretion of three yeast proteins examined (Suc2, Hsp150, and Ccw12), as well as an exogenously expressed form of secretion-competent GFP in yeast 6 , we presume that the motif may fulfill a similar role in the production of viral proteins. Second, we determined that certain families of human proteins are enriched with SECReTE motifs more than random occurrence (Figure 4) .",

While entirely speculative, it would not be improbable to think that organization of the VRC on ER membranes and usurpation of host SECReTE-binding proteins could strongly influence the translation and translocation of secreted proteins, as well as tethering the viral genome to the ER membrane and the formation of DMVs. A negative impact upon the translation of proteins involved in innate immunity (e.g. defensins) and barriers to infection (e.g. mucins) alone might be expected to render cells more sensitive to infection 27 .

To test whether SECReTE sequences might be positionally conserved among the seven hCoVs, we aligned the S gene sequences and looked for co-occurrences of the SECReTE motifs. Strikingly, the SECReTE motif at the beginning of the gene (SECReTE27) is maintained in six out of seven hCoVs and SECReTE33, located in the single encoded TMD, is maintained in five out of seven hCoVs (Supplementary Figure S2A & B and Supplementary",

The data shows that (-)ssRNA viruses have a lower SECReTE score as compared to (+)ssRNA viruses. Note that in this plot we scored genomic segments separately (e.g. for segmented genome (-)ssRNA viruses, like influenza or ambisense RNA viruses). Thus, segments that lack SECReTEs have a SECReTE score of '0'. To gain further insight, we averaged the SECReTE score for each family or distinct genera and plotted them vs. %CT (Figures 3B and Supplementary Figure S3). We found a large variability in SECReTE content amongst (+)ssRNA viral families (e.g. ranging from ~0.3 to ~5 SECReTE/kb). However, all (-)ssRNA and ambisense viruses examined show, on average, 0.28-0.5 SECReTE/kb. The difference between (+)ssRNA and (-)ssRNA viruses was statistically significant (p<2.2 e-16;",

Detection of overlap between SECReTE sequences and TMD or within aligned S genes was done manually. For the permutation analysis, we shuffled (500 times) the coding sequences of selected viruses genes. The statistical significance of the SECReTE count per virus was calculated as (#successes +1) / (number of permutations + 1), where #successes is the number of permuted sequences with a SECReTE count higher than the native genome. Because genes in viruses tend to overlap, redundant SECReTE sequences were merged for calculation of the SECReTE count.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by a grant from the Jeanne and Joseph Nissim Center for Life Sciences Research, Weizmann Institute of Science and, in part, by a grant from the Israel Science Foundation (#578/18).
