The molecular basis for how some of these 158 mutations enhance RBD binding can be rationalized from the RBD-bound cryo-EM 159 structure (Fig. 4C ): hydrophobic substitutions of ACE2-T27 increase hydrophobic packing 160 with aromatic residues of S, ACE2-D30E extends an acidic side chain to reach S-K417, and 161 aromatic substitutions of ACE2-K31 contribute to an interfacial cluster of aromatics. 162",

The mature polypeptide (a.a. 19-805) of human ACE2 (GenBank NM_021804.1) 221 was cloned in to the NheI-XhoI sites of pCEP4 (Invitrogen) with a N-terminal HA leader 222 (MKTIIALSYIFCLVFA), myc-tag, and linker (GSPGGA). Soluble sACE2 fused to superfolder 223 GFP (34) was constructed by genetically joining the protease domain (a.a. 1-615) of ACE2 224 to sfGFP (GenBank ASL68970) via a gly/ser-rich linker (GSGGSGSGG), and pasting between 225 the NheI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). A synthetic human codon-optimized gene 226 fragment (Integrated DNA Technologies) for the RBD (a.a. 333-529) of SARS-CoV-2 S 227 (GenBank YP_009724390.1) was N-terminally fused to a HA leader and C-terminally fused 228 to superfolder GFP (34) and ligated in to the NheI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+). Human 229 codon-optimized full length S (a.a. 16-1273) was subcloned from pUC57-2019-nCoV-230 S(Human) (Molecular Cloud) with a N-terminal HA leader (MKTIIALSYIFCLVFA), myc-tag, 231 and linker (GSPGGA). 232 Tissue Culture.
