However, the social distancing practices from the COVID-19 pandemic is causing social disruption on a grand scale, potentially causing poor health outcomes. Through Google Trends analysis, we found a COVID-19-related surge in interest surrounding \"loneliness.\" We assessed if social isolation and loneliness increase the risk for all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality (ICD-10: I00-I99) and used the data to create a conceptual framework. Using the 10-year overall and cardiovascular mortality follow-up data (n = 12,019) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008), we conducted survival analyses and found that individuals who experience social isolation or loneliness have a significantly higher likelihood of overall and CVD mortality than those without support. These effects generally remained strong with further adjustment for NHANES-detected health and demographic differences showing the need to address COVID-19 related loneliness through increasing social nearing.",

Current proportions are historically unprecedented at 60% or more in some modern European and North American cities (Snell 2017) . Individuals who experience social isolation from social distancing risk experiencing loneliness. Social exclusion is particularly salient within older populations (Barbosa, Sanders, & Kokanovic 2019) that appear to be at the most risk for COVID-19 infection. Social pain is \"the experience of social loss, situations in which valued social relationships and intimacy are threatened, harmed, or lost\" (Baum, Lee, & Dougall 2011, p. 194) . Thus, it refers to the unpleasant experience felt by actual or perceived damage to one's sense of social connectedness or social value. Separation from loved ones, the loss of freedom, uncertainty over disease status, and boredom can be stressful resulting in harmful effects. Suicide and homicide have been reported, substantial anger generated, and lawsuits brought following the imposition of quarantine in previous outbreaks and the current pandemic (Sheperd 2020) . Some researchers have coined the term 'social recession' to reflect the long-term consequences and impact of isolation and loss of human interaction (Murthy & Chen 2020) .",

For instance, one study compared quarantined versus non-quarantined individuals during an equine influenza outbreak. Of 2,760 quarantined people, 34% reported high levels of psychological distress during the outbreak compared with 12% of non-quarantined individuals (Taylor et al. 2008) . Brooks, Webster, Smith, Woodland, Wessley, Greenberg, and Rubin (2020) , in a review of the literature reported frustration, boredom, post-traumatic stress, and anger, (p. 912) and acknowledged that some researchers postulated long-term harmful effects from quarantine. Social isolation has been found to be associated with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Further research suggests that physical and social pain might share biological substrates and extends this evidence base to the cardiovascular system (Inagaki et al. 2018 ). More specifically, increased blood pressure may serve as a regulatory function to modulate the effect of social pain, potentially affecting cardiovascular disease.

For instance, people who are socially marginalized and experience racism may have feelings of social mistrust and social rigidity. Many times, the elders or ethnic minorities feel socially withdrawn. These social distancing rules may result in certain individuals experiencing loneliness and social isolation. This may lead to an increase in overall and CVD mortality as is evidenced by our research. This may also lead to social strife due to a feeling of resentment. A maladaptive result may be bonding social capital which is exclusive bonding only within a social group. The person may look to blame minority groups for the spread of disease or feel isolated or stigmatized if they have the disease. This viewpoint would lead to further social withdrawal and the perpetuation of violence and strife. This leads to an iterative loop which can lead to social disintegration as has been evidenced by previous researchers (Gorman 2005) .",

Such mediating pathways are postulated to have long-term negative effects on health, causing increases in disease susceptibility and risk of mortality across many leading causes of death among elders. The role of social disconnectedness is particularly salient among populations with greater susceptibility to morbidity and mortality, such as older adults. The lack of social support for this population incurs real societal costs, such as longer hospital or nursing home stays when older persons lack caregivers who can help them recover at home (Taylor et al. 2008) .

The left part of the model is policies related to COVID-19, and the right is the long-term outcomes upon members of society. The top half of the model demonstrates that individuals who are flexible and are well adjusted can adapt to particular technologies to aid in social nearing. This ability to adapt has as much to do with adaptability as has to do with individuals who are not socially oppressed. For instance, ethnic minorities face more discrimination and stress than those individuals of the majority population (e.g, Williams 2018; Wong-Padoongpatt, Xane, Okazaki, & Saw 2020). As individuals feel supported due to the effective usage of video chatting technology, they can also feel a sense of social responsibility-moving along from left to right on the top segment of the model. By understanding the importance of social responsibility, this can lower mortality and create a sense of social cohesion. Also, this can leadto bridging social capital in that bonds can be created between ethnic groups and other social cleavages. This leads to the norm of reciprocity loop which is the expectation that people will respond favorably by returning benefit to benefit(Kj\u00f8rstad 2017). This loop allows for the building of social support and continuous positive outcomes for the individual and society.However, if the individual feels stigmatized and feels disempowered, the individual can then switch from the top half of the model to the bottom half.",
