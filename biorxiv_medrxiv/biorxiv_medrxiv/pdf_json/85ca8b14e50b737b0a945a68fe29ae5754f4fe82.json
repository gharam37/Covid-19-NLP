These actions were not coordinated at the national level, which raises the question of what might have happened if they were. It also creates an opportunity to use spatial and temporal variation to measure their effect with greater accuracy.",

This enables us to estimate the effect of stay-at-home orders while accounting for local variation in factors like health systems and demographics, and temporal variation in national mitigation actions, access to tests, or exposure to media reports that could influence the course of the disease.",

By day 27 the reduction (22.6 percentage points, 14.8 to 30.5) had surpassed the growth at the peak, indicating that growth had turned negative and the number of new daily infections was beginning to decline. A hypothetical national stay-at-home order issued on March 13, 2020 when a national emergency was declared might have reduced cumulative infections by 63.3%, and might have helped to reverse exponential growth in the disease by April 10.",

At that time, no mandatory actions were ordered at the national level other than international travel restrictions. 5 While the national government has the authority to act, the United States is a federal political system where public health is normally the purview of the fifty states. Furthermore, each state often delegates health authority to cities and/or counties, geographic political units nested within states. As a result, responses to COVID-19 varied across states and counties and led to spatial and temporal variation in implementation of mitigation procedures. This variation in policy responses has likely contributed to significant variation in the incidence and growth of infections across jurisdictions in the United States. 6 A variety of government policies have been proposed and used to mitigate the spread and consequence of pandemic diseases like COVID-19, ranging from investments in medical testing, contact tracing, and clinical management, to school closures, banning of mass gatherings, quarantines, and population stay-at-home orders. 7 China's extensive interventions appear to have been successful at limiting the outbreak. 8, 9 These include quarantines both for those diagnosed and those undiagnosed but who had been in Hubei province during the outbreak, 10 and restrictions on travel to and from affected areas. 11 In contrast, school closures across East Asia were estimated to be much less effective. 12 With estimates that nearly half of transmissions occur from pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, epidemiological simulations suggest that quarantines of symptomatic individuals alone will be insufficient to halt the pandemic. 13 This has led to widespread adoption of population-wide policies to dramatically reduce social contact.",

Stay-at-home orders require citizens to shelter in their residence with very few exceptions, and they have typically been implemented along with school closures, bans on mass gatherings, and closure of non-essential businesses. These policies are associated with a significant reduction in observed mobility, 14 and initial evidence from New York City suggests that they can be effective in reducing case growth in the United States. 15 Yet, because each locality in the U.S. has many factors that contribute to differential rates of transmission, statistical efforts to control for potential confounds and to identify the precise effects of stay-at-home orders are critical to understanding whether --and to what degree --such policies are working.",

We checked it once daily to update the data through April 17, 2020. In some cases a statewide order was reported with reference to earlier city-level or county-level orders in the state without specifying where they occurred. In those cases, we searched local news outlets to find references to official city and county orders in the state that preceded the statewide order. For each county in each state we recorded the earliest time and date that a city, county, or statewide order came into effect. Figure  1a shows the distribution of order dates. As of April 17, 2020, 18 states (1,451 counties) exhibited county-level variation in order dates, 27 states and the District of Columbia had statewide orders with no local variation (1,307 counties) and 5 states (386 counties) had no order in place.",

Growth rates begin to decline following the orders. However, a number of factors might confound this association in the raw data. For example, stay-at-home orders might closely follow earlier targeted mitigation measures at the national level (such as travel restrictions issued by the State Department or recommendations by the CDC on mass gatherings). There might also exist spurious correlation between local factors (such as susceptibility to the disease or the capacity of the health system) and the timing of stay-at-home orders. To control for these factors, we apply the fixed-effects model in equation (3) to the data. Table 1 shows four versions of the model. The main parameter that creates some uncertainty is d , the number of days an infected person remains contagious. Recent research suggests this period is about two weeks, so that is our assumption in Model 1. In Model 2 we show results if we set the value of d to 7 and in Model 3 we set d to 21. There is also some concern that measures of growth in cases of COVID-19 might be affected by the rate in growth in the availability of tests for the disease, so in Model 4 we include that variable as a control. Parameter estimates for all models are similar, so we will focus on Model 1 for the remainder of this analysis. All models include coefficients for days prior to the order that suggest differences in the case growth rate do not predict the timing of stay-in-place orders (Models 1-3 shown in Figure 3 ).",

Table 1 can be interpreted as percentage point changes in the rate of growth of COVID-19 infections associated with the number of days since a stay-at-home order has gone into effect. Negative numbers indicate a slowing of rate of growth though it is important to note that a smaller rate of growth still means an increasing number of total cases. For example, by Day 2, counties with stay-at-home orders achieve their first statistically meaningful reduction in the case growth rate (2.7 percentage points, 95% CI 0.2 to 5.2). After a week the reduction in the rate is 3.9 percentage points (1.0 to 6.9). At two weeks the reduction in the rate is 6.9 percentage points (2.4 to 11.5). And by Day 27, the expected reduction in the infection growth rate (22.6 percentage points, CI 14.8 to 30.5) has surpassed the average magnitude of growth rate at its peak (17.2%). When the growth rate turns negative, the number of new daily infections will start to decline and the epidemic will eventually come to a halt. Figure 3 shows these estimates along with the estimates for each day prior to the day a stay-at-home order goes into effect. Each panel of the figure displays the results given different assumptions about the number of days cases remain infectious. Unlike the raw data shown in Figure 2b , the estimates here are adjusted for unobserved factors that vary over time and between counties that can influence the course of the disease. Notice that the estimates in Figure 3 before the order goes into effect stay very close to zero. This suggests that differences in case growth are not influencing the timing of stay-at-home orders, helping to rule out the possibility that the later associations we see are driven by reverse-causality or differential trends.",

We account for this uncertainty by ensuring our results are robust to different assumed values, but it is still possible that the true value falls outside the range we show here. We also assume that the proportion of the population susceptible to the disease is constant, at 1, over space and time. If this assumption is strongly violated it might influence our estimates since they are linearly related to a parameter that is multiplied by that value.

Moreover, our analysis suggests these other local interventions might also have an effect on infection growth. On average, the peak of infections happens three days prior to the stay-at-home order. In addition, we see significant reductions in the growth rate of infections at just two days after the order. This is in spite of the fact that case identification during the early part of our observations was based on tests that often took a week to be resolved. 2 , 18 With our current empirical approach we cannot perfectly separate the effects of these other local interventions from that of stay-at-home orders. This means that our estimates should properly be interpreted as the effect of stay-at-home orders bundled with the effects of these other local interventions.

The uncoordinated nature of the response to the disease has created variation between localities and over time that we can exploit to more precisely estimate the effect these policies have on growth in infections. And we can use these estimates to quantify the effect that early coordinated action by the United States federal government might have had. The results show that the suite of physical distancing interventions that were implemented with stay-in-place orders probably greatly reduced the rate of growth in COVID-19 infections.",
