The scale of such lockdowns is unprecedented, and while some effects of lockdowns are readily apparent, it is less clear what effects they may have on outbreaks of serious communicable diseases. We examine the impact of these lockdowns on outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases. Using an agent-based model and simulations, we find that the risk and severity of such outbreaks is much greater under lockdown conditions, with the number of infected people doubling in some cases. This increase in number of cases varies by different mosquito-borne diseases, and is significantly higher for diseases spread by day-biting mosquitoes. We analysed various intervention strategies and found that during lockdowns, decentralised strategies such as insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying are more effective than centralised strategies.",

This increase in cases can be attributed to the increased mobility of infections over larger distances enabled by the few human agents still moving across the population in partial lockdowns, while also preserving the mosquitoes' advantage in being able to infect more humans. This result suggests that additional care must be taken to see that essential workers who continue to be mobile in lockdowns do not carry mosquito-borne diseases, and that others who may carry such infections are not allowed to move around. We further analyzed how the impact of lockdowns varies across three mosquito-borne diseases: chikungunya, dengue and malaria. We found that dengue outbreaks are more severe than chikungunya in any situation even though they share the same vector, Aedes Aegypti. This is because the dengue virus is transmissible from humans to mosquitoes even during late intrinsic incubation stage and early recovered stage. This in turn allows movement of infections by means of humans who are infectious but not showing symptoms (ironically in a manner similar to COVID-19). We also observed that the effects of lockdowns are less pronounced on malaria outbreaks, as they are spread by female Anopheles mosquitoes which are generally active during the night, a time where most humans are stationary with or without lockdowns.",

Last but not least, it seems fair to surmise that even when COVID-19 is finally overcome, humanity will not have seen the last of such epidemics and pandemics that may entail the use of lockdowns. Thus, the issue of how to deal with mosquito-borne diseases while enforcing lockdowns will continue to be pertinent.",

For modeling dengue and malaria epidemics, the parameters for infection and mosquito life-cycle, and infection transmission probabilities were adjusted accordingly. The altered parameters are summarized in Table 2 . It should be noted that the dengue virus can also be passed from human to mosquito in its late intrinsic incubation stage, plus early recovery stage [11] . The existing SEIR model was modified to support this possibility. As seen in Table 2 , the mosquito activity period also varies across diseases. This is because chikungunya and dengue share the same mosquito vector Aedes Aegypti, which usually operates during the day, in contrast to malaria, which is spread by night-biting Anopheles mosquitoes. We presume that 30% of the working human population works during the night instead of the day (as night-shift workers and the like).",
