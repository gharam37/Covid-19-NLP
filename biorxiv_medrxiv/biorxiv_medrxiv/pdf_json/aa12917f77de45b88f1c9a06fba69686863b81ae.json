However, the lack of biologically relevant pre-clinical experimental models of SARS-CoV-2 infection as a complement of classic cell lines represents a 35 major barrier for scientific and medical progress. Here, we advantageously used human reconstituted airway epithelial models of nasal or bronchial origin to characterize viral infection kinetics, tissue-level remodeling of the cellular ultrastructure and transcriptional immune signatures induced by SARS-CoV-2. Our results underline the relevance of this model for the preclinical evaluation of antiviral candidates. Foremost, we provide evidence on the antiviral 40 efficacy of remdesivir and the therapeutic potential of the remdesivir-diltiazem combination as a rapidly available option to respond to the current unmet medical need imposed by COVID-19. : bioRxiv preprint 65 reported the advantage of using more physiological models such as in-house or commercially available reconstituted human airway epithelia (HAE) to isolate, culture and study a wide range of respiratory viruses (8, 9) .

As of Mar 20, 2020, 9 days after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 a pandemic (2) , the new Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had caused approximately 8 800 deaths among more than 210 000 confirmed cases reported mainly in China but also spreading to at least 168 other countries or territories worldwide (3). Compared to the two other coronaviruses responsible for epidemic outbreaks in the past, 55 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the novel SARS-CoV-2 strain shares \u205379% and \u205350% genome sequence identity, respectively (4) .

In that regard, and considering that key features of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and its induced COVID-19 still require further characterization, the scarce readiness of biologically relevant pre-clinical experimental models of SARS-CoV-2 infection as a complement of the African green monkey VeroE6 cell line represents a major barrier for scientific and medical progress in this area. We and others have previously functional and innate immune features of the human respiratory epithelium that play a central role 70 in the early stages of infection and constitute robust surrogates to study airway disease mechanisms and for drug discovery (10).",

            "text": "In this study, we initially isolated and amplified in VeroE6 cells a SARS-CoV-2 virus directly form a nasal swab from one of the first hospitalized patients with confirmed in France (11) . The complete genome sequence of the isolated SARS-CoV-2 virus was deposited 75 in the GISAID EpiCoVTM database under the reference BetaCoV/France/IDF0571/2020 (accession ID EPI_ISL_411218). Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the isolated virus is representative of currently circulating strains (12) . We first characterized the replicative capacities of this viral strain in VeroE6 cells at different multiplicities of infection (MOIs) (Fig. 1A) , using both classic infectious titer determination in cell culture (TCID50) and molecular semi-quantitative 80 methods, the latter based on ORF1b-nsp14-specific primers and probes designed by the School of Public Health/University of Hong Kong (details in Supplementary Materials). This double approach was facilitated by the appearance of clearly observable characteristic cytopathic effect from 48 hpi (Fig. 1B) , and enabled the validation of a large interval (range 1-8 log10(TCID50)) with high correlation (R-squared 0.94) between molecular and infectious viral titers (Fig. 1C) . 85 In parallel, we successfully inoculated nasal MucilAir\u2122 HAE on the apical surface directly with nasal swab samples, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy observations (Fig.   S1 ). Characteristic features of coronavirus-induced cell ultrastructure remodeling were easily distinguishable in both the apical and basal sides of the HAE at 48 hpi, notably the high accumulation of progeny virions in mucus-producer goblet cells. Then, we advantageously 90 exploited the MucilAir\u2122 HAE model and in-house adapted protocols previously optimized for different respiratory viruses (13) to perform experimental infections with SARS-CoV-2.

Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), considered as a surrogate of epithelium integrity, was also measured during the time-course of infection (Fig. 1E) . In parallel, 95 comparative molecular viral genome quantification was performed at the three levels of the air/liquid HAE interphase: in apical washes (Fig. 1F, Apical) , total cellular RNA (Fig. 1G , Intracellular) and basal medium (Fig. 1H, Basal) . SARS-CoV-2 viral production at the epithelial apical surface increased sharply at 48 hpi, reaching 5.8 and 6.3 log10 TCID50/mL in nasal and bronchial HAE, respectively. The peak of viral replication was reached earlier in bronchial (48-72 100 hpi) than in nasal HAE, in which a progressive increase in infectious viral titers was observed until at least 96 hpi (Fig. 1D) . This replication kinetics was validated by molecular viral genome quantification at the apical pole ( Fig. 1F) . High viral replication correlated with a reduction in epithelium integrity at 48 hpi, reflected by more than 2.8-and 4-fold decreases in bronchial and nasal HAE TEER values, respectively, followed by a partial recovery in the case of bronchial HAE 105 (Fig. 1E) . Moreover, viral production at the apical pole was well correlated with intracellular viral genome detection during infection, except for the nasal HAE at 48 hpi, in which a strong relative increase of nsp14 RNA was observed (Fig. 1F) . Interestingly, viral genome was detected in the basal medium from 48 hpi, with the peak observed at 72 hpi ( Fig. 1H ) coinciding with the highest impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on epithelium integrity. 110 To further characterize the biology of the SARS-CoV-2, we inoculated both nasal ( Fig.   2A , B) and bronchial (Fig. 2C, D The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.017889 doi: bioRxiv preprint in Fig. 1 and with a recent study reporting high expression levels of the SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) in both ciliated and goblet respiratory cells (14) . As previously observed in structural studies of other coronaviruses, notably SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (15-18), we distinguished characteristic clusters in the perinuclear region of infected HAE cells. These clusters are mainly composed of numerous viral single-and double-membrane 120 vesicles (DMV) and mitochondria ( Fig. 2A, A1 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.017889 doi: bioRxiv preprint 48, 72 and 96 hpi (Fig. 3A) . This observation was substantiated by unsupervised analysis of the data using the full gene panel. Indeed, the first component of the principal component analysis 140 (PCA) that accounts for 63% of the variance is mainly driven by the time of infection, with a clear discrimination between 24 hpi and the other time-points (Fig. 3B , red triangles/dots). Interestingly, the immune transcriptomic signatures seem at least partially driven by the nature of the HAE beyond 24 hpi (Fig. 3A) . This is in agreement with the second component analysis, gathering 12.6% of total variance, which allowed a clear differentiation between the nasal and bronchial 145 compartments (Fig. 3B , green/purple triangles versus dots). In the nasal HAE, the response after 24 hpi (peak at 72-96 hpi) is driven by a strong upregulation of type I and type III IFNs (IFNB1, IFNL1, IFNL2-3-4) as well as other immunity-related genes. Whereas only a subset of these genes (CXCL10/IP10, CXCL2/MIP2A, IL1A, IL1B, Mx1 and ZBP1) follow the same pattern in the bronchial HAE, though at overall lower expression levels, the initial modulation of IFNB1, IFNL1, 150 CCL2/MCP1 and IL6 in this tissue seems to fade at 96 hpi. Moreover, the relative expression of a subset of genes associated with the NF-kB and TNF\u03b1 pathways (e.g. IL18, IL18R1, NFKB2, NFKBIA, TNFA, and TNFAIP3) is mostly unchanged all throughout the infection in bronchial HAE but it is highly upregulated in nasal HAE at 48 hpi and onwards ( Fig. 3C and Data S1).",

These results are in accordance with the first clinical reports describing in some patients a rapid worsening of the respiratory condition and overall clinical state by day 7-10 after symptom onset (21) , most probably related to a cytokine storm syndrome (22). We therefore evaluated in both VeroE6 and HAE model the antiviral potential against SARS-CoV-2 of remdesivir monotherapy but also in combination with diltiazem. Diltiazem is a voltage gated 170 Ca2+ channel antagonist currently used as anti-hypertensive for the control of angina pectoris and cardiac arrhythmia (26) , which we have recently repurposed as an effective host-directed influenza inhibitor due to its so far undescribed capacity of inducing the interferon (IFN) antiviral response, particularly type III IFNs (Fig. S2) (8) . Additionally, the rationale of testing such virus-directed plus host-directed drug combination is consistent with a novel study describing hypertension as a 175 potential risk factor observed among a cohort of inpatients with COVID-19 (19), and two reports not anticipating potential adverse effects of diltiazem (27) or negative pharmacological interactions of between remdesivir and diltiazem for the treatment of COVID-19 (28) .

Nonetheless, addition of 11.5 \u00b5M diltiazem significantly potentiated the antiviral effect of remdesivir ( Fig. 4A-C) , inducing 68% and 50% 185 reductions in remdesivir IC50 values at 48 and 72 hpi, respectively. Comparably, daily treatment with 20 \u00b5M remdesivir resulted in 7.3 log10 and 7.9 log10 reductions of intracellular SARS-CoV-2 viral titers at 48 hpi in nasal and bronchial HAE, respectively (Fig. 4D, upper panel) . Not surprisingly for a model with a completely functional IFN response, daily treatment with 90 \u00b5M diltiazem resulted in moderate yet substantial (0.4 log10 and 0.8 log10, respectively) reductions of 190 intracellular viral titers in nasal and bronchial HAE at the same time-point (Fig. 4D, upper panel) .",

Importantly, remdesivir also showed a strong antiviral effect at 72 hpi (Fig. 4E, upper panel) .

Large electron-dense structures corresponding to the accumulation of viral material in active virus replication zones as well as typical double-membrane spherules containing pieces of membranes interspaced among virions being formed were also observed at 48 hpi (Fig. 2B, D). Moreover, double-membraned spherules containing numerous virions are noticeable near the plasmatic membranes (Fig. 2B1, D2). These 125 spherules as well as several clusters of virions were observed mostly at the surface of ciliated cells (Fig. 2A2). These features are characteristic of the late stages of the viral cycle, hence confirming the capacity of the HAE to reproduce the asynchronous nature of infection. Recent reports associate COVID-19 with high plasma levels of certain immunostimulant and proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL6), notably in patients with severe disease (6), suggesting 130 a potential link with a poor prognosis (19). However, such inflammatory state has been much less characterized in the respiratory microenvironment thus far. To investigate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on gene expression, we used Nanostring hybridization-based technology (Seattle, USA) on both nasal and bronchial HAE for multiplex mRNA detection and relative quantification of two complementary panels of genes (20) involved in the immune response (Data S1). Heatmap 135 and hierarchical analyses identified two distinct levels of clustering. First, regardless of the nasal or bronchial nature of the HAE model, the gene expression profile at 24 hpi highlights a marked upregulation of a subset of \u205314% of the studied genes, which are subsequently downregulated at",

In that regard, although further studies in terms of dose optimization would be desired, we provide evidence in both classic and complex in vitro experimental models on the potential of the remdesivir-diltiazem combination as an option worthy of consideration to respond to the current medical unmet need imposed by COVID-19. The combination of a virus-directed plus a host-directed drug could result in enhanced antiviral and/or 220 immunomodulatory effects, including during the immunopathologic phase frequently observed the second week of infection. This association could also reduce the therapeutic doses of chemotherapeutic agents targeting nucleic acid synthesis and therefore minimize putative adverse side effects. Indeed, such two-pronged approach would be of special interest for the treatment of at-risk patients within the first 10 days from symptom onset, when effective clearance of viral load 225 still plays a major role in the clinical outcome.",
