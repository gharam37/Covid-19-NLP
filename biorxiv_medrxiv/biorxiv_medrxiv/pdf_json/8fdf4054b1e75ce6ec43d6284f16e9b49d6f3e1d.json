The implications of misunderstanding the real dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic are extremely dangerous. Ethnic or social discrimination resulting from unsupported assumptions on viral contagion -often amplified by irresponsible, uncontrollable communications -can be highly damaging for people and countries. In particular, the US-based NextStrain (4) team has been posting real-time updates on the epidemic tracing by molecular analyses. Despite (social) media are often vehicle for fake news and boast news hype, it is also worth noting the tremendous effort of the scientific community to provide free, up-to-date information on ongoing studies, as well as critical evaluations. Several discussions and evidence-based debates on controversial hypotheses on the epidemic have ensued -such as the number of untraced infections in the US, the putative virus introduction in Italy through Germany, and the alleged lineage diversification in China (5) later criticized (6) . Recently, an editorial published on Science (7) has also highlighted how unsupported or misleading claims circulating in forums, social media, and even peer-reviewed articles, have been led by a substantial over interpretation of the available data. Hence, the urgency to reframe the current debate in more rigorous scientific terms, and quantitatively evaluate whether sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies currently exists, or which gaps need to be addressed. We explored the characteristics of few datasets through time and assess phylogenetic signal to understand whether we this data is useful of not.",

SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequences were obatained from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) (9) at different timepoints. As of March 30 th , we compared the number of full genomes sampled per country with the number of confirmed cases at the time of sampling, as well as the country's total population (Figure 1 ). We obtained 2608 full genomes from 55 countries ( Figure 1 ). During the past month, the number of genomes has correlation between confirmed cases and genomes per country to be 0.49 on March 30 th , and we considered it as a proxy for sampling homogeneity. However, correlation could only be investigated with confirmed cases (again as proxy), since not all affected countries have made publicly available the total number of coronavirus testing performed. Moreover, even within the same country, sequenced genomes were usually sampled from few hotspots, not necessarily representative of the whole epidemic in that country. It is worrisome that, as of March 30 th 2020, the two top countries in terms of confirmed cases do not show sufficiently large and representative sampling. SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequences available from patients in the US, the country with the highest number of confirmed cases, have mainly been sampled in Washington state (66%) during the early epidemic, while less than one third (32%) are available from the epicenter of the US epidemic, the state of New York. Italy, the second country per confirmed cases, uploaded 26 genomes, of which one from the Marche region, four from Friuli Venezia Giulia, seven from Abruzzo, nine from Lazio, and only five from Lombardy, which is epicenter of the Italian epidemic (Table S1) ",

Assessment of phylogenetic signal in the dataset was carried out using likelihood mapping analysis (11) , which estimates the likelihood of each of possible tree topology for any group of four sequences (quartet), randomly chosen from an alignment, and reports them inside an equilateral triangle (the likelihood map) where the corners represent distinct tree topologies and the center star-like trees.",

Extensive simulation studies have shown that, for sequences to be considered robust in terms of phylogenetic signal, side/center areas of the likelihood mapping must include <40% of the unresolved quartets (12) . Overall, phylogenetic signal in the present data has been increasing with number of genomes been released. Percentage of unresolved quartets detected in the SARS-CoV-2 full genomes alignment on March 3 rd and 10 th was still too high to allow reliable inferences ( Figure S1 ).

SARS-CoV-2 full genome dataset is now showing less than 40% of unresolved quartets in the center: 38.6% unresolved quartets on March 18 th (794 genome sequences) ( Figure S1c ) and 32.3% on March 25 th (1,660 genome sequences) ( Figure S1d ). This indicates that the amount of phylogenetic information is now potentially usable to define phylogenetic relationships among strains. Plotting mean genetic distance of each sequence from the root of a phylogeny versus the sequence sampling time allows to testing for significant linear correlation, which is necessary for the calibration of a reliable molecular clock (13) ( Figure S3 ). As expected in genomes obtained over a very short period of time (~ three months) since the beginning of the outbreak, correlation in the current data is fairly week (Table   S3 ). However, Bayesian analysis (14) , which infers phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns from a posterior distribution of trees, might facilitate comparisons about different evolutionary scenarios, help in retrieving the correct topology, and estimate an accurate evolutionary rate using relaxed clock methods (15) . Reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships of the same European Subclade A discussed above with sequence available on March 18 th 2020 showed a much more complex snapshot of SARS-CoV-2 spreading ( Figure S4 ). Taking a closer look at the Sublade A reveals that even with more genomes available, inference is bias by over-sampling of some countries and under-sampling of others ( Figure S4 ).

Recently, methods were developed to estimate, for each pair of viral sequences from two infected individuals, how many intermediates there are in the putative transmission chain connecting them, using a transmission matrix (16) . The analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows that numerous links among samples are still missing ( Figure S5 ). In such a scenario, it is not advisable to extrapolate conclusions on the origin and dissemination of strains.",

As long new data do not increase phylogenetic and temporal signal, results will remain highly questionable. Characterization of transmission events is fundamental to understand the dynamics of any infectious disease. From a public health standpoint, being able to trace transmission at the local level is crucial. Within country identification of active transmission clusters would open the way to more effective public health measures. The most optimal inference of transmission events would have a combination of genetic and epidemiological data for a joint analysis. However, it is not possible, at the moment, to identify transmission clusters within regions, counties, or cities, solely on genetic data, since micro-scale genetic data is not yet available. Indeed, transmission investigations that have been performed so far have been based on contact-tracing, epidemiological and clinical data (17, 18) .",

ML tree reconstruction was performed in IQ-TREE based on the best-fit model chosen according to Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) (20, 21) . Exploration of temporal structure, i.e. presence of molecular clock in the data, was assessed by regression of divergence -root-to-tip genetic distance-against sampling time using TempEst (13) . In this case, absence of a linear trend indicates that the data does not contain temporal signal and that the data is not appropriate for phylogenetic inference using molecular clock models.

The top 5 contributing states in US are Washington (405, 66%), California (45, 7%), Minnesota (33, 5%), Wisconsin (29, 5%), and Utah (22, 4%); 42 genomes are not labeled with a state or city.

On the contrary, and unexpectedly, countries with low number of genome sequences did show presence of phylogenetic signal: Germany, Spain and France (Figure S6).Despite the presence of phylogenetic signal in these countries, only genomes form France also show temporal signal that would allow for calibration of a molecular clock and re-framing phylogenetic and phylogeography inferences in spatiotemporal dimension. On the other hand, the transmission matrix for France indicates that considerable links are still missing due to unsampled infected individuals, limiting the reliability of transmission cluster studies based on sequence data (Figure S8).",
