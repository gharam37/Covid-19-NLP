Closely resembling with SARS CoV, the present strain has manifested exceptionally higher degree of spreadability, virulence and stability possibly due to some unidentified mutations. The viral spike glycoprotein is very likely to interact with host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmits its genetic materials and hijacks host machinery with extreme fidelity for self propagation. Few attempts have been made to develop a suitable vaccine or ACE2 blocker or virus-receptor inhibitor within this short period of time.",

We screened here few pairs of spike protein epitopic regions and selected their energetic, IC50, MHC II reactivity and found some of those to be very good target for vaccination. A possible role of glycosylation on epitopic region showed profound effects on epitopic recognition. The present work might be helpful for the urgent development of a suitable vaccination regimen against SARS CoV-2.",

Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine are now being prescribed somewhere to fight COVID-19 for the time being [10, 11] . Human coronaviruses and other influenza viruses resulted in epidemic in last 2 decade in different parts of the world. The anomalies between severity and spreading between the origin site, China and the other parts of the World (European and North America countries) might have some indication. Common human CoVs may have annual peaks of circulation in winter months in the US, and individual human CoVs may show variable circulation from year to year. [12] Colder climate and prior exposure to other human coronaviruses, or influenza or flu viruses or possible vaccination against those might develop antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of immunological responses during recent SARS CoV-2 exposure. ADE might have modulated immune response and could elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm [13, 14] . Possibly, that could be one of the reasons (more history of exposure with CoVs beside weaker immune system) for older people being more affected by the present SARS CoV-2. Moreover, both helper T cells and suppressor T cells in patients with COVID-19 were below normal levels. The novel coronavirus might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T .

Strong inflammatory events could be the initiator of the collapsing environment during COVID-19 infection. In most of the death cases in COVID-19 infections, acute respiratory failure is followed by other organs like kidney anomalies. In these cases inflammatory outburst might have worsened the infection and post viral-incubation situations [16, 17] . Recent studies in experimentally infected animal strongly suggest a crucial role for virus-induced immunopathological events in causing fatal pneumonia after human CoV infections [18] . So, combined anti-viral and anti-inflammatory treatment might be beneficial in these cases [19] . SARS-based available immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy to neutralize and protect from infection by targeting the novel spike protein. [20] .",

Whereas, docking score of posture 5 (with NAG) -3085.38, showed binding free energy of complex, -30.06. That indicated the rigid binding of 10B epitope when it lacks the NAG molecule. The interactive analysis also revealed that without NAG, 10B binds with more amino acids of MHC class II HLA-DRA, DRB (Figure 6c) where structural stabilization by hydrogen bond networking was noticed. But, the bindings were less when NAG residue was attached(Figure 6f).
