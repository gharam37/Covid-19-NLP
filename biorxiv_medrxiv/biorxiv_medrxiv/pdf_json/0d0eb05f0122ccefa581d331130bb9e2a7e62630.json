The COVID-19 is the etiologic agent of a recently arose disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Presently, there is no vaccine available against this emerged viral disease. Therefore, it is indeed a need of the hour to develop an effectual and safe vaccine against this decidedly pandemic disease. In the current study, we collected SARS-CoV-2 genome from Indian geographical origin against human host, further more using reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics tools here we claim effective vaccine candidates that can be mile stone in battle against COVID19. This novel study divulged two promising antigenic peptide GVYFASTEK and NFRVQPTESIV from surface glycoproteins (protein accession no. -QIA98583.1 and QHS34546.1) of SARS-CoV-2, which were predicated to be interacted with class I and class II MHC alleles and showed up to 90% conservancy and high value of antigenicity. Subsequently, the molecular docking studies were verified molecular interaction of these prime antigenic peptides with the residues of HLA-A*11-01 allele for MHC Class I and HLA DRB1*04-01 allele for MHC class II. After vigorous analysis, these peptides were predicted to be suitable epitopes which are capable to elicit the strong cell-mediated immune response against the SARS-CoV-2. Consequences from the present study could facilitate selecting SARS-CoV-2 epitopes for vaccine production pipelines in the immediate future. This novel research will certainly pave the way for a fast, reliable and virtuous platform to provide timely countermeasure of this dangerous pandemic disease, COVID-19. : bioRxiv preprint new vaccine candidates and their consequent precise application. This study will lead the research in a new and effectual direction and the outcome of our study will provide a fast, reliable and significant platform in search of effective and timely cure of this dangerous pandemic disease, COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV2.

It gained rapid foothold across the world resulting in WHO declared it as a pandemic [2] . As on April 5 th , worldwide total 1,205,825 cases and 64,978 deaths were reported by WHO [3] . In this period of time when the continuous transmission of the virus across borders and health burden on the global scale is rapidly increasing, more urgent studies are required and in the absence of effective cures majorly drugs, vaccination or immunization therapy is imperative in order to target whole population. Likewise to move forward vaccine development pipeline, immunoinfomatics tools have been proved crucial [4] . Since the Covid19 has affected almost all of the world's population, promiscuous epitopes binding to a variety of HLA alleles for larger dissemination is vital. For that, in silico approaches will be remarkably useful in helping develop a cure in as fast manner as possible [5] . The antibody generation by activation of B-cell as well as acute viral clearance by T-cells along with virus-specific memory generation by CD8+ T-cells are analogously important to develop immunity against the virus [6] . The S protein is considered highly antigenic and thereby can evoke strong immune responses and generate neutralizing antibodies that can block the attachment of virus to the host cells [7] .",

Since, the helper T cell contains CD4+ molecule on its surface, it is also called as CD4+ T cell. After activated by APC, the T-helper cell then activates the B cell and causes the production of antibody producing plasma B cell along with memory B cell. The plasma B cell produces a large number of antibodies and the memory B cell functions as the immunological, long term memory.

The IEDB server generates and ranks the epitopes on the basis of their antigenicity scores (AS) and percentile scores. The top ten MHC class-I and MHC class-II epitopes were taken for analysis. The topology of the selected epitopes was determined by TMHMM v2.0 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). In the antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity and conservancy analysis, the T-cell epitopes that were found to be highly antigenic as well as non-allergenic, non-toxic, and had conservancy of over 90% . Among the ten selected MHC class-I epitopes and ten selected MHC class-II epitopes of both proteins, total four epitopes were selected based on the mentioned criteria: GVYFASTEK, TLADAGFIK, NFRVQPTESI and LLIVNNATNVV as well as antigenic and non-allergenic B-cell epitopes were selected for further vaccine candidate .

The cluster analysis of the possible MHC class-I and MHC class-II alleles that may interact with the predicted epitopes were performed by online tool MHC cluster 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MHCcluster/).

The allergenicity is defined as the ability of that substance to act as allergen and induce potential allergic reactions within the host body [32] .",
