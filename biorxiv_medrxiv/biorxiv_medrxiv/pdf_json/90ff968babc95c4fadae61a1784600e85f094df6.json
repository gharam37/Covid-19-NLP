Since CPET is not 5 feasible in population-based settings, our aims included evaluation of a triage/screening tool for 6 cardiorespiratory risk. 7 METHODS: CPET-derived anaerobic thresholds were evaluated retrospectively in 26 patients with 8 pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who represent a challenging group to risk-categorise.",

Such decisions are based on factors such as age 34 and pre-existing medical conditions, in addition to acute observations and measurements. With the 35 exception of certain common disease states, there is little evidence regarding associations with specific 36 infections or complication risks. Diagnostic labels are generally linked under a single, negative 37 umbrella of \"pre-existing medical conditions\". There is particular concern that as for health insurance, 38 lack of familiarity with rare diseases may lead to an inappropriately negative weighting, with no time 39 to redress in an acute triage setting.",

This is a simple 13-point scale of activities of increasing difficulty whereby the user 53 indicates which activity normally causes them to stop when performed for a period of time.[5] The 54 activities correspond to metabolic equivalents (METs), and numerous studies show a good correlation 55 with AT derived from cardiopulmonary exercise testing [6-8], mortality [9] and postoperative 56 complications [10].",
