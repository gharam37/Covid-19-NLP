            "text": "Epidemiologists use mathematical models to predict epidemic trends, and these results are inherently uncertain when parameters are unknown or changing. In other contexts, such as climate, modellers use multi-model ensembles to inform their decision-making: when forecasts align, modellers can be more certain. This paper looks at a sub-set of alternative epidemiological models that focus on the growth rate, and it cautions against relying on the method proposed in (Pike & Saini, 2020): relying on the data for China to calculate future trajectories is likely to be subject to overfitting, a common problem in financial and economic modelling. This paper finds, surprisingly, that the data for China are double-exponential, not exponential; and that different countries are showing a range of different trajectories. The paper proposes using non-parametric and local regression methods to support epidemiologists and policymakers in assessing the relative effectiveness of social distancing policies.

The inherent uncertainty in these models, and in the early stages of an epidemic, is evident from the calls from epidemiologists at Oxford, UK, for 'large scale serological surveys ' (Louren\u00e7o et al., 2020) to improve the accuracy of parameters such as susceptibility; and in the range of scenarios presented by epidemiologists at Imperial, UK (Ferguson et al., 2020) . This difficult in choosing and parameterising the most effective prediction model is not unique to epidemiology. To resolve this, climate modellers use multi-model ensembles in their decision-making processes, acknowledging that 'even if the perfect climate model did exist, any projection is always conditional on the scenario considered' (Tebaldi & Knutti, 2007) . Similarly, after the 2008 global financial crisis, over-reliance on equilibrium models by policymakers was recognised as both 'ubiquitous' (Bezemer, 2010) and 'flawed' (Bieta et al., 2012) ; leading to widespread calls for alternative approaches.",

This paper is motivated by a plethora of articles that focus on the 'doubling rate', which is the time taken for the total number of people infected to double. The 'doubling rate' is related to the growth rate (see Table 2 ) and successful reduction in the growth rate, by both individual and public health measures, is the goal of social distancing and other interventions. The aim is to flatten the curve and avoid a huge peak that would overwhelm health services (Wighton, 2020) . The recent spate of articles includes contributions from nonepidemiologists and the media (Cuffe & Jeavans, 2020; Financial Times, 2020; Pike & Saini, 2020) . The author is not arguing for alternative approaches to be given equal weight in the decision-making process, but to inform the debate by helping explain differences in outcomes between countries. In addition, this research is motivated by a desire to test the validity of assumptions made by Pike and Saini (2020), who used data from China to predict out of sample death rates in other countries after the implementation of social distancing.",

For that reason alone, the author would caution against relying too heavily on the data from China. Following a well-established precautionary principle that, in medical research, 'one should take reasonable measures to avoid threats that are serious and plausible' (Resnik, 2004) , the author has refrained from using recent data on death statistics published by individual countries, and has instead focused on infection statistics (CSSE, 2020; UK-Government, 2020) . Forecasting health care needs is known to be uncertain (Grenfell et al., 1994; Rein et al., 2011) but infection rates have the advantage that they are a leading indicator for pressure on intensive care beds. The author is required to get approval from his University ethics committee for research that 'would induce psychological stress, anxiety or humiliation' (DMU, 2020) and, given the author is not an epidemiologist, full approval and peer review were sought before pre-publication. Underestimates of intensive care beds could lead to a reduction in compliance with social distancing which, in turn, could lead increased harm to those most at risk of infection. Conversely, overestimates of intensive care beds could lead to unnecessary public health measures which, in turn, could lead to additional financial and economic harm.",

For exponential-type growth, there are three choice of mathematical models: exponential-unrestrained; log-log (as per exponential, but with a longer period of decline); and logistic (approximately exponential at first, but with a reduced rate as an upper limit is approached). A logistic model fails the precautionary principle in that the carrying capacity, or c, can only be estimated ex-post. Hence, a logistic model is discarded.",

There is some evidence, from the data shown in Whilst there are lower initial growth rates in several countries, such as Bahrain, Iran, Kuwait, Qatar and Singapore -the evidence presented thus far supports the null hypothesis that social distancing in different contexts is likely to lead to different outcomes. To the author's knowledge, there is no theoretical basis for assuming that other countries will follow China's trajectory. Rather, the evidence, from the results presented, is that a range of different outcomes are likely. Policymakers will need to take account of differences in social, cultural, political, and economic factors; to take account of different data collection, quality, and consistency issues across different settings; and should take account of the lag, of around 10 days, between the start of social distancing and any significant impact on the number of cases.
