Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA viruses that infect humans and many animals. 1 2019-nCoV affects different people in different ways. The common symptoms of the disease are fever, fatigue and dry cough. Coronaviruses have caused two major pandemics, such as SARS and MERS over the past two decades. 2, 3 Since the SARS outbreak 18 years ago, a large number of SARS-related Coronaviruses (SARSr CoV) have been discovered in bats. Zhou et al. (2020) reported that 2019-nCoV was identified in China (Wuhan) that caused an acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in humans. 4 The outbreak that started on 12 December 2019 continues to spread worldwide and results in fatality. Since there is no approved treatment for COVID-19 currently prevention and preparation in healthcare services are crucial. This study include Italy and Spain that have high number of case and death from Europe also Turkey in which number of the case and death start to increase. From February 2, 2020 to March 27, 2020; means of the fatality rates of Italy, Spain and Turkey are calculated as %10, %7 and %2, respectively. Modeling and future forecast of daily number of confirmed cases and deaths can help the treatment system. 5 Aim of present study, the statistical prediction models could be meaningfull in forecasting and controlling this global pandemic threat. For this purpose, Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was used to predict the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19.",
