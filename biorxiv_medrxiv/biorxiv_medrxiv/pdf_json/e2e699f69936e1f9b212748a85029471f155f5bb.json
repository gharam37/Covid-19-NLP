Due to the overwhelming use of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests worldwide, availability of test kits has become a major bottleneck. Here we demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of two simple pooling strategies that can increase testing capacity about 5-fold to 7.5-fold, in populations with a low infection rate. We have implemented the method in a routine clinical diagnosis setting, and already tested 2,168 individuals for SARS-CoV-2 using 311 RNA extraction and RT-PCR kits.",

Among the foremost priorities to facilitate efficient public health interventions is a reliable and accessible diagnosis of an active SARS-CoV-2 infection. The standard laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 involves three main steps, namely, viral inactivation and lysis of the nasopharyngeal swab sample, extraction (or purification) of viral RNA, and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Due to the rapid spread of the virus and the increasing demand for tests, the limited availability of test reagents, mainly RNA extraction kits, has become (and is likely to continue to be) a major bottleneck as the pandemic expands.",

A group testing algorithm is a testing scheme which is directed towards minimizing the number of tests conducted on a set of samples by using the ability to test pooled subsets of samples. If a pool of n samples tests negative, all samples must be negative, and therefore their status has been determined in only one test instead of n individual tests. Various group testing algorithms exist, with different assumptions and constraints (see [14, 15] ). While many such algorithms, most notably binary splitting, may be very efficient in theory, they might be unsuitable because of practical limitations. Three such limitations might be: (1) a limit on the number of stages due to the importance of delivering a test result quickly, exemplified by the urgent clinical context of COVID-19 diagnosis; (2) a limit on the ability to dilute samples and still safely identify a single positive sample in a pool; (3) favorability of simple algorithms which may minimize human error in a laboratory setting.",

Second, we receive samples from prospectively screened asymptomatic populations such as hospital employees and workers in essential industries.

Individual barcoded samples were received at the laboratory, inactivated by lysis buffer, pooled on a Tecan liquid-handling robot, and the pools were processed on a Qiasymphony robot for RNA extraction, and analyzed by RT-PCR. Results were interpreted and samples in positive pools were subsequently individually tested. Note that analysis of pool results requires close attention to indeterminate-result pools, showing a signal at 35 < Ct < 38, as these may contain individual positive samples. Therefore, criteria for retesting pools must be more stringent, e.g. a signal with Ct ~38 would be defined as negative when individual samples are tested, but warrants re-testing of individual samples when encountered in a pool (see Table 1 , batch 3).",

Based on our experience with >2000 samples from asymptomatic individuals, we did not encounter any false positives in the pools, as shown in Figure 1 and Table 1 . False negatives are in principle more worrisome when testing in pools, because samples that failed at the RNA extraction step will be missed (while our individual testing includes amplification of a human transcript serving as an internal control for proper RNA extraction and RT-PCR of each sample). To define the magnitude of this potential problem, we examined a set of 13,781 tests done at our center, which were all expected to show a signal for a human gene serving as internal assay control. Amplification of the human gene failed in 52 samples (0.38% of the cases). Thus, we estimate that our current protocol of pooled sampling carries a risk of missing 0.38% of the positive samples. In a population of 1,000,000 individuals tested, of which 1,000 are positive (rate of 0.1%), this predicts that 4 positive individuals will be missed when using pools. We posit that this is a tolerable situation, particularly given the potentially much higher rates of false negative results due to swab sampling and other errors upstream.",

In the case that samples are not independent, and we have information regarding their dependency, we can try to further efficiency by grouping together dependent samples, that is, samples that are likely all positives or all negatives, such as members of the same family, or samples that are likely to be all negative since they have a low risk profile.

As expected, only 6 pools (one row and one column per matrix) were positive for SARS-COV-2, while 24 pools had Ct >40 (Undetected).
