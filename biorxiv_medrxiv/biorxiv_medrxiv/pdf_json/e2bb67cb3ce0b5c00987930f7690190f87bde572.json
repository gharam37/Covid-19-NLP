Herein, we investigated the potential of childhood vaccination, specifically against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), to identify if this could potentially confer acquired protection over SARS-CoV-2. We identified sequence homology between the fusion proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and measles and mumps viruses. Moreover, we also identified a 29% amino acid sequence homology between the Macro (ADP-ribose-1''-phosphatase) domains of SARS-CoV-2 and rubella virus. The rubella Macro domain has surface-exposed conserved residues and is present in the attenuated rubella virus in MMR. Hence, we hypothesize that MMR could protect against poor outcome in COVID-19 infection. As an initial test of this hypothesis, we identified that 1) age groups that most likely lack of MMR vaccine-induced immunity had the poorest outcome in COVID-19, and 2) COVID-19 disease burden correlates with rubella antibody titres, potentially induced by SARS-CoV2 homologous sequences. We therefore propose that vaccination of 'at risk' age groups with an MMR vaccination merits further consideration as a time appropriate and safe intervention.",

This is peculiar in a viral illness, as one would assume that the collective immunity accumulated over a lifetime would arm elderly populations with better defences than their progeny. A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that children are most likely and people 65 and older least likely to get sick from influenza. Median incidence values (or attack rate) by age group were 9.3% for children 0-17 years, 8.8% for adults 18-64 years, and 3.9% for adults 65 years and older [Tokars et al., 2018] . A simple answer to why COVID-19 is different could be that the elderly population do not have the physiological reserve or regeneration capacity to fight such a severe burden of disease. However, more intriguingly, the vaccination history of the individual patient might contribute to the severity of the disease.",

In the case of rubella, between 1962 and 1965 a pandemic, originating in Europe, spread to the United States leading to an estimated 12.5 million cases which caused significant disability to the foetus of pregnant mothers resulting in blindness, deafness and death [Ministry of Health, NZ, 2018] . Currently, the MMR vaccination is given in two doses and is offered to children between 9 and 15 months initially with a second dose at 15 months to 6 years of age [World Health Organisation, 2017] . The vaccination suffers from reduced uptake as a result of falsified claims of a link to autism [Editors of The Lancet, 2010]. There are, however, wide differences between national health systems and their sub-regions in the years when they formally introduced each vaccine in their childhood vaccination schedules, or when they established national campaigns to promote specific vaccines for vulnerable population [Hamborsky et al., 2015; World Health Organisation, 2019] .",

Residues conserved in the SARS-CoV-2 and rubella Macro domains include surface-exposed residues and residues required for ADP-ribose binding and ADRP enzymatic activity in other coronaviruses ( Fig. 1) . Notably, ADRP activity is required for a mouse coronavirus, MHV-A59 (mouse hepatitis virus A59), to cause acute hepatitis. Mutation of a single residue in the MHV-A59 Macro domain (N1348A) abrogates ADRP activity [Eriksson et al., 2008] . This residue is conserved in the Macro domains of SARS-CoV-2 and rubella. Together these observations suggest that ADRP activity could be important in COVID-19 and rubella pathogenesis.",

Although it is within a cytoplasmic non-structural protein, it could contribute to vaccine antigenicity if it released upon cell lysis, or displayed via MHC-I in vaccinated patients. Hence, we hypothesise that potentially immunogenic elements of the SARS-CoV-2 Macro domain that are conserved in rubella virus could serve as targets for B-or T-cell responses in patients who have had rubella or received a version of the vaccine. In this regard, we note certain antibodies raised against the S surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 [Wang et al., 2020; Lv et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020] , but it remains unclear to what extent non-neutralizing antibody cross-reactivity may lead to antibody-dependent enhancement [Lv et al., 2020] . Viral envelope glycoproteins catalyse an essential step in cell entry, fusion of the viral and cellular membrane. Coronavirus Spike glycoproteins are class I viral membrane fusion proteins. As such they share the same trimeric a-helical coiled-coil architecture as other class I fusogens including those from ortho-and paramyxoviruses [Walls et al., 2017; Skehel et al., 2000] . Structural homology searches with DALI [Holm et al., 2016] and molecular modelling with PHYRE2 [Kelley et al., 2015] confirmed clear structural homology between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and paramyxovirus F proteins, including both measles and measles F in the postfusion conformation (DALI Z-score 6.3; Fig. 2 ). Homologous sequences in SARS-CoV-2 S2 and measles, aligned in PSI-BLAST [Altschul et al., 1997] with an expected value of 10 -101 , with 20% sequence identity over a 369-amino acid region (Fig. 3 ).

In comparison, Immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels were 0.21+0.16 IU/ml in severe disease and 0.26+0.21 IU/ml in moderate disease. Whilst we accept that it is possible that this trend could be representative of preinfection protection to rubella infection, it is not possible to determine this. In a study of 160 women of child bearing age, the IgG levels of non-infected patients measured between 24-143 IU/ml, suggesting that it is unlikely that those who developed severe symptoms of the disease had IgG levels far in excess of this prior to infection [Seker et al., 2004] . To test the specificity of this antibody response and to exclude the possibility that SARS-CoV2 infection was not driving a non-specific antibody response, we tested the six patients with the (3 from severe and 3 from moderate category) highest IgG titres and performed an ELISA against a varicella zoster virus epitope. All 6 patients returned positive samples ranging 1.86-3.46 (Ab Index) with reports in the literature of a response to a VZV vaccination being around 690 (Ab Index) [Smith-Norowitz et al., 2018] . This is consistent with the hypothesis that patients are specifically responding to SARS-CoV2 by identifying homology to rubella.",

Equally, however, as with DV, the presence of higher concentrations of antibodies could exacerbate disease burden if the antibodies were not neutralising in nature [Halstead, 2007] . Here the increased severity of secondary infections is believed to be a result, at least partially, from antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of DV infection, in which Fc\u03b3R engagement by antibody-virus immune complexes facilitates virus entry into susceptible myeloid cell types [Halstead et al., 2003] . Interestingly, Balsitis et al., [2010] demonstrated that even when antibody levels were neutralising in vitro, cross-reactive polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies all enhanced disease in vivo. However, they also report complete elimination of viraemia with high-dose serotype-specific antibodies. Thus, we hypothesise that the administration of normal human immunoglobulin (NHIG) which contains antibodies against all three viruses would have the potential to rescue severe COVID-19 infection if administered in a timely fashion.",

To determine if there is a potential effect of MMR vaccinations, it would be necessary to know the vaccination status of younger patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of the disease. If there is a link, we propose that vaccination of 'at risk' age groups with an MMR vaccination should be considered as a time-appropriate and safe intervention. To create a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will be arduous and may require time which we simply cannot afford. Meanwhile, some help could be immediately available to those in the greatest need.",

The Macro domains of SARS-CoV-2 and rubella virus share 29% amino acid sequence identity. Interestingly, the residues conserved in the SARS-CoV-2 and rubella Macro domains include surface-exposed residues and are present in the attenuated rubella virus used in the MMR vaccine. We identified at a population level that both older populations and males are both more likely to die from COVID-19, and less likely to be seropositive for rubella-specific immunity, based on historical vaccination programmes of all three countries considered in this report. Finally, the hypothesis that this macro domain could be recognised by antibodies raised against rubella was supported by data that demonstrated that patients who have SARS-CoV2 infection had raised levels of rubella IgG to a level in keeping with secondary rubella infection. Taken together, we suggest that MMR will not prevent COVID-19 infection but could potentially reduce poor outcome. To conclude whether MMR vaccination can improve the outcomes from Covid-19 infection, a study using individual based data to compare MMR immunity status in the affected population is warranted.",
