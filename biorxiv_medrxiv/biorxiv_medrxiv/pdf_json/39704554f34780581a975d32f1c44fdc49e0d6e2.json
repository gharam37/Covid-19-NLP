The severe respiratory pneumonia 33 caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 has so far claimed more than 60,000 lives and has impacted 34 human lives worldwide. However, as the novel SARS-CoV-2 displays high transmission rates, 35 their underlying genomic severity is required to be fully understood. We studied the complete 36 genomes of 95 SARS-CoV-2 strains from different geographical regions worldwide to uncover 37 the pattern of the spread of the virus. We show that there is no direct transmission pattern of 38 the virus among neighboring countries suggesting that the outbreak is a result of travel of 39 infected humans to different countries. We revealed unique single nucleotide polymorphisms 40 (SNPs) in nsp13-16 (ORF1b polyprotein) and S-Protein within 10 viral isolates from the USA. 41",

Focusing on the edge-connection between the 211 neighboring countries from where the transmission is more likely to occur, we noted a strain 212 from Taiwan (MT066176) closely clustered with another from China (MT121215.1). With the 213 exception of these two strains, we did not find any connection between strains of neighboring 214 countries. Thus, most strains belonging to the same country clustered distantly from each other 215 and showed relatedness with strains isolated from distant geographical locations ( Figure 1A & 216 B). For instance, a SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from Nepal (MT072688) clustered with a strain 217 8 from USA (MT039888). Also, strains from Wuhan (LR757998 and LR757995), where the 218 virus was originated, showed highest identity with USA as well as China strains; strains from 219 India, MT012098 and MT050493 clustered closely with China and USA strains, respectively 220 ( Figure 1A & B) .

Notably, isolates from same country or geographical 224 location formed a mosaic pattern of phylogenetic placements of countries' isolates. For viral 225 transmission, contact between the individuals is also an important factor, supposedly due to 226 which the spread of identical strains across the border of neighboring countries is more likely. 227",

To 283 explore the role of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in host immune evasion, the SARSCoV-2 proteins 284 were mapped over host proteome database ( Figure 3B & Table 3 ). We identified a total of 28 285 proteins from host proteome forming close association with 25 viral proteins present in 9 ORFs 286 of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 3C ). The network was trimmed in Cytoscape v3.7.2 where only 287 interacting proteins were selected. Only 12 viral proteins were found to interact with host 288 proteins ( Figure 3A ). Detailed analysis of interactome highlighted 9 host proteins in direct 289 association with 6 viral proteins.

We identified mitogen activated protein kinase 1 291 Similarly, the viral protein Papain-like proteinase (PL-PRO) which has deubiquitinase and 309 deISGylating activity is responsible for cleaving viral polyprotein into 3 mature proteins which 310 are essential for viral replication [57] . Our study showed that PL-PRO directly interacts with 311 PPP1CA which is a protein phosphatase that associates with over 200 regulatory host proteins 312 to form highly specific holoenzymes. PL-PRO is also found to interact with TGF\u03b2 which is a 313 beta transforming growth factor and promotes T-helper 17 cells (Th17) and regulatory T-cells 314 (Treg) differentiation [58] .

Recently, Huang et al, 293 demonstrated the role of Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) in COVID-19 mediated 294 blood immune responses in infected patients [53] and showed that MAPK activation certainly 295 plays a major defense mechanism. 296 Gene Ontology based functional annotation studies predicted the role of direct interactions of 297 several viral proteins with host proteins. One such protein is non-structural protein2 (nsp2) 298 which directly interacts with host Prohibitin (PHB), a known regulator of cell proliferation and 299 maintains functional integrity of mitochondria [54]. SARS-CoV nsp2 is also known for its 300 interaction with host PHB1 and PHB2 [55]. Nsp2 is a methyltransferase like domain that is 301 known to mediate mRNA cap 2'-O-ribose methylation to the 5'-cap structure of viral 302 mRNAs. This N7-methylguanosine cap is required for the action of nsp16 (2'-O-303 methyltransferase) and nsp10 complex [56]. This 5'-capping of viral RNA plays a crucial role 304 in escape of virus from innate immunity recognition [56]. Hence, nsp2 -is responsible for 305 modulating host cell survival strategies by altering host cell environment [55]. Based on 306 network predicted we propose nsp16/nsp10 interface as a better drug target for anti-coronavirus 307 drugs corresponding to the prediction made by Chen and group (2011) [56]. 308",

Tan et al. (2007) have shown that SARS-CoV ORF7a protein 336 induces apoptosis by interacting with Bcl XL protein which is responsible for lymphopenia, an 337 abnormality found in SARS-CoV infected patients [66]. Another target of viral ORF7a protein 338 is SGTA (Small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat) which is an ATPase regulator and 339 promotes viral encapsulation [67]. Subordinate viral proteins M (Membrane), S (Glycoprotein) 340 and ORF3a (viroporin) were found to interact with each other. This interaction is important for 341 viral cell formation and budding [68, 69].
