However, infection with COVID-19 is currently rare in children. Objective: To discuss the latest findings and research focus on the basis of characteristics of children confirmed with COVID-19, and provide an insight into the future treatment and research direction. Methods: We searched the terms \"COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2\" AND \"Pediatric OR children\" on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, NIH, CDC, and CNKI. The authors also reviewed the guidelines published on Chinese CDC and Chinese NHC. Results: We included 25 published literature references related to the epidemiology, clinical manifestation, accessary examination, treatment, and prognosis of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: The numbers of children with COVID-19 pneumonia infection are small, and most of them come from family aggregation. Symptoms are mainly mild or even asymptomatic, which allow children to be a risk factor for transmission. Thus, strict epidemiological history screening is needed for early diagnosis and segregation. This holds especially for infants, who are more susceptible to infection than other age groups in pediatric age, but have most likely subtle and unspecific symptoms. They need to be paid more attention to. CT examination is a necessity for screening the suspected cases, because most of the pediatric patients are mild cases, and plain chest X-ray do not All rights reserved.

Therefore, early chest CT examination combined with pathogenic detection is a recommended clinical diagnosis scheme in children. The risk factors which may suggest severe or critical progress for children are: Fast respiratory rate and/or; lethargy and drowsiness mental state and/or; lactate progressively increasing and/or; imaging showed bilateral or multi lobed infiltration, pleural effusion or rapidly expending of lesions in a short period of time and/or; less than 3 months old or those who underly diseases. For those critical pediatric patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, polypnea may be the most common symptom. For treatment, the elevated PCT seen in children in contrast to adults suggests that the underlying coinfection/secondary infection may be more common in pediatric patients and appropriate antibacterial treatment should be considered. Once cytokine storm is found in these patients, anti-autoimmune or blood-purifying therapy should be given in time. Furthermore, effective isolation measures and appropriate psychological comfort need to be provided timely.",

CoV consists of four genera: \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 coronaviruses. The alpha-and beta-coronaviruses infect only mammals, while the gamma-and delta-coronaviruses mainly infect birds. COVID-19 belongs to the \u03b2 genus coronaviruses [1] . SARS-CoV-2 is a novel human coronavirus (HCoVs) besides four HCoVs ((\u03b1-coronaviruses (229E and NL63), \u03b2-coronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1)), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSr-CoV), as well as the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1] . It is an enveloped positive single-stranded RNA virus with 60-140 nm in diameter. The shape of SARS-CoV-2 is spherical or elliptical [4, 5] . The consistency of whole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-like coronavirus in bats (bat-SL-CoVZC45) ranges from 86.9% [5] to 89% [6] . \"The SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat, and it can be inactivated at 56\u2103 for 30 minutes.

The children confirmed with COVID-19 mostly have good prognosis. A single child patient passed away; for other child patients, progression of the disease was observed as mild [9, 10] . Yet, in more general, infectious diseases often tend to behave less aggressively in child patients. For severe respiratory distress syndrome (SARS), the total death ratio is reported within 7% to 17%. For individuals with less than 24 years of age, the death ratio is 0% compared to 50% mortality rates in adults older than 65 years [9] . Looking at those cases of COVID-19 judged as severe, children's rate is also considerably below adults' rate (49.0%, 1023/2087) [19] . The main explanation would be:1. One possible reason is that children have been protected well resulting in lower potential exposure with the virus due to considerably lower travelling track record and potentially relatively higher indoor time. 2. Children possess more active innate immune systems, including mostly fully functional lungs owing to low exposure to smoking induced and other air pollution. 3. Children do not really have complex underlying disorders. 4.The differences in distribution, maturation and function of viral receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) are usually named a potential cause for age-based differences in infection rate. ACE2 was already considered a cell receptor for SARS-CoV [9] . Recent reports indicate that ACE2 in ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes is also likely the binding receptor for SARS-CoV-2. A usual theory for children's lower sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 is based on their less maturity and lower function of ACE2 compared with that in adults [9] .",

A largely asymptomatic infant with COVID-19 with high viral load was reported in Singapore, and this case highlights the difficulties in establishing the true incidence of COVID-19, as asymptomatic individuals may play important roles in human-to-human transmission in the community [13] . A study focused on 24 asymptomatic infections identified that the infection period of asymptomatic patients may be as long as three weeks, and the infected patients may develop into serious diseases [14] . Furthermore, the bad habits of young children such as sucking hands, putting their hands all around and unwilling to wash hands could be important risk factors in contact transmission for children. Thus, it is necessary to guarantee family daily prevention to keep children from COVID-19 infection and assure awareness of the importance of its early diagnosis. Also, during the epidemic period, children's health clinics and vaccination clinics should be reduced reasonably, and parent-child activities, kindergartens, primary schools, and other group activities related to children should be suspended. In clinical case, screening was mostly based on the epidemiological track record. Additional basis were raised body temperature and symptoms of the respiratory tract. For children, it is more important to trace close contact history, and pathogen examination needs to be timely executed along with longitudinal monitoring through viral nucleic acid detection. Further isolation recommendations and ongoing nucleic acid testing are also recommended for discharged patients [14] . Additionally, it appears crucial to follow up with infants'respiratory as well as gastrointestinal symptoms and vital indications steadily, which is the most susceptible population in children, at mild onset that could progress into severe at a later stage [11] .",

            "text": "In conclusion, the numbers of children with COVID-19 pneumonia infection are small, and most of them come from family aggregation. Symptoms are mainly mild or even asymptomatic which allow children to be a risk factor for transmission. Thus, strict epidemiological history screening is needed for early diagnosis and segregation. This holds especially for infants, who are more susceptible to infection than other age groups in pediatric age, but have most likely subtle and unspecific symptoms. They need to be paid more attention to. CT examination is a necessity for screening the suspected cases, because the majority of the young COVID-19 infected are classified as mild infection, and plain chest X-ray mostly gives not sufficient insight into the lesions or lung details. Therefore, early chest CT examination combined with pathogenic recognition is a recommended clinical diagnosis scheme in children. The risk factors which may suggest severe or critical progress for children are: Fast respiratory rate and/or; lethargy and drowsiness mental state and/or; lactate progressively increasing and/or; imaging showed bi-or multi-lobed infiltration, pleural effusion, or rapidly expending of lesions in a short period of time and/or; less than 3 months old or those who underly diseases. For those critical pediatric patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, polypnea may be the most common symptom. For treatment, the elevated PCT seen in children in contrast to adults suggests that the underlying coinfection/secondary infection may be more common in pediatric patients and appropriate antibacterial treatment should be considered. Once cytokine storm is found in these patients, anti-autoimmune or bloodpurifying therapy should be given in time. Finally, it is of crucial importance to assure early isolation combined with best possible psychological support for the young patients.",
