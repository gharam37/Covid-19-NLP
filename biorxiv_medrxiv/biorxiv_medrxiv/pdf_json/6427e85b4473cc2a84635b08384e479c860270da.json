The average age of the patients was 49.16 years. A total of 51.46% of the patients 29 were men and 52.32% were non-smokers. Hypertension (50.82%) and diabetes (20.89%) were 30 the most frequent comorbidities observed. The most common symptoms were fever (83.21%), 31 cough (61.74%), and myalgia or fatigue (30.22%).

For the former, it is believed that X chromosome 142 inactivation in females may cause cellular mosaicism which ensures the presence of at least 143 one functional copy of X-linked immune genes, thus conferring women an increased resistance 144 against viral infections (75). In addition, estrogen, the major female sex hormone, is known to 145 promote adaptive immune response (76), while testosterone, the primary sex hormone in men, 146 could contribute to the suppression of the innate immune response, rendering men more 147 susceptible to viral infections (77, 78). On the other hand, cigarette smoking may reduce the 148 level of circulating immunoglobulins, immune cells, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as 149 disrupt the response of antibodies to antigens (72). For these reasons, some studies have 150 suggested that men and smokers are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infections (3, 79). In the 151 present work, we noted that the ratios of male to female and smokers to non-smokers were 152 close to 1:1.

This 165 contradicts with advisories and guidelines published by many health authorities, which suggest 166 that dyspnea is a commonly observed symptom in . Besides, it was observed 167 that 0.80% of the patients were asymptomatic. Currently, whether asymptomatic patients can 168 transmit the virus to other individuals is not fully known, but it is highly possible (35). Thus, 169 although the number of asymptomatic patients was low, identifying and isolating such patients 170 to prevent uncontrolled disease spread would prove very challenging. It is therefore important 171 for diagnostic tests to be performed on asymptomatic medium-and high-risk individuals to 172 facilitate early detection and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In addition to nucleic acid 173 testing using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, some studies have 174 suggested the potential usability of chest CT for COVID-19 diagnosis (90, 91). However, in the 175 present work, we found that 5.86% of the patients did not have abnormalities on CT scans. Thus, 176 although CT findings have substantial accuracy in identifying the disease (90, 91), the results need 177 to be interpreted with caution. 178 179 SARS-CoV-2 is known to infect a cell by first binding to its angiotensin converting 180 enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (92).
