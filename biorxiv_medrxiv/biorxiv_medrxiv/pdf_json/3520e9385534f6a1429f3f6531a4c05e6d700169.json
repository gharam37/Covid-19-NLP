We apply a Bayesian adaptive patient-centered model-which minimizes the expected harm of false positives and false negatives-to optimize the clinical trial development path during such outbreaks. When the epidemic is more infectious and fatal, the Bayesian-optimal sample size in the clinical trial is lower and the optimal statistical significance level is higher. For COVID-19 (assuming a static 2 and initial infection percentage of 0.1%), the optimal significance level is 7.1% for a clinical trial of a non-vaccine anti-infective therapeutic clinical trial and 13.6% for that of a vaccine. For a dynamic ranging from 2 to 4, the corresponding values are 14.4% and 26.4%, respectively. Our results illustrate the importance of adapting the clinical trial design and the regulatory approval process to the specific parameters and stage of the epidemic.",

To address this gap, developed an adaptive version of the Bayesian patient-centered model that achieves an optimal balance between Type I and Type II error rates, significantly reducing the number of subjects needed in trials to achieve a statistically significant conclusion. A key feature of this model is the time evolution of the loss function of the Bayesian decision algorithm.

Such a program might involve provisional approval of a candidate therapy consisting of a one-or two-year license-depending on the nature of the drug-indication pair-to market the therapy to a pre-specified patient population, no offlabel use of the therapy, and regular monitoring and data reporting to the regulator by the manufacturer and/or patients' physicians during the licensing period (Lo, 2017) . At the end of this trial period, one of two outcomes would occur, depending on the accumulated data during this period: (a) the \"urgent needs\" license expires; or (b) the license converts to the traditional regulatory license. Of course, at any point during the trial period, the regulator can terminate the license if the data show that the therapeutic is ineffective and/or unsafe.",
