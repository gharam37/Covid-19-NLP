Malarial transmission may give some protection against COVID-19. One explanation may be community level use of drugs such as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in malaria-endemic countries and relative non-use of them in malaria-free countries. Interestingly chloroquine has been shown to be effective in reduction of viral replications including COVID-19. 8, 9 Hydroxychloroquine has some immunomodulatory action and after the outbreak, studies have shown some activity of this drug. 10 Viral inhibition from possibly higher blood level in malaria-endemic countries is one postulation.
