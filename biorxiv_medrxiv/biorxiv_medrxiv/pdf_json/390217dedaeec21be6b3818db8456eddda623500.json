Therefore, the contribution of a coefficient was weighted proportionally to the reduction in the sums of squares. For the elastic net model, the selected variables were those of coefficients that did not shrink to 0. For the random forest model, the prediction accuracy for the out-of-bag portion of the data was recorded for each tree. Then, the same procedure was performed after permuting each predictor variable. The difference between the two accuracies was then averaged across all the trees and normalized by the standard error. 9 For the bagged FDA model, a series of cutoffs were applied to the predictor data to predict the class. The AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity were computed for each cutoff. The trapezoidal rule was used to compute the AUROC, which was used as the measure of variable importance. 10 The top 20 most important variables selected by the five models are shown in Figure 2A -E. We chose the intersection set of these variables. Four variables were finally selected (age, hsCRP, lymphocyte count, and d-dimer). The five models were refitted using these four variables.

[13] [14] [15] The number of laboratory-confirmed patients as well as the number of related deaths are continuously increasing. The fatality rate might further increase along with the increasing number of infected people, because even the most advanced healthcare systems are likely to be overwhelmed. 16, 17 The Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported that out of more than 70,000 confirmed cases, most of them were classified as mild or moderate, and approximately 20% were classified as severe or critical. 18 Even if we assume that the fatality rate is 10% in severe and critically ill cases, 4 the number of COVID-19 induced deaths is considerable because of the enormous number of infected patients. Identifying the patients at high risk of death is critical for patient management and to reduce the fatality rate. In this clinical prediction modeling study, we took full advantage of the multifaceted data of COVID-19 patients at admission to predict their outcomes. Four variables (i.e., age, hsCRP, d-dimer, and lymphocyte count) were selected and used to fit a logistic regression model. The predictive performance of our model was acceptable in both the derivation set and the external validation set. We also developed a web tool to implement our predictive model. Clinicians can use this web tool to predict the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients early. For those patients with a relatively higher probability of death (e.g., >40%), more interventions could be adopted at an earlier stage by clinicians to reduce the mortality risk.",

This percentage may explain, in part, Italy's higher case-fatality rate compared with that of other countries. 20 In our study, age was selected as a key factor in all the predictive models. The age-dependent deterioration in immunological competence (e.g., B-cell and T-cell deficiencies), often referred to as \"immunosenescence\", and the excess production of type 2 cytokines could lead to a deficiency in the control of viral replication and more prolonged proinflammatory responses, potentially leading to a poor outcome. 21, 22 In this study, the deceased patients had persistent and more severe lymphopenia compared with recovered patients and the lymphocyte count was selected and incorporated into the predictive model. Defects in function of lymphocytes are age-dependent and are associated with inflammation levels. 23, 24 Additionally, hsCRP, the most commonly used inflammatory biomarker in the clinic, was selected for our predictive models. Patients with higher levels of hsCRP at admission were deemed to have higher levels of inflammation. In our study, we found that the hsCRP level was more than 6 times higher in the nonsurvivors than in the survivors. Although the levels of other inflammatory biomarkers, such as ferritin and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, were also elevated in the nonsurvivors, they were not selected and incorporated in the predictive model. This omission might be explained by the higher missing rates of these covariates and their high correlation with hsCRP. Coagulation disorder, characterized by an elevated prothrombin time and d-dimer level, was also frequently observed among COVID-19 patients. 25, 26 In our study, the prothrombin time and d-dimer were significantly higher in the non-survivors than in the survivors.

First, to our knowledge, this is the first study for predicting the outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients based on comprehensive data. Second, to ensure the robustness of our predictive model, we enforced strict inclusion and exclusion criteria on the included participants and study data. Third, we used advanced modeling strategies to select features and to construct the predictive models. The final model is simple (it included only four variables) and highly interpretable (the model is a linear model, and the effects of the predictors are reflected by the regression coefficients). Moreover, we externally validated the final predictive model. Fourth, we developed an accompanying web tool to facilitate the application of our predictive model by clinicians.

Third, patients were sometimes transferred from other hospitals to the two branches of Tongji hospitals, although we excluded patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria. The values of the laboratory tests might be biased by prior antiviral treatment in these patients. Finally, the patients in the derivation set and the validation set were from Tongji Hospital, which is one of the hospitals with a high level of medical care in China. Some critically ill patients recovered here might die in other hospitals with suboptimal or typical levels of medical care.
