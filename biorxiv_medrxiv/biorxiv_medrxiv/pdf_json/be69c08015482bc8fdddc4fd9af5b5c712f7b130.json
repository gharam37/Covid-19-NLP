As of March 28, 2020, 191 countries, areas, or territories have reported a total of 571,659 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 26,493 deaths, with substantial outbreaks emerging in Italy, the Republic of Korea, Iran, and the United States, which surpassed China to become the country with the highest cumulative confirmed cases [2, 3] .",

In our simulations, the median cumulative number of symptomatic COVID-19 cases by March 14th was 23 (IQR: 17-32) and 9.0 (IQR: 5.8-13) assuming a four-day and seven-day doubling period, respectively; by May 14th, median cumulative symptomatic cases climbed to 508,546 (IQR: 104,535-766,109) and 6,759 (IQR: 1,901-12,353), respectively.",
