As of today, many of the published studies lack a sufficient 194 number of cases or presented only retrospective results with partially incomplete information due to 195 challenges in data acquisition. Thus, many studies conclude that there is a need for a broader and 196 larger study with systematic data acquisition in the immediate future10,12  . However, these studies 197 provide first data eligible for inclusion in a systematic prospective study protocol. We created the eCRF 198 based on the data extracted from the current studies. As Radiologists become more familiar with 199 radiological findings in line with COVID-19 pneumonia, the proposed eCRF will help to contribute 200 substantially to diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 infection and facilitate pooling of international 201 knowledge.

The rapid, pandemic spread showed, 203 that an extensive preparation and adjustment of healthcare systems is crucial to be able to respond 204 appropriately and timely. We hope that the structured guidance through the radiological assessment205 together with the pooled information gathered from other sites might contribute to flatten the 206 learning curve and thus improve clinical management of patients suffering from COVID-19 infection.207Furthermore, resource scarcity in relation to the number of cases has been widely experienced by 208 means of medical consumables and infrastructure but also a shortage of health care professionals.
