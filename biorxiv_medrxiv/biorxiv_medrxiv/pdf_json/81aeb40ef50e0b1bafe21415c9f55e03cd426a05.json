Studies in Wuhan, including 13 to 199 severe cases identified using different criteria, reported high case-fatality rate from 19\u00b72 to 61.5%. [3] [4] [5] A recent case series in the US that included 21 patients also reported a rate up to 67%. 6 Meanwhile, data from other regions outside Wuhan in China, reported much lower case-fatality rate ranging from zero to 6\u00b75%. [7] [8] [9] [10] In other countries with a relatively low case-fatality rate in all COVID-19 patients, very limited data were reported regarding severe cases. These studies provided valuable data regarding epidemiological, clinical, and biological characteristics, and treatment of the severe COVID-19. However, the reason for the discrepancy in fatality rate remained unclear. As no rigorous evidence has been published regarding the effectiveness of any treatment for COVID-19, it is likely that this discrepancy across regions could not be explained by the difference in the level of medical care or by any single therapeutic agent.

According to data reported in studies from Wuhan and a study from the US, IV was administered in 38\u00b79-71% patients. 6, 22, 26 However, in our study, IV was used in only 12\u00b73% of the patients and the case-fatality rate was much lower than that in these studies. This difference may be explained, at least in part, by the timing of intervention. 11 It is reasonable to hypothesize that hypoxemia may participate in multiple organ injury if the hypoxic compensatory period was overlooked or not treated timely. 30 Our study showed that, if severely ill patients can be identified earlier, traditional oxygen therapy and close monitoring may suffice, as in the 42% of the patients in our study. Given that the COVID-19 outbreak is moving rapidly, this finding is of particular interest for treating newly diagnosed severe cases and for regions facing a shortage of ventilators. Preparing a large availability of conventional oxygen therapy and providing it in an early stage, in hospital or even at home, might be the most cost-efficient alternative for improving the prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients and to relieve the burden of the whole medical system.",
