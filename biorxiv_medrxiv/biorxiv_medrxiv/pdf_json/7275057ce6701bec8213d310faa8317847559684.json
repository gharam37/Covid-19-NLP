Results: The initial screening identified 517 articles. After examination of the full texts, 22 seventeen studies met the review's eligibility criteria. Great homogeneity was observed 23 in the findings regarding the effect of temperature and humidity on the seasonal viability 24 and transmissibility of COVID-19. Cold and dry conditions were potentiating factors on 25 the spread of the virus. After quality assessment, four studies had a high risk of bias and 26 thirteen studies were scored as moderate risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was 27 graded as low for both outcomes evaluated.",

On the other hand, several meteorological factors combined together could describe the epidemic trend much better than single-factor models. Significant impact of daily mean temperature on the daily confirmed new case counts 14 days later. It is supposed that a sufficient time delay between exposure and confirmation is crucial for weather to exhibit its effect. There are relatively narrow temperature and humidity ranges for SARS-CoV-2 spread, there is an optimal temperature for SARS-CoV-2 at 8.07 \u2103 and most cities with high epidemic transmission of COVID-19 are located in the humidity range of 60% ~ 90%. The results suggest that temperature has a huge effect on how rapidly the SARS-CoV-2 spreads during certain conditions. The author recommends that southern hemisphere countries prepare for increasing caseload, and northern hemisphere countries limit air conditioning. Great heterogeneity was observed in relation to the displayed variables, that included other weather conditions beyond temperature and humidity [9, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] like wind speed, [20, 32] visibility, [24] precipitation, [25, 27] pressure, [20] rainfall rate, [20] snowfall rate, [20] snow depth, [20] surface downward short-wave irradiation. [20] A heterogeneity was also observed regarding the date of data collection, both in relation to the location studied, and the date of epidemiological data collection of COVID-19 and climatic conditions.",

Only one article reported no strong effect of temperature and humidity in the spread of the virus. [32] It was also noticed that several meteorological factors combined could better describe the epidemic trend than when a single variable was analyzed.

These factors were only identified in five of the thirteen selected articles.

Heat intolerance of the virus is probably related to the breakdown of their lipid bilayer, [39] in a similar model to what occurs with the predecessor of the new coronavirus, the SARS-CoV.

[11, 38] The main reasons are: the virus is more stable in cold temperatures, and respiratory droplets, as containers of viruses, remain in suspension longer in dry air. [44] Cold and dry weather can also demote the hosts' immunity and make them more susceptible to the virus. [45] Many respiratory pathogens show seasonality and the human activity patterns and immunity can be influenced by environmental factors limited during the COVID-19 outbreak, due to the absence of extreme climatic conditions and specific immunity for a newly emerging virus. [35] Cold air temperature contributes to spread of viruses, including coronavirus, and the possibility of infection. Some possible reasons are: low temperature provides suitable survival and reproduction conditions for coronavirus; [46] cold air causes vasoconstriction of the respiratory tract which contributes to weakening of the immune system; and dry cold air makes the nasal mucosa prone to small ruptures, thereby creating opportunities for virus invasion. [47] In contrast, a long period of low or extremely cold temperature played a positive role in reducing the transmission of the coronavirus. [9, 22] In addition, Bukhari et al. [23] discuss another hypothesis for the lower number of COVID-19 cases detected in the tropics. It could be due to less mass testing as many of the underdeveloped countries that presents deficiency in the health care system and may have not done enough testing to detect the actual spread of this virus.",

Population migration is another key factor in the spread process that cannot be ignored, [25] as well as community structure, social dynamics, and global connectivity. [23] In cities with higher levels of population density, the virus is expected to spread faster than that in less crowded cities. [30] Al-Rousan et al. [20] suggested that international governments should adopt rigorous public policies. This can be done by increasing the number of health professionals and hospitals, and socially isolating mainly the suspected cases. Better health care facilities tend to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. [30] The relatively fast outbreak, associated with imperfect daily reporting practices, make a vast underreporting of new cases of COVID-19. Travel limitations and other control interventions need to be implemented consistently. [28] Additionally, Gupta [33] recommended that all citizens be required to wear a face mask whenever they go out, because the primarily viral infection is through airborne or close contact. The Chinese government used this as a key tool in managing the disease, especially with asymptomatic infected people.",
