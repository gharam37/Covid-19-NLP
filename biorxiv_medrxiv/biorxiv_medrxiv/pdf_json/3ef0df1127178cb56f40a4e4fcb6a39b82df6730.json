The cornerstones of prevention efforts have included 69 extensive testing, contact tracing and isolation and various forms of social 70 distancing/quarantining [3, 4] . Whilst there have been important differences in how 71 these were implemented in different countries, arguably the most striking difference 72 in approach has been in the use of universal face masks in public.

It is important to note that this association 187 may be entirely explained by unmeasured confounders. For example, if countries 188 promoting universal face masking also conducted more effective contact tracing and 189 isolation than other countries and this was responsible for the slower spread, our 190 study design would have falsely attributed this effect to using face masks. We did not 191 have accurate data to control for these confounders. We did however control for 192 testing intensity which is an important potential confounder. We also controlled for 193 the age of the epidemic which is an obvious independent determinant of the size of 194 the epidemic. A further limitation of our study was that we were unable to quantitate CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

A striking omission from this response-list if we compare it to the 212 responses in China and other Asian countries with lower COVID-19 incidence is that 213 the widespread use of face masks in public was not promoted. The only European 214 country to adopt this strategy was Czechia, and it did so at a relatively late stage in 215 the epidemic [19, 20] . Early indications suggest that despite higher testing rates than 216 the average for western European countries, the number of new infections is lower in 217",
