Methods: Cross-sectional online survey of 1,034 U.S. residents age 18+ conducted on March 17, 2020. Results: For every point increase in knowledge, the odds of participation in purchasing more goods (OR=0.88, 95% CI:0.81-0.95), attending large gatherings (OR=0.87, 95%CI: 0.81-0.93), and using medical masks (OR=0.56, 95% CI:0.50-0.62) decreased by 12%, 13%, and 44%, respectively. Gen X and Millennial participants had 56% to 76% higher odds, respectively, of increased purchasing behavior, compared to Baby Boomers. Results suggest politicization of response recommendations. Democrats had 30% lower odds of attending large gatherings (OR=0.70, 95% CI:0.50-0.97), and 48% lower odds of using medical masks (OR=0.52, 95% CI:0.34-0.78), compared to Republicans.",

In the face of the current pandemic, this requires the public to understand and trust those who are making recommendations to limit exposure and spread of illness. The deficit model of PUS posits that a lack of support for science (and a subsequent rejection of recommendations) is due to a lack of understanding about science, and if scientists can find a way to fill this knowledge deficit, then support for science will increase. A more contemporary view of PUS is that the public's knowledge is not deficient, but rather there is a deficit in trust in science, and in scientific experts specifically. Because of an increasing lack of trust in these institutions, Solomon 11 observed that there is an increased personal rejection of science which then leads to lower levels of scientific literacy and understanding of science. Low literacy and understanding may influence people to not follow recommendations for addressing science-based problems, as evident with the current pandemic.",

Results are mixed as to whether increased knowledge leads to positive attitudes (variously described as trust, support, confidence, and support for funding) about science. Allum et al 12 observed a small positive correlation between knowledge about science and positive attitudes about science and Miller 13 reports that there is public support for science even in the face of a scientific literacy rate of 20%. The public's support for science is necessary when addressing many important social issues, including an immediate need for the public to understand, and trust, the science about the novel Coronavirus pandemic currently plaguing the world. If the public does not trust the underlying science about these issues and does not trust in institutions that are tasked with managing this threat, it will be difficult to count on public support for policies to address these issues.

There is some debate whether the federal government even the Constitutional authority and so individual states are left to make decisions about \"shelter at home\" policies and similar efforts. As of this writing, California, Illinois, New York, Washington, Michigan, Massachusetts, Indiana, Oregon, and West Virginia have issued stay-at-home orders.

As such, the argument for banning wet markets in China is gaining momentum, but knowledge about proximity to animals, as opposed to using them as a food source, might be conflated. In addition, knowledge regarding who is most at risk for COVID-19 may change as the pandemic proceeds, as well as with experiences in different countries. For instance, fewer younger people in China were infected, while in the U.S. a different pattern appears to be emerging 29 . Next, this was a convenience sample of U.S. residents from every state in the country, but people were able to self-select based on their interest and experience with the topic. It is possible that sample demographics may not completely represent the U.S. public.

            "text": ", political party identification significantly influenced knowledge about COVID-19 as well as behaviors related to attending large gatherings and wearing medical masks. To summarize, Republicans had lower knowledge and had higher odds of attending large gatherings and wearing masks in public compared to Democrats and/or Independents. These behaviors directly contradict recommendations by both the CDC and NIH. In the U.S. there is a widening gap in trust in science and science-based recommendations based on political party 22 which may contribute to the observation here that Republicans are more likely to ignore recommendations about the COVID-19 response. In addition, the results reported here agree findings that there are political divisions over the role of scientific experts in policy matters 23 . That is, Democrats want expert involvement and believe scientists should be involved in policy recommendations.",

To set the context for the setting of the study, at the time the survey was released, there were 5,704 COVID-19 cases reported in the U.S. and 195,957 worldwide. At the date of this writing (March 24, 2020) there were 46,548 cases in the U.S. and 396,249 worldwide 27 . It is likely that these numbers vastly underrepresent the actual prevalence. On average it took four minutes to complete the survey (equivalent to $15/hour). Participants were 37.11 years old ranging from 19 to 77, 45% had completed a bachelor's degree, 75.8% reported white race, 58.2% were male, 35% reported income between $30,000 and $59,999, and 47.1% identified as Democrats. Additional demographic information is included in Table 1. Results for each of the COVID-19 knowledge questions are included in Table 1. Correct answers for questions ranged from 52.3% correct (Eating or contacting wild animals would result in COVID-19 infection -False) to 94.1% (Individuals should avoid large crowds to prevent infection with COVID-19 -True). The mean knowledge score was 9.72 (standard deviation=1.93, range 0-12) for an overall correct percentage of approximately 80%, lower than the 90% correct rate that Zhong at al 14 report in their sample of Chinese citizens at approximately two months into the outbreak.",

Exponentiating the unstandardized parameter estimate indicates that predicted mean knowledge scores for Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Z are 42%, 53%, and 73%, respectively, lower than Baby Boomers. Black/African Americans have mean knowledge scores that are 70% lower (b=-1.19, P<0.001) compared to Whites. In general, participants with higher incomes have higher knowledge scores. Finally, Democrats (b=0.76, P<0.001), and Independents (b=0.57, P<0.001) have mean knowledge scores that are 113% and 76% higher, respectively, than Republicans. Binary logistic regression analysis (Table 3) results reveal several predictors of each behavior. Self-reports of buying more goods than usual is negatively associated with COVID-19 knowledge. For every point increase in knowledge score, the odds of reporting unusual buying behavior decreased by 12% (OR=0.88, 95% CI:0.81-0.95). In the context of generational groups, the odds of reporting purchasing behavior increased by 76% and 56% for Gen X participants (OR=1.76, 95% CI:1.03-3.01) and Millennials (OR=1.56, 95% CI:1.01-2.41), respectively, compared to Baby Boomers. Next, people with higher education were associated with increased buying behaviors. The odds of unusual purchasing behavior increased by 88% and 111% for people with bachelor's degrees (OR=1.88, 95% CI:1.19-2.97), and Graduate/Professional degrees (OR=2.11, 95% CI:1.22-3.65), respectively, compared to those with a high school education. Finally, those with higher incomes had increased odds of unusual purchasing behavior. Next, for every point increase in knowledge scores, the odds of attending large gatherings in the last five days decreased by 13% (OR=0.87, 95% CI:0.81-0.93). Participants with Graduate/Professional degrees had 67% greater odds (OR=1.67, 95% CI:1.46-4.87) of attending large gatherings, compared to those with a high school education. Finally, Democrats had 30% Last, for every point increase in knowledge scores, the odds of wearing a mask outside the home decreased by 44% (OR=0.56, 95% CI:0.50-0.62). The largest effect of any of the analyses revealed that those with a bachelor's degree (OR=4.47, 95% CI:2.00-9.97), and Graduate/Professional degrees (OR=7.41, 95% CI:3.07-17.91) had 347% and 641% increased odds of wearing masks outside the home, compared to respondents with a high school education. Black/African American participants had 148% increased odds (OR=2.48, 95% CI:1.52-4.07) of wearing masks outside the home compared to Whites.
