Transitions between compartments are modelled either as instantaneous rates in differential equations, or as transition probabilities in discrete time difference or matrix equations. These models give accurate estimates of the position of equilibrium points, when the rate at which individuals enter each stage is equal to the rate at which they exit from it. However, they do not accurately capture the distribution of times that an individual spends in each compartment, so do not accurately capture the transient dynamics of epidemics. Here we show how matrix models can provide a straightforward route to accurately model stage durations, and thus correctly reproduce epidemic dynamics. We apply this approach to modelling the dynamics of a COVID-19 epidemic. We show that a SEIR model underestimates peak infection rates (by a factor of three using published parameter estimates based on the progress of the epidemic in Wuhan) and substantially overestimates epidemic persistence after the peak has passed.",

Standard compartment models of disease, such as SEIR, are being widely used to model the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic (Berger, Herkenhoff, & Mongey, 2020; Danon, Brooks-Pollock, Bailey, & Keeling, 2020; Fang, Nie, & Penny, 2020; Huang, Yang, Dai, Tian, & Chen, 2020; Kucharski et al.; Pan et al., 2020; Prem et al.; Read, Bridgen, Cummings, Ho, & Jewell, 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Teslya et al., 2020; Wu, Leung, & Leung, 2020; C. Yang & Wang, 2020; Z. Yang et al., 2020) . This model groups all \"exposed\" and \"infective\" individuals into single compartments. The rate at which susceptible individuals acquire infection is a function of the number of infective individuals present (as well as infectivity and contact rates). But these models express other transitions from one compartment to the next as the reciprocal of the average time that an individual spends in the first compartment. In the simplest SEIR formulation, exposed individuals spend T e days before becoming infective and infective individuals spend T i days before recovering [or dying], so the transition rates from E to I and from I to R are functions of T e -1 and T i -1 respectively. So the models do not track information on the time at which an individual was exposed or when they became infective.",

At the end of the incubation period, these will display symptoms and become I's. If secondary infection is not possible, not further individuals will enter into the E compartment and individuals in I will remain in this compartment for the infective period before transitioning to R, unless they die.

Infected and recovered individuals start to appear on day 2 and day 3 respectively. Numbers of infected individuals peak on day 9, but only 32% of the population is infected at this point, with 44% remaining in the E compartment and 24% already recovered. Appreciable numbers of infected individuals are still present after day 40. We have also used the same expressions for infection rates in an explicit time SEIR matrix formulation that generates a fixed length latent period (Fig. 2b) , and an infective period of 10 days for 75% of individuals and 11 days for the remaining 25%. This correctly shows 100% of the population moving from exposed to infective on day 8, and all individuals recovering by day 19.",

This means that they have distributions of residence times in each stage that only resemble reality to the extent of having the same expected values, with radically different values of all higher moments. This has been known for some time (Krylova & Earn, 2013; Lloyd, 2001a Lloyd, , 2001b Wearing et al., 2005) and solutions to the challenge are available (Krylova & Earn, 2013; Lloyd, 2001b) . But the huge simplicity of compartment models relative to Erlang distributed; integro-differential or delay differential models has meant that they have continued to play a prominent role in disease modelling, including many published papers modelling COVID-19 (see introduction). However, their discarding of information on the length of time individuals have been in a compartment creates serious deficiencies in the ability of compartment models to replicate the dynamics of real epidemics, such as COVID-19. In the examples examined here, including a model using parameter values based on COVID-19 dynamics in Wuhan, SEIR models underestimate the proportion of the population that will be Infected when the epidemic is at its peak and overestimate the epidemic duration, by factors of three and two respectively. The models in this paper show that the peak of infection in our explicit time model may be either earlier or later than the peak in the simple SEIR model. The implications of our findings for state policies to manage of COVID-19 epidemics are not clear. If SEIR models use parameter values estimated independently from data they will underestimate the proportion of the population which will be infected at the epidemic's peak. But if inverse modelling uses SEIR models to estimate parameters from disease time series (Fang et al., 2020) , they may give parameter estimates that are too pessimistic. Another consideration is Wearing et al. (2005) assessment that the standard models overestimate the effectiveness of quarantine and underestimate the importance of early detection.",

But the domination of the published scientific literature by compartment models may be in danger of creating a discontinuity between the views held in the research community and the modelling that is informing national decision making about the management of COVID-19. We believe that the approach outlined here provides a valuable solution to the problem of incorporating a time dimension within each compartment. This allows the correct recreation of time dynamics within each compartment, while retaining the simplicity of a matrix based model and the details of the model's assumptions can immediately be seen by examining the projection matrix.",

This formulation assumes that individuals are not infectious during the latent period. These authors used initial parameter estimates of \u03b2 0 = 0.1; k = 10; T e = 7 and T i = 10.25 and a population size of 10 million. We have formulated this as a discrete time SEIR model with a time step of one day (see supplementary material).",
