Our design philosophy is not only to try to address potential ventilator shortages, but also to account for uncertainties in the supply chains of parts commonly used in traditional ventilators. To do so we employ a modular design approach and broadly explore taking advantage of parts from non-traditional supply chains. In our current prototype, we demonstrate volume control with assist control on a test lung and present a linear actuator-driven pinch valve-based implementation for both pressure control and volume control with decelerating inspiratory flow. We estimate the component cost of the system to be around $500. We publish our draft design documents and current implementation which is open and accessible in the hope that broadening the community globally will accelerate arriving at a solution and that peer review will improve the final design.",

Early reports suggest that up to 20% of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop severe disease requiring hospitalization, with up to 25% of hospitalized patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission [2] . Many of the COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU present with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the clinical management of which involves intubation and mechanical ventilation which can last two weeks.",

Not only is the number of critical care ventilators limited, even the production capacity of the global medical device industry is insufficient to meet demand [5] . Furthermore, many low-capacity healthcare settings across the world are projected to face extreme shortages of ventilators and ICU beds for COVID-19 patients: recent reports found that the Central African Republic (pop. 4.8M) has a total of three suitable ventilators [6] , while South Sudan (pop. 11.7M) has four ventilators [7] , Northeast Syria has 11 ventilators [7] , Northwest Syria (pop. 3M) has 30 adult ventilators [7] , Burkina Faso (pop. 20.9M) and Sierra Leone (pop. 7.9M) both have between 10 and 15 ventilators [7] , Indonesia (pop. 267M) has approximately 8400 ventilators [8] , and India (pop. 1.3B) has approximately 20,000 ventilators [9] .",

So far we have functionally tested the implementation based on the Jetson Nano. Photos of the prototyping system and core components used in the prototype are shown in Figure 2 . The total cost of the core components for this minimum system is around $200 (excluding the battery). As part of the development process and for initial tests, we connected the system to a test lung (QuickLung, Ingmar Medical, Pittsburgh, PA).

The linear actuator ( Figure 4A ) compresses a segment of 1/4\" OD, 1/8\" ID silicone tubing (hardness: Shore A45) by variable amounts to achieve flow control. At an inlet pressure of 15 psi, we found that a 3 mm actuation is sufficient for valve flow to transition from a completely closed state to a completely open state ( Figure 4B and 4C), with the completely open state allowing the maximum flow rate of 50 L/min. We also demonstrated both slow and fast actuation cycles of the valve ( Figure 4D and 4E, at actuation rates for fully-closed to fully-open cycles up to 5 Hz). We measured the valve's response time (time it takes for flow to reach 95% of its maximum value) to be 48\u02d88 ms ( Figure 4F ). Finally we tested the repeatability of the valve's proportional flow control by measuring the flow rate as a function of valve state ( Figure 4G ). The valve was found to be fairly repeatable, with the flow rate at a given valve state having a maximum variability of around 5% at the highest flow rates. Repeatability can be further improved by incorporating an encoder or a Hall effect limit switch.",
