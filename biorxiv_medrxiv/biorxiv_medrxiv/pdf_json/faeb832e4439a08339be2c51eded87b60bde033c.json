The analysis demonstrated a strong correlation (R 2 >0.7) between increment in air pollution and an increase in the risk of COVID-19 transmission within London boroughs. Particularly, strong correlations (R 2 >0.72) between the risk of COVID-19 15 fatality and NO2 and PM2.5 pollution concentrations were also found. Although this study assumed the same level of air pollution across a particular London borough, it demonstrates the possibility to employ air pollution as an indicator to rapidly identify the city's vulnerable regions. Such an approach can inform the decisions to suspend or reduce the operation of different public transport modes within a city. The methodology and learnings from the study can thus aid in public 20 transport's response to COVID-19 outbreak by adopting different levels of human-mobility reduction strategies based on the vulnerability of a given region.",

            "text": "The current outbreak of novel coronavirus COVID-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring it as a global pandemic [1] . Reported first within the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province of China in December 2019, the COVID-19 exhibits high human-to-human transmissibility and has spread rapidly across the world [2] . The human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 can occur from 30 individuals in the incubation stage or showing symptoms, and also from asymptomatic individuals who remain contagious [3] . The COVID-19 has been reported to transmit via the inhalation of exhaled respiratory droplets [4] that remain airborne for up to 3 hours [5] . The long-term exposure to air pollution has been reported to increase the risk of experiencing severe COVID-19 outcomes [6] . The extent to which COVID-19 induces respiratory stress in infected individuals may also be 35 influenced by underlying respiratory conditions [7] like acute respiratory inflammation, asthma and cardiorespiratory diseases [8] . The simultaneous exposure to air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM) and Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) alongside COVID-19 virus is expected to exacerbate the level of COVID-19 infection and risk of fatality [9, 10] . Moreover, the adsorption of the COVID-19 virus on PM could also contribute to long-range transmission of the virus [4] . For example, the 40 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) infected patients who lived in moderate air pollution levels were reported to be 84% more likely to die than those in regions with lower air pollution [11] . The aerosol and surface stability of the COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be similar to that of SARS-CoV-1 [5] . 5 Given the limited understanding of the epidemiology of COVID-19, social-distancing and humanmobility reduction measures can contribute greatly to tailoring public health interventions [12] . Consequently, countries across the world have enforced lockdowns and other coordinated efforts to reduce human-mobility [13, 14, 15, 16] . The UK's national framework for responding to a pandemic states that public transport should continue to operate normally during a pandemic, but 10 users should adopt good hygiene measures, and stagger journeys where possible [17] . Within the UK, London has recorded the highest COVID-19 related fatalities (i.e. 30.2% of UK's deaths as of 31 March 2020) [18] . On 18 March 2020, further to the UK government's advice, Transport for London (TfL) closed 40 out of 270 London Underground (LU) stations that do not serve as interchanges with other lines and announced a reduced service across its network [19] . This is also 15 because 30% of TfL's drivers, station staff, controllers and maintenance teams were not able to come to work, including those self-isolating or ill with COVID-19 [20] . The UK's current humanmobility reduction response reflects the need to maintain business continuity, near normal functioning of society and enable critical workers to make essential journeys [17, 21] . However, a statistically significant association exists between human-mobility through public transport and 20",

Both long-term and short-term exposure to air pollution has been associated with a variety of respiratory conditions [11] with children and elderly people being at most risk [31] . Our analysis shows that short-term exposure to air pollution (both NO2 and PM2.5) is significantly correlated with an increased risk of contracting and dying from 20 COVID-19. It was reported by [6] that long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increases the risk of COVID-19 deaths. Biologically, either long-term or short-term exposure to air pollutants such as PM2.5 and NO2 can compromise lung function and therefore increasing the risk of death from COVID-19 [7] . Also, the median level of airborne PM2.5 in LU during summer is often several times higher than other transport environments such as cycling (35 \u03bcg m \u22123 ), bus 25 (30.9 \u03bcg m \u22123 ), cars (23.7 \u03bcg m \u22123 ) [32, 26] . The greatest PM2.5 concentrations across the LU network was reported to be on the Victoria Line (around 16 times higher than roadside environment), followed by Northern, Bakerloo and Piccadily line [26] . The routine cleaning and maintenance of LU ranges from litter removal to preventing safety incidents rather than on reducing PM concentrations. Our study is in agreement with [22] who reported that there are higher 30 pandemic case rates for London boroughs with access to interchange stations, as individuals would interact with more people in comparison to through stations.",

We support the UK government's existing COVID-19 guidance [34] to exercise good hygiene 35 and to avoid unnecessary travel. While considering the evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted from an asymptomatic individual [3] , we do not support the current countermeasure of suspending LU operations on the stations that do not serve as interchanges. This is because of (i) the statistically significant risk of contracting ARI's on UK's public transport and higher pandemic case rates within London boroughs that have comparatively easier access to interchange stations 40 [21, 22] and, (ii) relatively higher air pollution levels in LU stations than ambient background locations or road side environment. Since isolating towns or even cities is not yet part of the UK government's action plan [34] , we recommend a vulnerability-based assessment of different boroughs in London and to accordingly suspend or reduce operations on LU stations within highly vulnerable regions.

Moving forward, human-mobility reduction measures provides the greatest benefit to COVID-19 mitigation [15, 14] as prevention is potentially costeffective than cure [22] or death. One of the most controversial debate in pandemic countermeasures is the potential benefit of human-mobility reduction and social-distancing attained by closure of public transport systems [21] . From a public policy perspective, there is a 15 need to achieve a trade-off between the potential public health benefits of closing public transport during a pandemic thereby delaying the community spread, against the socio-economic impacts of curtailing/reducing human mobility. Determining the vulnerability of regions/locations to COVID-19 might be helpful in achieving such trade-offs. To this end, this study demonstrates that the air pollution levels can serve as one of the indicators to assess a region's vulnerability to It has to be noted that the number of positive COVID-19 cases considered within this study are only those reported at the hospitals and does not include the growing number of people who are self-isolating due to COVID-19. While the individual risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19 is dependent on various factors (including age, underlying conditions, availability of health care, population density etc.), these results are informative for both scientists and decision-makers 25 in their efforts to reduce the transmission and impact of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak through appropriate human-mobility reduction strategies.",
