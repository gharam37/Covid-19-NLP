The identification of clinically approved drugs to be repurposed to combat 2019 CoV disease (COVID-19) would allow the rapid implementation of potentially lifesaving procedures. The major protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is considered a promising target, based on previous results from related CoVs with lopinavir (LPV), an HIV protease inhibitor. However, limited evidence exists for other clinically approved antiretroviral protease inhibitors, such as atazanavir (ATV). ATV is of high interest because of its bioavailability within the respiratory tract. Our results show that ATV could dock in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, with greater strength than LPV. ATV blocked Mpro activity. We confirmed that ATV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, alone or in combination with ritonavir (RTV) in Vero cells, human pulmonary epithelial cell line and primary monocytes, impairing virus-induced enhancement of IL-6 and",

Another critical residue, His41, was satisfactorily at a distance of 2.89 \u00c5 from bound LPV ( Figure 3A and 4A). While ATV did not interact with His41 or Cys145 ( Figure S2B and S3B), its position remained stable within the active site independent of conformational changes displayed by the enzyme ( Figure 3B and 4B). The steric occupation of the cleft in the enzymatic active site by ATV, which block the residues of the catalytic amino acids, can be explained by its stronger interactions with Mpro, compared to LPV, through multiple hydrogen bonds during stationary docking and molecular dynamics (Tables S1-S3).",

Molecular dynamics calculations were performed using NAMD 2.9 49 and Charmm27* force field 50 at pH 7, i.e., with deprotonated Glu and Asp, protonated Arg and Lys, and neutral His with a protonated N\u03b5 atom. This all-atom force field has been able to fold properly many soluble proteins [51] [52] [53] . The soluble proteins were centered in a cubic box of TIP3P water molecules 54 ; the box extended 1.2 nm outside the protein on its four lateral sides, and the appropriate numbers of Na+ and Cl-ions were added to ensure system neutralization. The electrostatic interactions were calculated using the Particle Mesh Ewald method and a cutoff of 1.2 nm 55 . The same cutoff of 1.2 nm was used for the Van der Waals interactions. The non-bonded pair lists were updated every 10 fs. In what follows, the analysis is based on MD simulation of 100 ns at 310 K.",

To assure that the proteinase profiles were not dependent on cellular enzymes, similar fractions of mock-infected cells were also comparison. The results from cysteine proteinase zymographic profiles in gelatinolytic gels reveled a cellular related band of approximately 70 kDa under both conditions (Figure 5, lanes Nil). This activity was blocked by the drug E-64, an epoxide that acts as an irreversible inhibitor of cysteine proteases (Figure 5, lanes E-64). In the infected cells, a region of activity was observed between 31 and 38 kDa that was not present in the mock fraction. This zone of molecular weight is consistent with expected size of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as was the inhibition of activity in this region by exposure of the gels to 10 \u03bcM of ATV, which did not affect the cellular cysteine proteinase at 70 kDa (Figure 5, lanes ATV). Further confirmation of the presence and activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in fractions from infected cells was obtained by treatment with RTV, which inhibited activity in the molecular range of 31-38 kDa without a change in the 70 kDa region (Figure 5, lanes RTV). These data are consistent with predictions from the molecular modeling and dynamic analyses that suggested that ATV could bind and target the enzymatic activity of the Mpro encode by the novel 2019 CoV.",

The existence of several ongoing clinical trials against COVID-19 reinforces the suggestion that drug repurposing represents the fastest approach to identify therapies to emerging infectious disease 8 . The WHO/UN, under the auspicious of the SOLIDARITY trial, have highlighted the most promising anti-CoV drugs, such as LPV/RTV with or without interferon-\u03b2, CQ and remdesivir 30 . Here, we provide preclinical evidence that another HIV protease inhibitor, ATV, can inhibit the activity of a critical protease of SARS-CoV-2, Mpro, and that this inhibition can extend to a disruption of viral replication as well as the release of cytokine storm-associated mediators associated with viral infection. The results suggest that the performance of ATV could be better than LPV and strongly support that inclusion of ATV-based therapies in clinical trials for COVID-19 either alone, in combination with RTV or both. Kaletra \u00ae is an LPV/RTV formulation from Abbot Laboratories that was approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2000 and was evaluated for use in the treatment during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 and again for MERS-CoV. Its continued evaluation with the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is a logical choice due to the conservation of the Mpro among these highly pathogenic viruses 31,32 . Nevertheless, information on the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to other antiviral protease inhibitors that have been approved since 2003 has been scarce.ATV was approved in 2003, and become a wider prescribed drug among HIVinfected individuals, than LPV, including for critically ill patients16 .

Based on our data, ATV and ATV/RTV are at least 10 times more potent. The ATV and ATV/RTV in vitro potencies are comparable to other small molecule inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2, such as remdesivir and CQ 20 . The improved potency of ATV, in comparison to LPV, may be at least in part due to its multiple hydrogen bond driven interactions within the Mpro active site. Other investigators have also recognized a wider range of interactions of ATV and Mpro compared to LPV 17,35 , although none provided functional evidence through phenotypic assays as presented here. Neither ATV nor LPV displayed any interactions with the catalytic dyad of Cys145 and His41 at the start of the molecular dynamic simulations. However, important interactions were observed at its end, such as LPV-His41 and ATV-Glu166.Glu166 is one of the residues that promotes the opeing of Mpro for its substrate to interact with the active site36,37 .LPV/RTV was the first line of defense for early patients with COVID-1931 .
