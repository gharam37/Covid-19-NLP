The current outbreak of illness due to coronavirus is reported in late December 2019. This new virus is very contagious and has quickly spread globally. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to 18 countries. On Feb 11, 2020, WHO named this \"COVID-19\". On March 11, as the number of COVID-19 cases has increased thirteen times apart from China with more than 118,000 cases in 114 countries and over 4,000 deaths, WHO declared this a pandemic.",

COVID-19 belongs to the family of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, where it begins with the initial level symptoms of the common cold to severe level of respiratory diseases causing difficulty in breathing, tiredness, fever, and dry cough [3] . Prasad et al. [4] observed that the identification of the virus can be improved by imaging using immunoelectron microscopy techniques [5] . Figure 1 shows the typical structure of COVID-19 virus, from the throat swab of the first Indian laboratory-confirmed case, captured using sample electron microscopy imaging. Till date, detailed morphology and ultrastructure of this virus remain incompletely understood, and there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, many ongoing clinical trials are evaluating potential treatments.",

The first stage begins with the cases reported for the people who travelled in already affected regions, whereas in the second stage, cases are reported locally among family, friends and others who came into contact with the person arriving from the affected regions. At this point the affected people are traceable. Later, the third stage makes the situation even worse as the transmission source becomes untraceable and spreads across the individuals who neither have any travel history nor came into contact with the affected person. This situation demands immediate lockdown across the nation to reduce the social contacts among individuals and control the rate of transmission. Figure 2 , presents the outbreak of COVID-19 across the nations with the high number of confirmed cases such as US, Italy, Spain, and China based on the WHO reports [3] , whereas figure 3 illustrates the rising characteristic of the number of confirmed, death, and recovered cases in these nations between the period January 22, 2020, to April 1, 2020, taken from Johns Hopkins live dashboard.

These countries are now in stage 4 of the transmission and facing more number of infections and deaths compared to China. In the case of China, it is observed that exponential growth of the confirmed cases reaches the saturation stage where the number of cases stopped growing. This follows from the fact that the number of susceptible people, which are exposed to virus, are dramatically reduced. This was made possible due to the reduced social contact among people by segregating the infected individuals in quarantine and a complete lockdown period was initiated by the Chinese government, thereby reducing the possibility of further spread.",

Machine learning and deep learning approaches are implemented using the python library \"sklearn\" and \"keras\" respectively, to predict the total number of confirmed, recovered, and death cases worldwide.

The standard DNN consists of a dense input layer with 128 neurons, three hidden dense layers with 256 neurons and output layer is consists of a single neuron whereas the RNN, consists of three stacks of LSTM layers having 64 neurons combined with 10% dropout to avoid the overfitting problem and final output layer with a single neuron. The mean squared error (MSE) is the most widely used objective function and root mean square error (RMSE) as a metric function for evaluating the regression models.

Table 1 indicates the RMSE score of the approaches computed against the available number of COVID-19 cases. It is also observed that training of LSTM model is heavily dependent on the deviation in the values, with the fact that larger the deviation more the time it takes to train. Hence, the number of cases were scaled using minmax scaler to fit the LSTM model and later the predicted cases were rescaled to the original range using invert minmax transform from \"sklearn\" python library. Among these approaches, the visual representation of the prediction from figure 6 and RMSE score as highlighted in table 1 confirms the PR approach as the best fit to follow the growing trend. ",

However, if the spread follows the predicted trend of the PR model then it would lead to huge loss of lives as it presents the exponential growth of the transmission worldwide. As observed from China, this growth of the COVID-19 can be reduced and quenched by reducing the number of susceptible individuals from the infected individuals. This is achievable by becoming unsocial and following the lockdown initiative with discipline. The study can further be extended to utilize other machine learning and deep learning models.",
