Two reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Results: A total of 4481 records were identified in our literature search. Six studies (five case reports and one case series) involving 58 mothers (16 mothers with COVID-19, 42 mothers with influenza) and their infants proved eligible. Five case reports showed that the viral nucleic acid tests for all thirteen collected samples of breast milk from mothers with COVID-19 were negative.",

But according to the five case reports (2, (18) (19) (20) (21) found by our review the nucleic acid test results for SARS-CoV-2 of breast milk samples from thirteen mothers with COVID-19 were all negative. No studies have reported the existence of virus nucleic acid in breast milk from mothers infected with SARS, MERS or influenza. Based on the considerations above, we believe that SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be transmissible via breast milk, but the quality of evidence remains low. As SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via close contact and droplets, transmission from mother to infant may be possible while breastfeeding. A case series indicated that influenza infected breastfeeding women who washed hands thoroughly did not transmit to their children during a one-month follow-up, regardless of if the mothers wore a mask or not (22) . A systematic review conducted in 2016 also revealed that wearing masks and hand hygiene can notably decrease the possibility of respiratory virus transmission (wearing masks: OR 0.32, 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.39; hand hygiene: OR 0.54, 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.67) (36) .
