            "text": "Objectives. SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome analysis has identified three large clades spreading worldwide, designated G, V and S. This study aims to analyze the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain/Europe. Methods. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic and Bayesian phylodynamic analyses have been performed to estimate the most probable temporal and geographic origin of different phylogenetic clusters and the diffusion pathways of SARS-CoV-2. Results. Phylogenetic analyses of the first 28 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences obtained from patients in Spain revealed that most of them are distributed in G and S clades (13 sequences in each) with the remaining two sequences branching in the V clade. Eleven of the Spanish viruses of the S clade and six of the G clade grouped in two different monophyletic clusters (S-Spain and G-Spain, respectively), with the S-Spain cluster also comprising 8 sequences from 6 other countries from Europe and the Americas. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was estimated in the city of Wuhan, China, around November 24, 2019, with a 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval from October 30-December 17, 2019. The origin of S-Spain and G-Spain clusters were estimated in Spain around February 14 and 18, 2020, respectively, with a possible ancestry of S-Spain in Shanghai. Conclusions. Multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions have been detected in Spain and at least two resulted in the emergence of locally transmitted clusters, with further dissemination of one of them to at least 6 other countries. These results highlight the extraordinary potential of SARS-CoV-2 for rapid and widespread geographic dissemination. author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is an ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] . The symptom onset of the first case of COVID-19 was reported in December 1, 2019 in the city of Wuhan (China) and the initial outbreak was related to the Huanan seafood market [2] [3] [4] . SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in all the countries of Europe, causing from hundreds to thousands deaths in almost all them [5] . According to GISAID database, three larger clades of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified so far, based on marker variants [6] . Thus, S clade is characterized by the presence of L84S in ORF8 and mostly comprises sequences from North America. V clade is characterized by G251V in ORF3 and mostly comprises Asian and European sequences. Finally, G clade is characterized by D614G in S protein and largely comprises sequences from Europe. Other sequences have not been included in any of these clades because they lack the mentioned markers [6] . The situation in Europe seems to be dominated by the three clades, although G clade is the largest one in GISAID so far. More than 5000 whole genome sequences of viruses collected in Europe have been already sequenced with high coverage, allowing the performance of phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses to better understand the transmission dynamics within the most affected countries in Europe.",

In Spain, the first two cases were reported during the following week (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) , the first one in La Gomera (Canary Islands) related to a known cluster in Germany and another one in Mallorca (Balearic Islands) from a British citizen who was initially in contact with a confirmed case in France returning from Singapore [8, 9] . The next 5 reported cases in Spain had all a travel history to Italy and were detected in Tenerife (Canary Islands), Catalonia, Castellon (Valencian Community) and Madrid before 26 February [10] . The following two days, Spain reported 18 new cases in Canary Islands, Catalonia, Andalusia and the Valencian Community and in the week of 1-7 March 2020, a total of 261 confirmed cases were reported in all the country [11] . The increasing number of whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Europe allows the development of phylodynamic studies to better understand these transmission dynamics of the virus in Spain and Europe and ideally to evaluate the proper functioning of surveillance systems.",

Then, another dataset was analyzed including only whole genome sequences from Europe and from Wuhan, the city of the outbreak onset, to study the viral transmission dynamics within Europe. The last dataset was retrieved with whole genome sequences from Spain and from the countries where the first positives cases were reported, i.e. France, Germany, Italy and Finland.

Duplicated sequences were discarded from all the datasets. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs of 100 million states sampling every 10,000 steps were computed. The convergence of MCMC chains was checked using Tracer v.1.7.1, ensuring that the effective sample size (ESS) values were greater than 200 for each parameter estimated [17] .

However, England was estimated as the origin of this cluster in spite of the fact that one representative sequence of the Bavarian cluster was included in the analysis (EPI-ISL-406962). This possible artifact could be explained by the low number of whole genome sequences available so far from Germany (n=8) compared with the sequences from England (n=58).

However, BF analyses did not support a direct transmission from Shanghai to Spain, suggesting that an ancestor of these viruses that are circulating in Spain was transmitted some time in the past in Shanghai but the introduction in Spain came from a different location. According to the same analysis, it is probable that the virus reached different European countries, including Spain, directly from Asia. The MRCA of the S-Spain clade was located in Spain and dated around February 14. This clade includes sequences from other 6 countries, suggesting its dissemination from Spain to USA, Netherlands, Chile, Brazil, Georgia and France. Epidemiologic investigations based on positive contact tracing have recently revealed that the first case detected in Europe was from a patient returning to France from Shanghai airport after a business trip in various cities, including Wuhan, in January 24 [23, 25] .",

Recently, one of the sequences from this cluster has been released (EPI-ISL-410486) and its analysis revealed that it branches outside of G, V, and S clades. None of the sequences from Spain included in the present study has this topological feature, since all of them branch in one of the major clades. However, the second case reported in Spain (from Mallorca, Balearic Islands) is related to this cluster, so there is a possibility that a virus with these characteristics is also circulating in Spain but has not been sequenced yet [8, 9] .",

            "text": "The main limitations of the present study are related to the fact that genomic sequences are being generated by diverse strategies following different steps that could affect the quality of the sequences. Different sample preparation techniques are being used, including overlapping amplicons, targeted capture where the viral RNA is enriched and metagenomic total RNA sequencing of rRNA depleted samples. The first two methods require less sequencing effort, but the possibility that some RNA molecules could be missed cannot be ruled out. On the contrary, the metagenomic approach is hypothesis-free, but implies a high number of sequencing reads. Another point to take into account is the sequencing strategies per se, since several approaches are being used, including Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing platforms, such as iSeq, MiSeq, NextSeq and Novaseq from Illumina, MinION and GridION from Nanopore and IonTorrent from ThermoFisher [6] . All these technologies also have their own biases. Finally, the informatics employed to analyze the data is the step where more diversity of options are being identified. For all these reasons, some of the genetic differences observed between samples could be attributable to the error rate of sequencing platforms, indicating that genomes may be more similar than observed. On the other hand, the use of a reference genome to align the reads instead of following a de novo approach could mask some real genetic differences. In this sense, initiatives in nf-core are trying to provide best practice pipelines for the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data in a peer-reviewed platform that includes some pipelines developed by the Bioinformatics Unit of the Instituto de Salud Carlos III [26] [27] [28] [29] . Moreover, due to the public health threat caused by SARS-CoV-2, more genomic and epidemiologic data are generated every day and the results obtained in the present study should be seen as an early report about the current situation at the end of March 2020.

The BF analysis revealed two important hubs of transmission for the V clade within Europe. The main one was England with probable diffusion to Netherlands (BF>100; PP=0.96), Italy (BF=36.46; PP=0.78) and Scotland (BF=21.76: PP=0.68).
