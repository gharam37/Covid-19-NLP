We fortuitously found that C3A was more susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV-27 OC43 infection than HepG2, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into 28 C3A cells. In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential 29 susceptibility of the two cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection, we found that ADAP2, GILT and 30 LY6E, three cellular proteins with known activity of interfering virus entry, expressed at 31 significantly higher levels in HepG2 cells. Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression 32 of LY6E, but not GILT or ADAP2, in HEK 293 cells inhibited the entry of HCoV-OC43. While 33 overexpression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of HCoV-34 OC43, knockdown of LY6E expression in HepG2 significantly increased its susceptibility to 35",

We also demonstrated recently that GILT suppresses the entry 99 of SARS-CoV, but not other human CoVs (38) . As reported herein, in our efforts to identify host 100 efficiency of HCoV-OC43pp infection in C3A cultures is approximately 50 folds higher than 124 that in HepG2 cultures. These results clearly indicate that the differential susceptibility is 125 attributed to the distinct ability of the two cell lines to support the infectious entry of 128 IFITM proteins modulate HCoV-OC43 infection of C3A and HepG2 cells in a similar 129 extent. We reported previously that IFITM proteins differentially modulate HCoV-OC43 entry 130 into target cells. While IFITM1 inhibits the virus entry, IFITM2 and IFITM3 enhance the cellular 131 entry of this virus (42). To investigate whether the differential expression of IFITM proteins in 132 the two cell lines is responsible for their difference in HCoV-OC43 infection efficiency, we 133 examined IFITM protein expression by Western blot assays and found the two hepatoma cell 134 lines expressed similar levels of IFITM1 and IFITM2/3 (Fig. 1B) . Because the C-terminal 135 variable regions of IFITM1 and IFITM3 control the inhibition and enhancement of HCoV-OC43 136 entry (42), respectively, we further compared the effects of IFITM1 and C-terminal region 137 exchanged IFITM proteins on the virus infection.

These results indicate that proper interaction of LY6E 182 with other viral/cellular components via the conserved residue L36 and localization in the 183 specific cell membrane microdomians are required for LY6E restriction of human CoV entry. 184 185 Activation of CoV entry by TMPRSS2 expression fails to evade LY6E restriction of CoV 186 entry. It was reported by others and us that expression of cell membrane associated serine 187 protease TMPRSS2 enhances SARS-CoV and SARS-like bat CoV entry (32-34). More 188 importantly, the TMPRSS2-enhanced entry can evade IFITM3 restriction (Mei Zheng, et al, 189 manuscript under review), presumably because the cellular protease activates the viral fusion at 190 cell surface or early endosomes where IFITM3 expression at a relatively lower levels and thus 191 the absence or presence of tetracycline (tet) for 24 h. The cells were then infected 195 with the indicated pseudotyped lentiviruses. As shown in Fig. 7A, in absence of tet to induce 196 LY6E, expression of TMPRSS2 significantly enhanced the infection of SARS-CoVpp, MERS-197 CoVpp and HCoV-229Epp, but not the infection of other human CoVpp and LASVpp. 198 Interestingly, LY6E significantly inhibited the infection of MERS-CoVpp and HCoV-229Epp in 199 the cells without or with ectopic expression of TMPRSS2. Moreover, LY6E failed to inhibit 200 SARS-CoVpp infection in the absence of TMPRSS2 expression, but significantly inhibited 201 SARS-CoVpp infection in the cells expressing TMPRSS2 (Fig. 7B). Therefore, unlikely IFITM3, 202 expression of TMPRSS2 cannot evade LY6E restriction of human CoV entry. Instead, LY6E 203 restriction of the entry of human CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV, is regulated by the expression 204 of cellular proteases that previously known to activate the fusion activity of viral spike proteins. 205 206 Amphotericin B treatment does not compromise LY6E restriction of human CoV entry. 207 Amphotericin B (AmphoB) is antifungal medicine that binds with ergosterol in fungal cell 208 membranes, forming pores that cause rapid leakage of monovalent ions and subsequent fungal 209 cell death. AmphoB can also bind to cholesterol in mammalian cell membrane, albeit at a lesser 210 affinity than to fungal ergosterol (49). The cholesterol-enriched plasma membrane microdomains 211 known as lipid rafts play important roles in the entry and egress of many enveloped viruses (50, 212 51). Particularly, AmphoB treatment had been shown to significantly compromise IFITM 213 restriction of IAV entry (52) and attenuate IFITM enhancement of HCoV-OC43 infection (42). 214",

            "text": "53). However, LY6E is not a typical antiviral effector protein. Instead, LY6E was reported to 229 promote the infection of enveloped RNA viruses from several viral families (48) and modulates 230 HIV-1 infection in a manner dependent on the level of CD4 expression in target cells (46, 47). 231 Our finding that LY6E restricts human CoV infection and characterization of its antiviral effects 232 shed new lights on the mode of LY6E action on virus entry in general. 233 First, either the enhancement or restriction of LY6E on virus entry depends on its GPI 234 anchor (Fig. 6) (46-48). GPI-anchored proteins are preferentially located in lipid rafts, the plasma 235 membrane microdomains enriched in glycosphingolipids and cholesterol as well as protein 236 receptors or ligands. Lipid rafts are considered to compartmentalize membrane processes by 237 interaction of protein receptors and their ligands/effectors to modulate membrane 238 functions, such as signal transduction, membrane fusion, vesicle budding and trafficking. Lipid 239 rafts also involve in the entry and egress of many viruses. For instance, both HIV-1 receptor 240 (CD4) and coreceptors are localized in lipid rafts. Yu and colleagues elegantly demonstrated 241 recently that LY6E enhances HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells and monocytic THP1-cells by 242 promoting the expansion of viral fusion pore induced by HIV-1 Env (47). Furthermore, LY6E 243 was found to be the receptor of mouse endogenous retroviral envelope Syncytin-A and 244 interaction of LY6E with Syncytin-A induces the syncytiotrophoblast fusion and placental 245 morphogenesis (55, 56). However, Mar and colleagues showed that LY6E enhances IAV 246 infection of cells by promoting a viral replication step after viral nucleocapsid escape from 247 endosomes, but before viral RNP nuclear translocation, i.e., most likely the uncoating of 248 nucleocapsids (48). Interestingly, the results presented in Fig. 4 indicate that LY6E significantly 249 enhanced the infection of IAVpp, suggesting that the LY6E enhancement of IAV infection is, at 250 least in part, through promoting the entry into target cells, possibly also by enhancing viral 251 fusion. Considering the broad inhibitory effects of LY6E on human CoVs and its fusogenic or 252 fusion-modulating activity, we speculate that LY6E might inhibit the membrane fusion triggered 253 by CoV spike proteins. However, the role of LY6E on endocytosis and endocytic vesicle 254 trafficking cannot be ruled out. These hypotheses are currently under investigation. 255",

            "text": "viral infection in Huh7.5 cells that do not have basal levels of IFITM protein 266 expression indicates that LY6E enhancement of RNA viral infection is most likely not through 267 modulating the function of IFITM proteins (42). This notion is further supported by the finding 268 that LY6E and Syncitin-A mediated syncytiotrophoblast fusion can be inhibited by IFITM 269 proteins (57, 58). 270 Third, studying the effects of LY6E on HIV-1 infection of CD4 low-expressing cells, 271 such as Jurkat T cells and primary monocyte-derived macrophages, revealed that HIV-1 entry 272 was inhibited by LY6E (46). This appears due to the LY6E-induced reduction of lipid raft-273 associated CD4 on the surface of these cells. It was demonstrated that LY6E can promote CD4 274 endocytosis and mobilize lipid raft-associated CD4 molecules to non-raft microdomains. Such a 275 receptor down-regulation significantly reduced HIV-1 binding and infection of CD4 low-276 expressing cells (macrophages), but did not significantly impact the binding of HIV-1 to CD4 277 high-expressing cells, which allows for LY6E to predominantly enhance HIV-1 infection of 278 CD4+ T lymphocytes by promotion of membrane fusion (46). It is, therefore, possible that LY6E 279 inhibition of human CoV infection is due to the down-regulation of lipid raft-associated CoV 280 receptors.

LY6E is ubiquitously expressed in many cell 173 types and functions in modulation of cell signal transduction (41). Recent studies revealed that 174 human LY6E promotes the entry of HIV (46, 47) and multiple enveloped RNA viruses from 175 several viral families (48). Moreover, the enhancement of RNA viral infection is a conserved 176 function of all the mammalian LY6E orthologs examined thus far. Particularly, substitution of 177 the evolutionally conserved residue L36 with alanine (A) completely abolished the viral 178 enhancement activity of LY6E (48). Interestingly, we found that L36A substitution also 179",

IFITMs modulate HCoV-OC43 infection of HepG2 and C3A cells in a similar 700 extent and via the same mechanism. HepG2 and C3A were stably transduced with a control 701 retroviral vector (pQCXIP) or a retroviral vector expressing a N-terminally flag tagged IFITM1-702 EX2 or IFITM3-EX2. The resulting cell lines were infected with HCoV-OC43 at 0.1 MOI. (A) 703Cells were fixed at 24 hpi and virally infected cells were visualized by IF staining of HCoV-704 .
