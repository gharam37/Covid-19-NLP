Among the various genetic variations, 51 insertion of Furin protease cleavage site in the spike glycoprotein (aa682 -aa689) is 52 strikingly novel in SARS-CoV-2 (4, 8) and has not been found in other related coronaviruses 53 (SARS-CoV-1, Bat-CoV, Pangolin) (MERS contain pseudo binding site) (Fig. S1A). Furin 54 protease belongs to the family of calcium (Ca2+)-dependent proprotein/prohormone 55 convertase (PCs) which is ubiquitously expressed in humans but its levels are elevated lung 56 cystic fibrosis (9). Furin protease also cycles from trans-Golgi network (TGN) to cell 57 membrane (virus attaches) and endosomes (virus translocate in endosomes). Interestingly, 58Furin and other related proteases are highly specific and known for cleaving different viral 59 (Influenza, HIV) envelope glycoproteins, thereby enhancing viral fusion with the host cell 60 membrane (10). Furthermore, Furin preferentially recognizes the motif R-X-K/R-R and 61 cleaves the peptide in the presence of Ca2+, which is physiologically connected to different 62 viral infections(10, 11). However, about SARS-CoV-2, it is elusive that how Furin could 63 bind and act on the viral spike glycoprotein. Hence to understand the interaction mode and 64 mechanism of Furin action over the spike glycoprotein warrants further structural",

Furthermore, the binding of Furin protease creates a large 93 burred interface of ~1,100\u00c52 (~368\u00c52/Furin) between the proteins, as calculated from the 94 PISA server (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa/). This suggests a bonafide and tight 95 interaction of Furin protease over the spike glycoprotein and Furin. The depth, shape and 96 charge of Furin protease are well known and it has canyon-like crevice and its active site 97 pocket is conserved in many species and the catalytic or substrate-binding pocket is made of 98 key amino acid residues R185, M189, D191, N192, R193, E229, V231, D233, D259, K261, 99",

Furthermore, the entire cleavage loop of viral spike protein fits into the 110 canyon-like substrate-binding pocket of Furin protease. It is quite interesting to notice that 111 none of the previously known coronaviruses had this novel Furin protease cleavage site in the 112 spike glycoprotein, which accentuates the novelty and uniqueness of SARS-CoV-2. In 113 addition, previous reports on the glycosylation of spike glycoprotein show that Furin 114 cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is not targeted by the glycosylation, 115hence this cleavage loop is completely solvent-exposed (4). This further corroborates the 116 potential attack of Furin protease over the S1/S2 cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike 117 glycoprotein. Based on the Furin binding mode and structural interaction, we propose the 118 following supposition. The binding and cleaving (priming) the spike glycoprotein at S1/S2 119 region by Furin protease might cut the spike glycoprotein into N-terminal S1 domain 120 involved in host cell recognition and C-terminal S2 membrane-anchored domain involved in 121 host cell penetration and entry, thus making the SARS-CoV-2 highly virulent. In support of 122 this supposition, it is evident in infectious bronchitis virus that presence of Furin cleavage site 123 has pronounced virulence suggesting Furin cleavage increase the virulence (13this enzyme cleavage action and separation of N-and C-terminal domain of 128",
