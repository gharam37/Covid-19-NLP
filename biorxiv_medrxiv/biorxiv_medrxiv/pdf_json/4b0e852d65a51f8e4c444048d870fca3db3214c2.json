As of 5 April, more than 1 million infections and 60 thousands of deaths have been reported. 1 Several agents or drugs including, remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, lopinavir-ritonavir (used in combination) and chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), have been highlighted based on the promising in-vitro results and therapeutic experiences from another two coronavirus diseases including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) 2 . However, none of these promising results has yet been translated into clinical benefits of patients with COVID-19, including lopinavir-ritonavir, reported from the most recently failed trial. 3 Another \"wonder drug\", CQ and its hydroxy-analogue HCQ, are glaring on the list of COVID-19 therapy, due to potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 from in-vitro studies, 4, 5 and promising results from news reports of some ongoing trials. 6 Despite their unclear benefits, CQ and HCQ are both recommended for off-label use in the treatment of COVID-19 by the Chinese National guideline 7 and recently authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency uses. 8 HCQ was also recently recommended by the American president Donald Trump.",

Although there is no data of CQ/HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 from animal studies, data from a mice study suggested limited efficacy of CQ in inhibiting SARS-CoV replication. 14 Promising anti-viral results of HCQ from the recent trial should be interpreted with caution due to its limited sample size and lack of randomization design.

We were unable to validate this result due to the limited number of patients using azithromycin (N=2). In contrast to their excellent effects, our results did not support the clinical use of HCQ to suppress viral replication. One might argue that there was a median 16-day delay of HCQ treatment from symptoms onset in our study, which is longer than the time window of effective treatment of virus-related respiratory disease, like influenza. 16 However, in the subgroup of patients who received HCQ within 7-day of illness onset, no additional virus negative conversion rate was observed beyond SOC in our trial. It is challenging to conduct a trial in hospitalized patients within 48-h of illness onset due to an estimated 12.5 day delay from illness onset to hospital admission. 17 Future trials should consider enrolling patients at early-stage from the outpatient clinic. One might also argue that the current SOC included antivirals that were sources of confounding effects, although none of them has yet been proven efficacy in treating COVID-19.",

Of note, the promising drug, lopinavir-ritonavir which is an inhibitor of HIV protease, was recently demonstrated ineffective in lowering virus load of SARS-CoV-2. 3 Moreover, the specimens collected in our trial for virus RNA determination was mostly from the upper respiratory tract, which introduced false-negative results. 18 Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, the best specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2 was not well collected since the majority of our patients were mild/moderate cases without need for a bronchoscopy.

Such abilities and benefits were observed from HCQ in our current trial, showing that patients with SOC plus HCQ had a significantly greater reduction of CRP level and a moderate elevation of blood lymphocyte count at the last assessment comparing to patients with SOC only. These effects were observed after 5-day of HCQ treatment and maintained until the withdraw of HCQ. These encouraging results suggested clinical benefits of adding HCQ into the current standard management to limit inflammatory response, which is the key to prevent systemic inflammation and subsequent multiple organ failure and death.

Evidence for increased rate of adverse gastrointestinal events in a high dose of HCQ 27 was observed in our trial, particularly an increased burden of diarrhea. Events of cardiac arrhythmia, e.g., prolonged QT interval 28 was not observed in our trial, possibly due to the relatively mild/moderate patients investigated or the short-term period of follow-up.

The administration of HCQ with a loading dose of 1, 200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintained dose of 800 mg daily for remaining days (total treatment duration: 2 weeks or 3 weeks for mild/moderate or severe patients, respectively) was clearly associated with a greater decline of CRP, recovery of lymphopenia and a higher rate of symptoms alleviation and did not result in apparent safety concerns in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Shown is the bar chart for the absolute changes of CRP and blood lymphocyte count at last assessment comparing to baseline values in patients with SOC with and without HCQ. Data were expressed as mean with standard error of mean. The declined value of CRP from baseline by last assessment was significantly greater in SOC plus HCQ group than in the SOC group (change, -6.986 versus -2.723 milligram/liter, P=0.045). The elevation of blood lymphocyte count at last assessment from baseline was greater in SOC plus HCQ group than that in the SOC group (change, 0.062 versus 0.008 \u00d7 10 9 /liter), but without statistical significance (P=0.547).

An evident efficacy of HCQ on the alleviation of symptoms was demonstrated (Hazard ratio, 8.83, 95%CI, 1.09 to 71.3) in the subgroup of patients without receiving antiviral treatment in the post-hoc analysis. This was further supported by a significantly greater reduction of CRP (6.986 in SOC plus HCQ versus 2.723 in SOC, milligram/liter, P=0.045) conferred by the addition of HCQ, which also led to more rapid recovery of lymphopenia, albeit no statistical significance.",

The effects of HCQ in causing increased levels of digitoxin and metoprolol 22 would be particularly relevant in severe COVID-19 patients and therefore would require close monitoring. Numerous challenges were encountered in the performance of this multi-center randomized controlled trial, which was initiated during the most challenging time of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Although a major strength of our trial was its randomized design, an open-label, as opposed to double-blind design, would introduce biased investigator-determined assessments. The knowledge on the association of clinical or virologic characteristics to disease course at the time of our trial design was largely limited. Selecting the virus negative conversion as the primary end-point might not be the most appropriate outcome for investigating the treatment efficacy of HCQ. The shortened time to alleviation of symptoms and rapid normalization elevated CRP and recovery of lymphocytopenia in patients who received HCQ observed in our trial suggested more potential of this drug in controlling acute inflammation and might be useful for preventing disease progression. Another difficulty is to ensure the fidelity to the protocol by investigators under highly challenging circumstances at the front lines in the COVID-19 treatment centers.
