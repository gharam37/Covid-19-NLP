Serologic methods can more accurately estimate the disease burden by detecting infections missed by the limited testing performed to date. Here, we describe the validation of a coronavirus antigen microarray containing immunologically significant antigens from SARS-CoV-2, in addition to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, common human coronavirus strains, and other common respiratory viruses. A comparison of antibody profiles detected on the array from control sera collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic versus convalescent blood specimens from virologically confirmed COVID-19 cases demonstrates complete discrimination of these two groups. This array can be used as a diagnostic tool, as an epidemiologic tool to more accurately estimate the disease burden of COVID-19, and as a research tool to correlate antibody responses with clinical outcomes.",

            "text": "Background COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a worldwide pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality estimates from 1-4% of confirmed cases 1 . The current case definition for confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on PCR-positive pharyngeal or respiratory specimens, with testing largely determined by presence of fever or respiratory symptoms in an individual at high epidemiologic risk. However, this case definition likely underestimates true prevalence, as individuals who develop subclinical infection that does not produce fever or respiratory symptoms are unlikely to be tested, and testing by PCR of pharyngeal or respiratory specimens is only around 60-80% sensitive depending on sampling location and technique and the patient's viral load 2 . Widespread testing within the United States is also severely limited by the lack of available testing kits and testing capacity limitations of available public and private laboratories. Therefore, the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely much higher than currently reported case numbers would indicate. Serology can play an important role in defining the true prevalence of COVID-19, particularly for subclinical infection 2 . Early studies of serology demonstrate high sensitivity to detect confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with antibodies to virus detected approximately 1 to 2 weeks after symptom onset 3 . Unlike PCR positivity, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are detectable throughout the disease course and persist indefinitely 4 . Multiple serologic tests have been developed for COVID-19 5 including a recently FDA-approved lateral flow assay. However, these tests are limited to detection of antibodies against one or two antigens, and cross-reactivity with antibodies to other human coronaviruses that are present in all adults 6 is currently unknown. Prior use of serology for detection of emerging coronaviruses focused on antibodies against the spike (S) protein, particularly the S1 domain, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein 7 . However, the optimal set of antigens to detect strain-specific coronavirus antibodies remains unknown. Protein microarray technology can be used to detect antibodies of multiple isotypes against hundreds of antigens in a high throughput manner 8, 9 so is well suited to serologic surveillance studies. This technology, which has previously been applied to other emerging coronaviruses 10 , is based on detection of binding antibodies, which are wellcorrelated with neutralizing antibodies 11 but do not require viral culture in biosafety level 3 facilities. Recently, our group developed a coronavirus antigen microarray (CoVAM) that includes antigens from SARS-CoV-2 and tested it on human sera collected prior to the pandemic to demonstrate low cross-reactivity with antibodies from human coronaviruses that cause the common cold, particularly for the S1 domain 2 . Here, we further validate this methodology using convalescent blood specimens from COVID-19 cases confirmed by positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR.",

Two sera and plasma samples were obtained from acute COVID-19 patients from the Oregon Health Sciences University Hospital (OHSU), Portland, OR. These were sourced from discarded clinical laboratory specimens exempted from informed consent and IRB approval under condition of patient anonymity. Four plasma samples were obtained from outpatients of the University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland. These patients were screened in accordance with Swiss regulations on blood donation and approved as plasma donors according to the Blood Transfusion Service of the Swiss Red Cross with informed consent. These donors were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR tests. At time of plasma donation, each had two negative nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 PCR-tests and negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests in blood, and they were qualified as plasma donors. Plasma was collected from these convalescent donors at the Regional Blood Transfusion Service of the Swiss Red Cross in accordance with national regulations. One convalescent plasma was isolated from a large-volume apheresis collection following standard protocol from a documented recovered COVID-19 blood donor who was more than 28 days post symptomatic. The negative control sera used in this study were collected between November 2018 and May 2019 for a larger study where residents of a college resident community in the Eastern United States were monitored prospectively to identify acute respiratory infection (ARI) cases using questionnaires and RT-qPCR, so as to characterize contagious phenotypes including social connections, built environment, and immunologic phenotypes 12 .

            "text": "This study reveals several insights into the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The antibody profiles of na\u00efve individuals include high IgG reactivity to common cold coronaviruses with low-level cross-reactivity with S2 domains from SARS-CoV-2 and other epidemic coronaviruses, which is not surprising given the high degree of sequence homology and previously observed serologic cross-reactivity 15 between S2 domains of betacoronaviruses, a group that includes SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS, and common cold coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43. However, na\u00efve individuals do not show crossreactivity to other SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Even for the nucleocapsid protein, which also has high sequence homology between betacoronaviruses, cross-reactivity is only seen between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and not with MERS-CoV or common cold coronaviruses. In addition, the quantitative difference between high antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 S2 in the positive group and low-level antibody cross-reactivity in the negative group is large enough that these antigens still discriminate these groups with high significance. This study also informs antigen selection and design for population surveillance and clinical diagnostic assays and vaccine development. The observation that na\u00efve individuals with antibodies to common cold coronaviruses do not show cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein dispels concerns that the high sequence homology of this protein across betacoronaviruses would impair its performance as a diagnostic or vaccine antigen. The low-level antibody cross-reactivity of na\u00efve individuals for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein containing S2 domain may not preclude its use as a diagnostic antigen given large quantitative difference in antibody reactivity between positive and negative groups, but this cross-reactivity may influence response to vaccination with spike protein antigens containing the S2 domain. The coronavirus antigen microarray can be useful both as an epidemiologic tool and as a research tool. The high throughput detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody profiles that reliably distinguish COVID-19 cases from negative controls can be applied to large-scale population surveillance studies for a more accurate estimation of the true prevalence of disease than can be achieved with symptom-based PCR testing. In addition, detection of these antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma donations can provide validation prior to clinical use for passive immunization. The variation in the SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles among acute and convalescent donors suggests that epitope characterization of convalescent donor plasma will be informative for evaluation of passive immune therapy efficacy in COVID-19 patients. The central role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 16 can be more closely studied by analyzing both strain-specific and cross-reactive antibody responses, particularly to test hypotheses regarding antibody-dependent enhancement with critical implications for vaccine development 17 .",
