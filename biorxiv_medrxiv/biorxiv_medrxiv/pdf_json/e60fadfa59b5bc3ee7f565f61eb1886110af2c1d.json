Therefore, this study utilized the non-linear least squares method to estimate the impact of weather temperatures and median age on COVID-19 cases per million in thirty-nine countries divided into two groups. The first group composed of twenty-four countries that announced the first COVID-19 case in January 2020, while the second group contains fifteen countries that witnessed the pandemic for the first time in February of the same year. The study revealed some major findings, which are: COVID-19 cases per million were not significantly affected by weather temperature or the median age in \"January-group\" countries (after 72.67 days on average), while COVID-19 cases per million increased significantly by decreasing temperatures, and increasing the median age in case of \"February-group\" countries (after an average of 44.80 days). This means that weather temperature and median age may influence the transmission rates of COVID-19 in its early stages, while weather temperature or median age no longer have effects in the advanced stages of the pandemic.",

This pandemic, which has spread to most countries of the world due its extremely high transmission rate of 2-2.5 (WHO, 2020-1) , not only more targets the elder age categories, but it may also target specific places in the world, but rather specific areas in the country itself.",

(Gundy & Gebra, 2009 ) have demonstrated that the activity of SARS virus in water is highly dependent on temperature, as the virus is rapidly inactivated in water at a temperature of 23\u00b0C for ten days compared to more than 100 days at a temperature of 4\u00b0C. In 2010 (Casanova, Jeon, Rutala, Weber, & Sobsy, 2010) recorded that SARS Cov was inactivated faster at 20\u00b0C compared to 4\u00b0C at all levels of relative humidity (above 20%), and that virus was inactivated faster at 40\u00b0C than 20\u00b0C. (Chan, Peiris, Poon, & Seto, 2011) explained in 2011 that SARS Cov virus retain its vitality for more than five days on surfaces at a temperature of 22-25\u00b0C and relative humidity between 40-50 %, But the virus soon loses its vitality at higher temperatures and relative humidity (such as 38\u00b0C, and relative humidity above 95%).",

For instance, California, the USA's economic capital, was the most affected in the far northeast. Likewise, the province of Lampodria in northern Italy, the responsible for 40% of industrial production 2 was the most effected Italian area. Furthermore, COVID-19 has swept through Madrid, the Spanish capital, and the most important financial and economic center 3 . As well, the pandemic was concentrated in Wuhan, the transportation and industry hub in central China 4 , and the capital of China's Hubei Province, the source of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In Germany, the province of Bavaria, the second largest German province in terms of population, the producer of 18% of the gross German domestic product 5 was the most affected.
