Analysis of confirmed COVID-19 patients' hospital length of stay in Sichuan can be informative to decision-making in other regions of the world. Design A retrospective cross-sectional study. Data and Method Data from confirmed COVID-19 cases in Sichuan Province were obtained from the National Notifiable Diseases Reporting System (NNDRS) and field survey. We collected information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical characteristics, and the length of hospital stay for confirmed patients. We conducted an exploratory analysis using adjusted multivariate cox-proportional models. Participants A total of 538 confirmed patients of COVID-19 infection in Sichuan Province , 538 human cases of COVID-19 infection were laboratory-confirmed, and were hospitalized for treatment. Among these, 271 (50%) were 45 years of age or above, 285 (53%) were male, 450 (84%) were considered as having mild symptoms. The median hospital length of stay was 19 days (interquartile range (IQR): 14-23, Range: 3-41). Adjusted multivariate analysis showed that longer hospital length of stay was associated with factors aged 45 and over (HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.60-0.91), those admitted to provincial hospital (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.54-0.99), and those with serious illness (HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.48-0.90); living in areas with more than 5.5 healthcare workers per 1000 population (HR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05-1.65) was associated with shorter hospital length of stay. There was no gender difference. Conclusions Preparation control measures of COVID-19 should involve the allocation of sufficient medical resources, especially in areas with older vulnerable populations and in areas that lack basic medical resources.",

Only three patients died. 271 (50%) of the 538 individuals who had to be admitted to hospital were aged at least 45 years, and 285 (53%) were male, 450 (84%) were classified as having mild illness. Among the discharged patients, 150 (41%) took at least 5 days from illness onset to diagnosis, 301 (83%) were admitted to hospitals below the provincial level, and 190 (52%) lived in areas with a medical resource density of more than 5.5 health service personnel per 1000 residents ( Table 1 ). The median length of stay for all confirmed inpatients was 19 days (interquartile range (IQR): 14-23, range: 3-41), while it was 21 days (IQR: 14-24, range: 3-41) for those aged 45 years and above, 18 days (IQR: 13-22, range: 3-41) for people under 45 years old, 19 days (IQR: 14-24, range: 3-41 for male; IQR: 14-23, range: 3-37 for female) for both men and women, 18 days (IQR: 13-24, range: 3-41) for patients with at least a 5-day interval from illness onset to visit hospital, 19 days (IQR: 14-23, range: 3-41) for patients who were admitted to hospitals below the provincial level, 18 days (IQR: 12-23, range: 3-41) for patients living in areas with a medical resource density greater than 5.5 healthcare workers per 1000 population, and 19 days (IQR: 14-23, range: 3-39) for mild cases (Table 1 and Figure 1A ).",

On March 11, 2020, WHO characterized COVID-19 as pandemic. 13 14 Novel coronavirus pneumonia has become a major public health event because of its extremely rapid transmission speed, large-scale spread and the extreme utilization of medical resources by numerous patients. Therefore, according to the local demographics and the current status of medical resources, it is extremely important to prepare for risk prevention and control in advance. We modeled demographic characteristics, treatment behaviors, clinical characteristics and local medical resources of hospitalized confirmed patients in order to inform prospective risk assessment for on different areas. Based on the hospitalization data of confirmed patients in Sichuan Province, we found that patients at least 45 years, those with serious illness, those living in areas with fewer healthcare workers per 1,000 people, and those admitted to higher levels of hospitalization had longer lengths of hospitalization, while gender, time interval from onset to visit the hospital had no effect on the length of the hospital stay. That is to say, areas with more vulnerable older populations may require more medical resource allocations to cope with longer hospital stays. In contrast, whether patients see a doctor in time does not seem to affect hospitalization periods, as the results of single factor and multi-factor survival analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the length of stay between the two groups whose time interval from onset to diagnosis is within 5 days and more than 5 day.",

The overall mortality rate was estimated to be 2.3%. 18 19 Although the mortality rate of COVID-19 was lower than that of SARS (10%) and MERS (34%), the total number deaths of COVID-19 globally exceeded SARS and MERS.

For example, many patients with mild illness may occupy many medical resources. In Sichuan Province, 78% (419 / 538) of the patients were admitted to non-provincial hospitals. Single factor analysis showed that different levels of hospitals had no effect on the length of inpatient treatment. After controlling the covariates such as patient age, clinical severity and regional medical service density, we found that the hospital level had a weak association to the length of stay, which was mainly attributed to the clinical severity of patients. And patients in areas with more than 5.5 health servicers per 1,000 population had shorter hospital stays. Massonnaud et al. assessed COVID-19 impact on healthcare resources for each French metropolitan region based on the average length of stay in hospitals of 15 days, and showed that even in the best case scenario, the French healthcare system will very soon be overwhelmed 23 This paper shows the necessity of establishing a multi-level medical system and strengthening primary medical care, which can reduce the pressure of high-level hospitals in case of public health emergencies. In recent years, China has been strengthening the construction of lower-level medical systems and the monitoring of major diseases and health hazards, which deserve further implementation. 24 In addition, this study pointed out that the interval length of time from symptoms to doctor's visit did not affect the length of stay in hospitals, while some patients may mistakenly regard the COVID-19 infection as influenza, but COVID-19 is more infectious and pathogenic, 25 and the length of stay in hospital is longer, while the mean length of stay for the treatment of influenza was less than a week. 26 We suggest that in areas with insufficient medical resources and shortage of inpatient beds, patients under 45 years old with mild illness could choose to be treated at home with quarantine under the guidance of doctors, which may avoid cross infection and crowding of medical resources, under the circumstances of access to medical security at home, and timely communication between doctors and patients. While promoting quarantine, best-practices should be considered, such as placing patients in an isolated single room with good ventilation and away from visitors. [27] [28] [29] ",
