Examples of the numerous projects include outbreak.info (2) , VODAN around FAIR data (3) , CORD-19-on-FHIR (4) and #covidpathways (5) . Many research papers and preprints get published every week and many call for more Open Science (6) .

In contrast to legacy databases, where data models follow a relational data schema of connected tables, Wikidata ( https://wikidata.org/ ) uses statements to store facts (see Figure 1 ) (10) (11) (12) (13) . This model of statements aligns well with the RDF triple model of the semantic web and the content of Wikidata is also serialized as Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples (14, 15) , acting as stepping stone for data resources to the semantic web. Through its SPARQL endpoint other nodes in the semantic web, using either mappings between these resources or through federated SPARQL queries (16) . Automated editing of Wikidata simplifies a lot of things, however, the quality control of that process must be monitored carefully. This requires a clear data schema that allows the various resources to be linked with additional provenance. This schema describes the key concepts required for the integrations of the resources we are interested in: NCBI Taxonomy (17) , NCBI Gene (18) , UniProt (19) , the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (20) , WikiPathways (21) , and PubMed. Therefore , the key elements for   which we need a model include viruses, virus strains, virus genes, and virus proteins. The first two provide the link to taxonomies, the models for genes and proteins link to UniProt, PDB, and WikiPathways. These key concepts are also required to annotate research output such as journal articles and datasets related to these topics. Wikidata calls such keywords 'main subjects'. The introduction of this model and the actual SARS-CoV-2 genes and proteins in Wikidata enables the integration of these resources.",

Input to the workflow is the NCBI Taxonomy identifier of a virus under scrutiny. ( e.g. 2697049 for SARS-CoV-2). The taxon annotations are extracted from NCBI EUtils. The gene and gene product annotations are extracted from mygene.info and the protein annotations are extracted from UniProt using the SPARQL endpoint at ( https://sparql.uniprot.org/ ). Genomic information from seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) was obtained from literature including the NCBI Taxonomy identifiers. For six virus strains a reference genome was available and was used to populate Wikidata. For SARS-CoV-1, the NCBI Taxonomy identifier referred to various strains, though no reference strain was available. To overcome this issue, the species taxon for SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) was used instead, following the practices of NCBI Genes and UniProt.",

Indeed, many articles discuss the genetics, homology of genes and proteins across viruses, or the molecular aspects of how these proteins are created and how they interfere with the biology of the human cell. The biological pathways show these processes, but ultimately the knowledge comes from literature. Wikidata allows us to link literature to specific virus proteins and genes, depending on what the article describes. For this it uses the 'main subject' property ( P921 ). We manually annotated literature with the Wikidata items for specific proteins and genes. We developed two SPARQL queries to count the number of links between genes ( https://w.wiki/Lsp ) and proteins ( https://w.wiki/Lsq ) and the articles that discuss them. Scholia takes advantage of the 'main subject' annotation, allowing the creation of \"topic\" pages for each protein. For example, Figure 8 shows the topic page of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Wikidata provides a solution. It is part of the semantic web, taking advantage of its reification of the Wikidata items as RDF. Data in Wikidata itself is frequently, often almost instantaneously, synchronised with the RDF resource and available through its SPARQL endpoint ( http://query.wikidata.org ). The modelling process turns out to be an important aspect of this protocol. Wikidata contains numerous entity classes as entities and more than 7000 properties which are ready for (re-)use. However, that also means that one is easily lost. The ShEx schema have helped us develop a clear model, as a social contract between the authors of this paper, as well as documentation for future users.",

The Wikidataintegrator library does have functionality to prevent the creation of duplicates by comparing properties, based on used database identifiers. However, if two items have been created using different identifiers, these cannot be easily identified. Close inspection of examples, such as the one in Figure 9 , showed that the duplicates were created because there was a lack of overlap between the data to be added and the existing item. The UniProt identifier did not yet resolve, because it was manually extracted from information in a March 27 pre-release (see ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/pre_release/ ). The Pfam identifier pointed to a page that did not contain mappings to other identifiers.

Numerous annotations are scattered across different sources without any high-level of integration, thereby reducing the reusability of knowledge from different sources. Integration of the annotations from these resources is a complex and time consuming task. Each resource uses different ways to access the data from a user and machine perspective. Making use of these protocols programmatically to access and retrieve data of interest, requires the knowledge of various technologies and procedures to extract the information of interest.",

This manuscript presented a protocol to link information from disparate resources, including NCBI Taxonomy, NCBI Gene, UniProt, PubMed, and WikiPathways. Using the existing Wikidata infrastructure, we developed semantic schemas for virus strains, genes, and proteins, bots written in Python to add knowledge on genes and proteins of the seven human coronaviruses and linked them to biological pathways in WikiPathways and to primary literature, visualized in Scholia. We were able to do so in the period of two weeks, using an ad-hoc formed team from existing collaborations, taking advantage of the open nature of the components involved..
