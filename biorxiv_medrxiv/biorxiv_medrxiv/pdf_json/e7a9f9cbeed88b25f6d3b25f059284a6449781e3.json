            "text": "An opportunity exists in exploring epidemic modeling as a novel way to determine physiological and demic parameters for genetic association studies on a population/environmental (quasi) epidemiological study level. First, the spread of SARS-COV-2 has produced population specific lineages; second, epidemic spread model parameters are tied directly to these physiological and demic rates (e. g. incubation time, recovery time, transmission rate); and third, these parameters may serve as novel phenotypes to associate with region-specific genetic mutations as well as demic characteristics (e. g. age structure, cultural observance of personal space, crowdedness). Therefore, we sought to understand whether the parameters of epidemic models could be determined from the trajectory of infections, recovery, and hospitalizations prior to peak, and also to evaluate the quality and comparability of data between jurisdictions reporting their statistics necessary for the analysis of model parameters across populations. We found that, analytically, the pre-peak growth of an epidemic is limited by a subset of the model variates, and that the rate limiting variables are dominated by the expanding eigenmode of their equations. The variates quickly converge to the ratio of eigenvector components of the positive growth rate, which determines the doubling time. There are 9 parameters and 4 independent components in the eigenmode, leaving 5 undetermined parameters. Those parameters can be strikingly population dependent, and can have significant impact on estimates of hospital loads downstream. Without a sound framework, measurements of infection rates and other parameters are highly corrupted by uneven testing rates to uneven counting and reporting of relevant values. From the standpoint of phenotype parameters, this means that structured experiments must be performed to estimate these parameters in order to perform genetic association studies, or to construct viable models that accurately predict critical quantities such as hospitalization loads.",

At the same time, phylogenetic analysis shows geographic specificity 5, 6 , indicating that geographic regions may show specific exposure to distinctive SNP combinations, or viral haplotypes, in SARS-COV-2. This specificity suggests a benefit to exploring relationships between duration of the prodromic phase, proportions of asymptomatic cases 7 , proportions of severe cases, rates of recovery, among other infection attributes 8 , that define temporal progression of compartmental epidemic models, starting with SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) models 9 . Beside host and viral genetic impacts, other aspects driving SARS-COV-2 rates are population specific and demic, such as the impact of age on both asymptomatic and mild cases, as well as the proportion of severe and critical cases. Other aspects include normal social distance, and how effectively social-distancing rules have been followed. Hospital survival may also reflect impacts of some genetic susceptibility, presence of comorbidities (Hypertension, Diabetes, Asthma, lung disease, obesity and others yet to be identified) as well as the level of stress on the region's medical facilities and medical staff.",

For example, from time of infection to the time the person can transmit disease has a time distribution, that, for enough people in the compartment, will tend to center on an average by the central limit theorem for large enough samples drawn from any given distribution. There is evidence that COVID-19 presents symptomatic cases and asymptomatic cases, with asymptomatic cases [10] [11] [12] less likely to be identified and isolated [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . There is an incubation period after infection that lasts until the incubating individuals become infectious. There has been some early estimates based on confirmed cases 13, 18 with more evidence of pre-symptomatic transmission being noted 19, 20 yielding faster incubation. Incubation partly accounts for the observed lag when social distancing or other viral spread prevention policies are imposed. For the most part, infections appear to be transmittable prior to overt symptoms, allowing for a pre-symptomatic period that may convert to symptomatic. At the same time, some of those asymptomatic people remain asymptomatic until they are non-contagious 11 . Patients may still be infectious for several days after symptomatic recovery. Symptomatic patients likely to be hospitalized are hospitalized more quickly than non-hospitalized patients recover. Hospitalized patients in ICU or required immediate ventilation tend to experience a longer time to recovery than nonhospitalized patients. Those that stay on the ventilator for long periods tend to have a high mortality rate, and may stay on the ventilator for many weeks prior to dying. 8 A compartmental model that captures the conditions status and durations count susceptible population members , incubating , infectious asymptomatic , infectious symptomatic , infectious people who will be hospitalized , those hospitalized who recover , and hospitalized leading to mortality .

This eigenvalue determines the doubling time of the growth, and imposes one constraint on those coefficients; the eigenvectors impose three more constraints on the system, leaving five coefficients undetermined. Essentially, all of the ratelimiting relevant epidemic variables grow at the same rate maintaining fixed ratios. However, as they near peak, the variable trajectories become more differentiated, with lagging or leading peaks emerging as the impact of filters through the system of equations. However, at peak, it is already too late to allow time to acquire and deploy needed resources to hospitals and clinics. By itself, the trajectory of these models in pre-peak growth offer little hint as to final needs.

Examples are age structure in the population, which impacts both asymptomatic cases 11, 26 and severity of disease 8 . Identification of asymptomatic cases has been problematic since testing protocols tended to require symptoms, or contacts with known infected people. One case in California went untested for 10 days because she had no known contacts. Cases that advance to severe or critical depend on other factors, such as treatment modalities prior to development of advanced symptoms. The rate of transmission depends on physiological parameters as well as normal social distance and social distancing response to an epidemic, how public institutions such as schools are run, how grocery shopping interactions are handled, whether known infections are isolated and other factors specific to each community. Given how widely these parameters may vary from population to population, how they vary: how they depend on the geographically specific dominating SARS-COV-2 lineages dominant within a given geography 5, 6 , and how they depend on behavioral, social, age structure, and other factors of a population, it is worth seeking whether and how these factors relate to the expressed epidemic model rate parameters as phenotypes.",

That unsuitability does not reflect any attempt at obfuscation. Specifically, in this case, the use of testing, positive test counts, etc are tilted towards identifying patients who are likely to have specific treatment needs, and to try to identify contacts to stop epidemic spread. These uses render the reported statistics problematic for modeling. Physiological parameters based on identified patients may be biased in terms of the patients who were identified, and the methods by which they were identified.

Taking guidance from Table 1, values = 04748, and = 0.1071 yields a doubling time close to New York State from Figure 2c. Figure 1 presents a loglinear plot of the growth of the complete model equations integrated numerically using solve_ivp() employing RK45 from scipy, clearly showing that the early growth is dominated by a leading exponential mode. The early lead-in shows the effects of decaying modes as the initial conditions converge to the fixed ratios of the leading eigenmode components. The leading eigenvalue is = 0.1171, yielding a doubling time of 5.9 days, with eigenvector = ( 0.6457 0.4212 0.6369 0.0081 ).
