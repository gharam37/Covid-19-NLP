Extensive molecular surveillance in Guangdong, China's most populous province, during early 2020 resulted in 1,388 reported RNA positive cases from 1.6 million tests. In order to understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in China we generated 53 genomes from infected individuals in Guangdong using a combination of metagenomic sequencing and tiling amplicon approaches. Combined epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate multiple independent introductions to Guangdong, although phylogenetic clustering is uncertain due to low virus genetic variation early in the pandemic. Our results illustrate how the timing, size and duration of putative local transmission chains were constrained by national travel restrictions and by the province's large-scale intensive surveillance and intervention measures. Despite these successes, COVID-19 surveillance in Guangdong is still required as the number of cases imported from other countries is increasing.",

RT-PCR Ct (cycle threshold) values of these samples ranged from 19 to 40.86. Figure 2A displays the Ct values for the 53 samples with >50% genome coverage for which we report whole and partial genome sequences (see Figure S2 for details of all 79 samples). When Ct values are <30, sequence reads covered approximately 90% or more of the reference genome (GenBank accession number: MN908947.3) irrespective of the amplification and sequencing approach used (see Methods). However, genome coverage declined for samples with Ct >30 ( Figure S2 ). Using a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test we found an association between sample Ct values and sample type ( Figure 2B ; p<0.001), and sample Ct values and disease severity ( Figure 2C ; p=0.03; see also Liu et al. 2020 ).",

Despite this, there were a number of instances where sequences from Guangdong appeared to cluster together, sometimes with sequences sampled from other regions. To explore these lineages in more detail, we performed a Bayesian molecular clock analysis that places the phylogenetic history of the genomes on an estimated timescale. A summary visualisation of the maximum clade credibility tree from that analysis is shown in Figure 3B and is largely congruent with the ML tree. The current low genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes worldwide means that most internal nodes have very low posterior probabilities; we caution that no conclusions should be drawn from these branching events as they will be informed by the phylogenetic prior distribution rather than variable nucleotide sites ( Figure 3A ). Nevertheless, five clusters (denoted A-E) containing Guangdong sequences had posterior probability support of >80% (i.e. their sequences grouped monophyletically in over 80% of trees in the posterior sample; Figure 3B ). These clusters are also observed in ML phylogeny ( Figure 3A ). From the molecular clock analysis, we were able to estimate the times of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of clusteres A-E.

However, 6 of the 8 genomes in this cluster reported travel from Hubei and therefore the cluster in fact represents multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions into Guangdong, with dates of symptom onset around or shortly after the shutdown of travel from Wuhan (Figure 4) .",

Further, the low and variable sampling of COVID-19 cases among different regions makes it challenging to evaluate phylogenetic clusters that comprise cases from a single region; although such clusters could indeed represent local transmission, our results show they can also include multiple introductions from a genomically-undersampled location.

The resulting dataset of 250 sequences therefore represents the global diversity of the virus while minimizing the impact of sampling bias.

The ML phylogeny was estimated with PhyML (Guindon et al., 2010) using the HKY+\u2c844 substitution model (Hasegawa et al., 1985) with gamma-distributed rate variation (Yang, 1994) . Linear regression of root-to-tip genetic distance against sampling date indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 sequences evolve in clock-like manner (r = 0.539) ( Figure S4 ). The Bayesian coalescent tree analysis was undertaken in the BEAST (Ayres et al., 2012; Suchard et al., 2018) framework, also using the HKY+\u2c844 substitution model with gamma-distributed rate variation with an exponential population growth tree prior and a strict molecular clock. Taxon sets were defined and used to estimate the posterior probability of monophyly and the posterior distribution of the tMRCA of observed phylogenetic clusters A-E (Supplementary Table 1 ). Four independent chains were run for 100 million states and parameters and trees were sampled every 10,000 states. Upon completion, chains were combined using LogCombiner after removing 10% of states as burn-in and convergence was assessed with Tracer (Rambaut et al., 2018) . The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was inferred from the Bayesian posterior tree distribution using TreeAnnotator, and visualised with figtreejs-react (https://github.com/jtmccr1/figtreejs-react@9874a5b). Code for Figure 3B is available at https://github.com/jtmccr1/tree-for-oli and a live version of the tree can be found at https://jtmccr1.github.io/tree-for-oli/.

The average time between the tMRCA and the earliest sequence collection date in each cluster was approximately 10.5 days. The observed duration of each phylogenetic cluster (tMRCA to most recently sampled sequence) ranged from 13.8 (cluster B) to 45.5 (cluster D) days. The clusters with earlier tMRCAs contain more sequences sampled from travellers outside of China, possibly reflecting a decrease in air passenger travel from Guangdong after January 2020 (Flightradar 2020). The median tMRCA estimate of the COVID-19 pandemic was 29 th November 2019 (95% HPD 14 th November to 13 th December 2019), consistent with previous analyses (Rambaut 2020) (Figure 4). The apparent clusters of Guangdong sequences require careful interpretation, because of the relative undersampling of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from other Chinese provinces, including Hubei. Specifically, it is known that undersampling of regions with high incidence can lead to phylogenetic analyses underestimating the number of introductions into recipient locations, and overestimating the size and duration of transmission chains in those recipient locations (Grubaugh et al., 2017; Kraemer et al., 2018). For example, the largest Guangdong phylogenetic cluster comprises 8 sequences (denoted A in",
