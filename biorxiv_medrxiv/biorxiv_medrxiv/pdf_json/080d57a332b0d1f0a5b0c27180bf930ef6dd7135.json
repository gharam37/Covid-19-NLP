Hospitals are suffering the high degree of patients to be treated for respiratory diseases and the majority of the structures located in the north of Italy are or are going to be saturated. This has led the actual and past national and regional governments to be heavily criticized for reducing in the past years the number of beds, in particular those located in the ICUs across the country. Aim of this study is to analyse the availability of hospital beds across the country as well as to determine their management in terms of complexity and performance of cases treated at regional level. The results of this study underlines that, despite the reduction of beds for the majority of the hospital wards, ICUs availabilities did not change between 2010 and 2017. Moreover, this study confirms that the majority of the Italian regions efficiently manage these structural facilities allowing hospitals to treat patients without the risk of having an .

The first person-to-person transmission in Italy was reported on Feb 21st, 2020, and led to an infection chain that represents the largest COVID-19 outbreak outside Asia to date. At the moment, Italy is the second most affected country in the World and the first in Europe, with more than 62000 confirmed cases according to the Italian Department of Civil Protection as of 26th of March 2020. What it is not clearly identified so far is the reasons for the strong involvement of Italy within the European countries [2] and even more why the spread of this epidemic has not followed a uniform pattern on the territory: the diffusion of the disease, at the moment, is focused on the northern regions of the country. This was particularly evident considering that the virus took some days to reach the central and the southern regions of the land. Currently, the 87% of the confirmed actual cases are inhabitants of the northern regions that counts the 55% of the total Italian population. Among them, where the first cases were identified at the end February, is still the region with the majority of individuals infected by the COVID-19 virus. Similar results can be noted considering the hospitalization in general (88% in the northern regions and 42% in ) and in the intensive care unit in particular (85% in the northern regions and 35% in ). This data are provided and daily updated by the Italian Civil Protection Department [3] . These numbers are indicative of the spread of the infection and underline that one the main challenges to be faced by the National and the Regional Health Systems is the management of hospital resources across the country in terms of professionals, medical devices and hospital beds, with a particular attention on the intensive care unit (ICU) [4] .",

This lack of beds is confirmed by a recent study of the OECD that reported that our country counts 2.6 hospital beds per 1000 inhabitants [6] , ranking Italy at the 19 th place over 23 countries with Germany having more than 6 beds per 1000 inhabitants. However, this data does not consider the number of ICUs. The most recent study reporting the number of beds specifically for the ICU was published by Rhodes et al in 2012 [7] . Also in this case the number of beds located in Italy are below the European average with 12.9 beds per 100000 inhabitants, while Germany is equipped with 29.2 beds.

Specific attention is given to the management of the intensive care unit departments. In this perspective, there are two methodologies adopted to assess the efficiency of a health structure in the management of clinical hospitalized cases: the first one is the hospital bed management [8] [9] [10] that provides an overall description of the use of beds by health structures. The second methodology evaluates the performance of a hospital considering the complexity of the cases treated by the structure [11] [12] .

Administrative and clinical data produced during the hospitalization process are collected in Discharge Report Forms and sent by the hospital information systems of a single health provider and centrally collected by the Ministry of Health. They describe each service provided to a patient as well as facilities available and staff employed in the relevant structure. This information is aggregated and published in the web site of the Ministry of Health [14] . The data analysed in this study refer to the year 2017, the latest data published by the Ministry of Health. Moreover, data captured for the year 2010 are analysed to examine differences between 2010 and 2017 in terms of resources available across the territory.

As reported in the Table only oncology and intensive care unit wards have had an increase in the number of beds in Italy, while in other clinical specializations the reduction was even more than 20%, among which surgery, paediatrics and otolaryngology. This indicates that, among the wards that manage complex hospital cases, the availability of hospital beds was not affected by the funding cuts to public health. However, these crude differences may take into account that, in the last years, many European countries have adopted policies to strongly shift the organization and provision of health and social services from formal institutional facilities (e.g. hospitals) to home care [17] . Moreover, recently the provision of different scheduled procedures (e.g. diagnostic test, clinical examinations, treatments) are mainly provided in a day hospital, reducing the number of beds needed to treat the patients. Other differences that can be detected analysing the availability of hospital beds refers to their distribution in the 21 regions and autonomous provinces. Figure 3 reports the number of beds per 100.000 inhabitants both considering all disciplines (A) and focusing on the intensive care unit departments (B). The proportions vary across the country spanning from Molise that counts the highest values for both categories to Calabria that displays the lowest proportions. In this overall picture, while, generally, the south of Italy suffers the lack of hospital beds, lays in the middle of the rank with 279 beds in total and 8 intensive care unit beds per 100000 inhabitants. 2. The second group of regions (Calabria, Campania, Bolzano e Puglia) has similar results compared to the above cluster, with hospitalizations efficiently managed with high performances.

Differently other wards suffered of the financial cuts done by national and regional governments to the public health. However, this trend may also take into account two important factors. On the one hand, the provision of health services is now shifting from formal institutional facilities (e.g. hospitals) to home care and, on the other hand, different scheduled procedures are mainly provided in a day hospital reducing the number of beds needed to treat the patients. The majority of the Italian regions and in particular those in the northern part of the country can rely on an appropriate number of beds that generally do not saturate in periods when the patient flow is not conditioned by catastrophic events like what we have been going through these weeks. This availability of hospital beds as well as the efficiency in their management confirmed in this study allow hospitals to treat patients without the risk of having an overabundance of patients and a scarcity of beds. In fact, the analysis reported in this paper showed that, in normal situations, the management of hospital and intensive care beds has no critical levels, while in pandemic or other catastrophic periods, the hospital management paradigms change [18] .

As highlighted by the colour, different regions have had already saturated the hospital beds ordinarily available in their intensive care units (Lombardy, Piemonte, Val d'Aosta, Trento, Bolzano), with other regions that are worryingly approaching this threshold (Marche, Emilia Romagna, Toscana, Liguria).

Green cells highlight region where the indicators are above the relevant threshold. Note that while BOR and TOI thresholds are captured in the literature, those for the AvLOS and BTO are computed on the basis of the national average value. Considering the hospital bed management all regions fall within the threshold values both for the BOR and the TOI, with the exception of Molise, Basilicata and Sardegna. Instead, regional differences can be captured considering the AvLOS which highlights which are the regions that tend to extend the patient's hospital stays comparing to a national benchmarking value (i.e. Lombardy and Liguria) and the BTO that provides an overview of the regions that have a low number of patients as a percentage of available beds (i.e. Lombardy and Molise). The difference in the AvLOS across the country can determine the level of performance of each region also on the basis of the complexity of cases. On the basis of these analyses, regions have been classified in the following four macro-clusters, that mainly represent the classification of the complex and performance indicators as reported in Figure 4: 1. Six regions (Abruzzo, Emilia Romagna, Trento, Toscana, Umbria e Basilicata) reported positive results in the management of hospital beds. Moreover, these regions report high performances in the treatment of complex cases, mainly due to short hospitalization with respect to the national average length of stay.",

The macro-clusters detected on the basis of both analyses are summarized in the following (Figure 5): 1) In three regions (Calabria, Sardegna e Sicilia) all indicators report positive values with respect to the national average ones.
