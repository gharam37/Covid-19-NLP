            "text": "After the spread of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic out of China, evolution in the pandemic worldwide shows dramatic differences among countries. In Europe, the situation of Italy first and later Spain has generated great concern, and despite other countries show better prospects, large uncertainties yet remain on the future evolution and the efficacy of containment, mitigation or attack strategies. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we also incorporate effects of varying proportions of containment. We fit data to quarantined populations in order to account for the uncertainties in case reporting and study the scenario projections for the 17 individual regions (CCAA). Results indicate that with data for March 23, the epidemics follows an evolution similar to the isolation of 1, 5 percent of the population and if there were no effects of intervention actions it might reach a maximum over 1.4M infected around April27. The effect on the epidemics of the ongoing partial confinement measures is yet unknown (an update of results with data until March 31st is included), but increasing the isolation around ten times more could drastically reduce the peak to over 100k cases by early April, while each day of delay in taking this hard containment scenario represents an 90 percent increase of the infected population at the peak. Dynamics at the sub aggregated levels of CCAA show epidemics at the different levels of progression with the most worrying situation in Madrid an Catalonia. Increasing alpha values up to 10 times, in addition to a drastic reduction in clinical cases, would also more than halve the number of deaths. Updates for March 31st simulations indicate a substantial reduction in burden is underway. A similar approach conducted for Italy pre-and post-interventions also begins to suggest substantial reduction in both infected and deaths has been achieved, showing the efficacy of drastic social distancing interventions.",

It is assumed, however, that the infected are all quarantined (Q) and that they do not have contact with susceptible individuals. In turn, the susceptible population can be protected by confinement by moving to the protected population compartment (C). This assumption on Q means that hospital infections are not considered under this framework, therefore resulting in a potential underestimation of the real contagion extent. However, we chose this option in an attempt to be conservative and our results should be interpreted as the current best-case scenario.

            "text": "Epidemiological reports for the current situation of COVID-19 out of China indicate Europe is one of the centers of the pandemic, and that nearly 200 countries/regions worldwide have reported cases [1] . Particularly in Italy and Spain a large outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection is underway. Given the lack of previous exposure to this virus, future predictions of both the levels of virus spread in the global naive population and the acquired herd immunity cannot be properly anticipated. Data on the last similar pandemic one century ago remains limited for obvious reasons, despite aftermath reports exist [2] . Policymakers in the most affected countries face a difficult situation when trying to balance between draconian public health actions and keeping economy alive, as impact on health of severe economic measures is also well-known [3] . The fact that the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic had a second deadly epidemic wave, presumably caused by mutations in the H1N 1 viral strain [4] , has also stimulated a vivid debate on whether actions to take now should take into account this uncertain future. Under this scenario, optimal action on the COVID-19 pandemic is hard to fathom. And more so, for the extent of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections is not narrowly constrained (e.g. up to 86 percent [5] ). In China, regions as well as local governments, including Hubei, tightened preventive measures to curb the spreading of COVID-19 since Jan. 2020 [6] . Many cities in Hubei province were locked down and many measures implemented, such as tracing close contacts, quarantining infected cases, promoting social consensus on self-protection (e.g. wearing face mask in public area, minimum social distances). However, in other areas, the extent and efficacy of the so-called confinement or self isolation is doubtful, and facebook data on mobile location and movement showed yet massive people displacements under semi-confinement measures. At a time when success of large-scale social distancing interventions is critical, access to accurate information to ascertain mobility is lacking [7] . Similarly, credible serology tests that could show whether someone has had the infection and recovered are not yet massively deployed, thereby assessment of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the population is not established [8] .",

            "text": "We followed the approach of Peng et al. [6] and implemented a modified SEIR model that accounts for the spread of infection during the latent period. This novel capacity to significantly spread during the latent period is a distinctive feature of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic if compared to SARS in 2003. Therefore, many classical models such as SIR [9, 10, 11] , SEIR [11] and SEIJR [12] are not appropriate to describe the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in China and elsewhere. Thanks to new data on the average latent period and average time of treatment, this time delay process can be successfully incorporated in a novel dynamical system framework to describe this quite unique dynamics. It has been discussed that at times of ongoing epidemics, and due to errors and under reporting, accumulated numbers of diagnosed cases and even number of deaths might reflect more reliably the extent of epidemic progression than the daily reported new cases. Alternately, and as in Chen 2020 [9] and Peng et al. [6] we also employ the accumulated numbers in time as variables, as it was done also for modelling MERS-CoV in the recent past [13] . Isolating key segments of populations (e.g. vulnerable populations, workers providing essential services, or a territory with too fast growing incidences) to protect them from an uncontrolled epidemic progression, is under vivid discussion as the real extent of viral spread in the population is not well known. Both the limited diagnostic capacity and the lack of clear strategies and mechanisms to quarantine infectious individuals, stand as two of the main limitations to control disease spread. Countries such as South Korea [14, 15] and Taiwan [16, 17] rapidly deployed aggressive contact tracing and quarantine systems [18] , understanding that early deployment of resources to try to control initial seeding foci, often not only balances public health criteria but also economics. Given the differences in public health strategies and the varying capacity of the national health systems in each country to tackle the extent of the infection in the population, the growing proportions of undiagnosed infected that eventually show up, are seen to exert an elevated stress on the already saturated health's system capacities. It is therefore relevant to accurately evaluate the effects of the social distancing actions imposed by governments, such as the individual or territory isolation and interruption of labour activity and/or intra and inter-urban transportation. Such strong provisions of isolation for suspected cases and infection due to contact with undiagnosed individuals are also taken into account in our modelling approach. This same SEIR model has been utilised to compare the effects of lock-down of Hubei province on the transmission dynamics in Wuhan and Beijing [6] . The manuscript is organised as follows: in Section 2, we describe the dynamic model and datasets used to simulate the evolution of the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain and in its 17 administrative regions (CCAA), as well as in Italy. The effect on the epidemic curves of the efficacy of the different intervention measures aggregated for Spain, is presented in Section 3.1. Section 3.2 provides estimates of the future number of diagnosed people, fatalities and recovered individuals for each individual CCAA prediction as of March 23 and the main active foci in Section 3.3. Section 3.4 addresses model uncertainties and limitations of our study, and we add results for Italy pre-and post-interventions in Section 3.5. We finally discuss efficacy of the actions in each case and territory in terms of health burden and report and provide an update of the situation up to March 31st.",

The shortest time series used was of 5 days from February 29 to March 3 and the longest covered up to March 31. The temporal span of the time series used can seriously affect the value of the fitted parameters. This is especially true at the beginning of the epidemic when the relationship between infected, dead and recovered is not entirely clear. For example if the number of confirmed cases is small, it is difficult to ascertain whether the quarantine has been rigorously applied or not. In addition, such under-representation would suggest that the number of infectious people is much larger than the number of confirmed cases.

Gaining extra time for exerting alternative interventions, such as temporary increases in public health responses, or increasing the capacity of massively screening the population in order to gain an accurate value of the real prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, or to develop disease treatment strategies seem a logical conclusion. While two of the most populated CCAA (namely Catalunya with roughly 7.7M people and Madrid Community, with 6.7M people) are already in the lead in terms of epidemic progression, other similarly populated regions lag only a few days entering a similar slope in their respective epidemic growths. The largest population density in Madrid compared to other CCAA together with its more advanced epidemic progression cast urgent attention on the evolution of this highly active epidemic focus. Those regions where the outbreak was initiated earlier (e.g. Madrid, Catalunya, Euskadi and Navarra) or appear to have more connectivity to the initial foci and largest population density tend to show earlier peaks. Those regions yet on early stages of the exponential increase are those where strong initial social isolation measures (therefore protection of the population), would have largest effects in resulting infected ( Figure  2 ).",

For the curve to happen as shown, the simulation assumes the initial conditions hold, therefore if that were not the case and measures were lifted before the epidemic reaches R 0 \u2248 1, infections might rise again. Improvements can be achieved with a more complete integration of time delay coordinates in classical SEIR models [6] . This way, both the incubation period and the period before recovery, as well as the precise role of asymptomatic population can be better represented at times when these information is highly uncertain. A substantial gain in the epidemic projection in the form of reduced infections in the population would already be achieved with a four-times rise in the efficacy of the control situation we had around March 9 \u2212 16. This was the time when social distancing/confinement was imposed (March 13). Time will show to which extent current measures manage to increase the value of alpha.

Those at major risk now are Italy and Spain, and for them, efficacy of the partial confinement or total lockdown effects are yet unknown. Under this situation, we implemented a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for infection from undiagnosed individuals and for different levels of population isolation, to evaluate effects of contacts reduction in the epidemic temporal dynamics. Among the advantages of the implemented model, it should be noted that despite the simplicity of the hypotheses, the adjustments obtained were accurate and the projections made do not differ much from those other of more complex models. Also instantaneous increment of cumulative diagnosed people depends on the history of cumulative infected people, by which the latent period can be taken into consideration. The results of the implemented control scenarios for March 23 show that a drastic isolation of the susceptible population should be implemented as soon as possible. For even not so drastic increases in alpha (two or three times the current rate) imply also significant reductions in the incidence of cases. The adjustments made in different CCAA also serve to verify the efficacy of the isolation hypothesis for the most affected communities (Madrid and Catalunya). They also serve as a basis for timely action in those communities that do not yet have a significant number of cases that jeopardises their health systems. Policymakers should weigh in the values and ethical considerations of employing now maximum strength in actions to help reduce the slope of the epidemic curve against the enormous associated economic cost. However, our study indicates that a three-weeks interruption of labor activities, thereby a drastic reduction in contacts, could end the current epidemic in around two months and drastically reduce both the burden of this disease, and much lower the toll of lives. Our results could also provide useful suggestions for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreaks in different countries and locations such as Argentina and USA lagging the current epidemic wave in Spain and Italy. These represents two very different scenarios. In the case of the USA, no radical control measure was initially implemented by the federal government and the epidemic seems to be in a phase of uncontrolled growth. On the Argentina side, the health authorities seem to have taken note of what is happening in Europe and more strict movement restrictions have been implemented, although it is difficult to determine the degree of commitment by the population. 6 All rights reserved.

This lack of spatial granularity may affect the accuracy of simulations when the spread of infections in a territory reaches and takes off in a populated city. The former might alter results producing more new cases than expected, exactly what the aggregation for CCAA data clearly shows. Spatial modelling should also be incorporated explicitly and extension of this modelling approach to incorporate movement of individuals should follow. Results should be interpreted with care as projections at these initial stages of the epidemic are very dependent on the quality of data, with small changes in observed values producing large variations in trends. However, even with this limitation in mind, the magnitude of positive increments in cases suggests these results are strong. Variable isolation strength measures can be tested with this model and inform governments of the most probable effects of their actions on the initial course of the COVID-19 disease. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

Given the large associated uncertainties and enormous public health and economic costs, timely actions at this point might represent large gains or losses. To aid in this respect, we simulated the effect of imposing stricter measures of social distancing also on two of the most active foci, namely Madrid and Catalunya. Madrid was the CCAA were the initial outbreak evolved more rapidly and on March 23, it concentrates over 30 percent of total cases and a large majority of deaths. Similarly, Catalunya is now showing a significant increase in new infected and both areas share similar populations albeit Madrid has in comparison, higher population density. Results are shown in",
