Italy, on the other hand, up to the same day, had close to 64 thousand confirmed cases of infection, around 6 thousand deaths, and a CFR of 9.5%. On March 16, Italy had roughly the same number of cases as Germany on March 24, and a CFR of 7.7%. Thus, the outbreak in Italy is going along with a much higher CFR, and the CFR increased over time [2, 3] . Differences in the CFR could indicate that the risk of dying of COVID-19 among detected cases differs between countries or changes within a population over time. On the other hand, it could also imply compositional differences in the detected infections [1, 3] . Specifically, the risk of dying of COVID-19 is well-documented to increase with age. Thus, if the population of infected individuals is older in one country or time period than in another, the CFR will be higher, even if the age-specific risk of dying is the same.",

However, it is also plausible that the extensive testing itself in these countries prevented undetected community spread to older population groups.

The difference to the actual CFR (the whole expression) then captures to what extent the CFR is higher than this hypothetical CFR because of the actually observed age distribution of detected infections. The third and the fourth term in brackets in the equation for are following a similar logic, but using a different hypothetical comparison, asking how much the CFR of group would differ if the detected cases had the age distribution of group . The formula for again follows a similar logic, but now replacing the age-specific CFRs instead of the age distribution.

The age groups provided for France, Germany, and the United States are problematic, as they do not match the age groups of any other country. Aggregating the age groups, as for Italy, does not help, either. For instance, the age category of 15 years to 44 years available for France cannot be created based on the German data. To deal with this issue, we adjusted the case counts and death counts for France, Germany, and the United States using a smoothing approach, which is able to estimate counts for age groups 0-9, 10-19, \u2026, 80+ [9] .",
