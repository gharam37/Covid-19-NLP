            "text": "Novel Coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) related to Coronavirus that caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic 10 years ago, was first detected in Saudi Arabia and it has been spreading in other countries since 2012[1]. In December 2019, China noticed few pneumonia cases relating to novel Coronavirus (2019-nCOV). Told case incidence has been increasing dramatically and reached the hundreds, but it is likely to be an under-estimate [2] . The Coronavirus menace has now been spread all over the countries in globe. As of March 24, 2020, there were 372757 confirmed Novel Coronavirus-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) cases in 196 countries of which 16224 death cases were traced out worldwide [3] . This endemic of novel Coronavirus has been caused due to the mobility and interaction of people who moved from one country to another by outbound fights. Therefore, we argue that densely populated countries as well as cities are more likely to be infected with novel Coronavirus because of inbound and outbound flights and other means of transports. It implies that both in-bound and out-bound flights of passengers are significant factors in triggering Coronavirus infection risk in more densely populated countries than in less densely populated countries. However, previous studies did not consider the population density factor while modeling the risk of 2019-nCOV transmission. Recent studies estimates the risk of Coronavirus transmission from the Chinese cities to other destinations [4, 5] . More importantly, Haider et al. (2020) built a risk index using the number of air travelers multiplied by the weight of the number of infected cases. Apart from previous studies, our study can fill the research gap constructing a risk index that takes population density and size, case identification rate, and the number of air travel into account.",

We also consider mobility-interaction factor to estimate the risk of spreading infectious diseases as mobility and interaction among people contribute to spread infectious diseases according to some studies [6] [7] [8] . So, it is expected that the higher the mobility and interaction among people in an area, the higher the risk of spreading infectious diseases. We can call it \"Mobility-Interaction Effect\". The reasoning behind such hypothesis is that people have the tendency to amass in an area which provides better environment, livelihood, education, and other amenities. The aggregation process continues further with the economic development, forcing people to move low density areas to high density areas. As a result, people living in high density areas have higher mobility and interaction among themselves than the people living in low density areas [9] . Therefore, we propose that Relative Mobility-Interaction Effect (RMIE) can be estimated by the relative population density of that area within a country.",

The index says that there is a risk of Coronavirus spreading even though the travel specific risk component becomes zero. That means even if a country imposes air travel restriction internationally, the risk of transmission still exists. The area specific component of the index actually portrays the dynamics of infectious disease spreading influenced by mobility and interaction among people. One of the important implications of the area specific component is that restricting international movement is not sufficient to contain the risk of Coronavirus spreading in particular and infectious diseases in general. Internal restriction is also important to suppress transmission risk in an area which is exactly what the current situation says. In that sense, we expect that our index has the higher probability of mimicking the current situation of Coronavirus.",

As per report of 26 March 2020, about 38262 Coronavirus cases are detected in this state, and the value of RI is 0.00691484 which clearly shows the severity of infection comparing to others. Besides, some other areas such as Hubei (China), Massachusetts (US), District of Columbia (US), New Jersey (US) , Georgia (US), Colorado (US), Illinois (US), Michigan (US) and Maryland (US) are ranked 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th respectively as per calculation of RI. Besides, Quebec is ranked 20th whereas Alberta is ranked 57th among Provinces in Canada. Moreover, Australian Capital Territory, Australia is ranked 29th followed by New South Wales in 49th position. More interestingly, remaining Chinese Provinces are ranked at the bottom of the table, implying less risk of Coronavirus infection in China comparing to US, Canada and Australia.",
