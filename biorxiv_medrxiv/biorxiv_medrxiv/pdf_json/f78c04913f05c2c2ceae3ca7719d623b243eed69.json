Using a combination of comparative structural analyses of the binding surface of the S protein to ACE2, docking experiments, and molecular dynamics simulations we computationally identified a minimal, stable fragment of ACE2. This fragment binds to the S protein, is soluble, and appears not to bind to the physiological ligand angiotensinII. These results suggest a possible use of the ACE2 fragment as a decoy that could interfere with viral binding by competition.",

            "text": "The entry of the novel SARS-Cov-2 into the host cell is mediated by the interaction between the viral transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein and the cellular membrane receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (1) . The S glycoprotein is synthesized as a precursor of about 1,300 amino acids that is then cleaved into an amino N-terminal S1 subunit of about 700 amino acids and a carboxyl C-terminal S2 subunit of about 600 amino acids. Three S1-S2 heterodimers assemble to form a trimer protruding from the viral surface. The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD), while the S2 subunit contains a hydrophobic fusion peptide. Upon receptor binding, the S1 subunit is cleaved, and the fusion S2 subunit undergoes a conformational rearrangement to form a six-helix bundle that mediates viral and cellular membrane fusion (2) . The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-related carboxypeptidase, ACE2, is a type I integral membrane protein of about 805 amino acids that contains one HEXXH + E zinc-binding consensus sequence. ACE2 is a close homolog of the somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1), a peptidyl dipeptidase that plays an important role in the renin-angiotensin system. ACE2 sequence includes an N-terminal signal sequence (amino acids 1 to 18), a potential transmembrane domain (amino acids 740 to 763), and a potential metalloprotease zinc-binding site (amino acids 374 to 378, HEMGH). The internal cavity hosts the angiotensinI substrate (consisting of aminoacids 1 to 10 of the angiotensinogen precursor) that ACE2 converts into angiotensinII (amino acids 1 to 8) (3, 4) . ACE2 is expressed mainly in heart, kidney, testis, smooth muscle, and in coronary vessels and it seems to increase in lately differentiated epithelial tissues (5) . The expression of ACE2 seems inversely regulated by the expression levels of ACE, a key regulator of blood pressure and the target of the pharmacological ACE inhibitors that control blood pressure (6). X-ray and cryo-EM structures of complexes between the viral S protein from different Coronaviruses both alone and in complex with ACE2 have been solved (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . Here we analyzed the crystallographic and cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the S-proteins from SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov-2, human ACE2, and their complexes. We studied the structural features of the binding of ACE2 to S-protein, and performed molecular docking experiments in order to determine the interaction energy between the S protein and ACE2 residues.",

Lys353 is anchored to the N-terminal ACE2 helix by Tyr41 and Asp38, and it contributes almost 10 percent of the total interaction energy. An additional small downstream helix contributes negligibly to the total binding energy.

To determine whether the double-helix fragment has the potential to bind to angion-tensinII, possibly interfering with that physiological system, we performed docking of angiotensinII to ACE2 ( Figure 3 ). As shown by the docking results, the angiotensinII binding site is located in an internal cavity of the receptor, quite far from the surface where the viral S-protein binds. Most of the residues of ACE2 involved in binding to angiotensinII are internal to the core of the protein. Only two amino acids (Asp51 and Ser47) in \u03b1-helix 1 have appreciable interactions with angiotensinII, and contribute about 15 percent of the total interaction energy as predicted by RosettaDock. These results suggest that the double-helix fragment is highly unlikely to interfere with angiotensinII in a physiological context.",

These key residues are found in the two N-terminal back-to-back helices 1 and 2, spanning about 60 amino acids and contributing most of the predicted interaction energy between ACE2 and the SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-Cov proteins. An ideal fragment would also include the downstream betahairpin carrying the conserved Lys353. However, this residue is too far in the primary structure from the double helices. A cut and seal between these two binding regions is unlikely to work due to the unpredictable folding of the resulting chimeric structure. Therefore, we propose to use the doublehelix fragment as a candidate for effectively inhibiting the S-protein.",

Further, the fragment does not appear to interfere with the physiological ligand of ACE2 (an-giotensinII), which is part of the renin-angiotensin system involved in the regulation of blood pressure. We would expect this fragment to be relatively easy to express and purify at a large-scale level 1 . Since this fragment is derived from a protein that is normally expressed in human tissues, the fragment should be relatively safe to use. The fragment might be administered directly by aereosol, avoiding the systemic route and possible degradation of the peptide. Additionally, the fragment might also be employed for diagnostic purposes. For example, immobilized on a substrate for a Biacore test, the fragment could serve as a quick binding assay to detect viral particles.",

The protein structures were placed in a cubic box with 10\u00c5 from the box edge and solvated with spc216.gro, an equilibrated 3-point solvent model. Next, we added ions to the system with the genion module and performed 50,000 steps of energy minimization. We then carried out equilibration in two steps: NVT (canonical) ensemble followed by NPT (isothermic-isobaric). For the NVT equilibration phase, we set the target temperature to 300 K and inspected the temperature graph over time (100 ps) to make sure the system was stabilized around the target temperature value. For the NPT equilibration phase, we used the Parrinello-Rahman barostat, and inspected the density values over time (100 ps) to check the stability of the system. After the equilibration steps, we ran a 100 ns production run on a GPU-accelerated machine. All MD simulations were performed with the same protocol and a time step of 2 fs.
