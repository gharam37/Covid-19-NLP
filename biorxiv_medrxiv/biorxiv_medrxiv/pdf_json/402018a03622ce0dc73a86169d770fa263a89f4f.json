MRI was negative whereas EEG showed theta waves on the anterior brain regions. Serum and CSF analyses excluded other known infectious or autoimmune disorders. The patient dramatically improved after high-doses steroid treatment suggesting an inflammatory-mediated brain involvement related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. All rights reserved.

At admission, a lumbar puncture was performed, and CSF showed inflammatory findings with mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (18/uL) and moderate increase of CSF protein (696 mg/dL). The analysis of neurotropic viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2, HSV-6, HSV-8, EBV, VZV and Adenovirus) was negative. CSF RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was also negative. An electroencephalography (EEG) exhibited a generalized slowing, more prominent on the anterior regions with decreased reactivity to acoustic stimuli ( Figure 1 ). The same day an empirical treatment of ampicillin and acyclovir was introduced. The day after, a Brain Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) with Gadolinium did not reveal significant alterations or contrast-enhanced areas within brain and/or meninges ( Figure 1 ). Three days after admission, given the persistence of clinical symptoms, a high intravenous steroid treatment was started (methylprednisolone 1 g/day for five days). CSF analyses, carried out one day after steroids administration, showed lymphocytic pleocytosis (18/uL), hyperproteinorrachia (1272 mg/dL) and normal Link index without oligoclonal bands. CSF RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was still negative.",

Lack of presence of COVID-19 in two different CSF samples analyses could not definitely exclude the diffusion into the CNS, as viruses could enter in CSF and be cleared from it by the time of illness onset, such as in the case of West-Nile virus 14 .
