Supportive care can also be called comfort care, palliative care, or symptom management. Supportive care can improve the quality of life of patients who have a serious or life-threatening disease, such as cancer (2) . Besides, for patients with respiratory diseases, supportive care also is an important and effective part of the management (3) . A systematic review related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) treatment suggested that meticulous supportive care is the only form of treatment that can be recommended (4) . Another systematic review showed that continuous monitoring of vital signs outside the critical care setting is feasible and may provide a benefit in terms of improved patient outcomes and cost efficiency (5) . According to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines there is currently no treatment recommended for coronavirus infections except supportive care as needed (6) .",

As of 12 April 2020, more than 1,690,000 cases and more than 100,000 deaths have been confirmed according to the WHO (8) . The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , has had been declared a global pandemic (9) However, there is so far no effective treatment or vaccine to curb the spread of the epidemic. Thus, we conducted this overview to identify the available and effective forms of supportive care for patients with respiratory diseases. We hope this review will help physicians working on COVID-19 to understand more about supportive care and make decisions on treatment selection for COVID-19.",

Second, none of the included systematic reviews focused on COVID-19, SARS or MERS, so they can be only used as indirect evidence. Finally, there was large heterogeneity between the included studies, and most primary studies included in these systematic reviews were observational studies, which may influence the reliability of the reviews.

One study explored the effects of prone ventilation on oxygenation index and mortality in patients with ARDS (Figure 2).Of the 11 systematic reviews and meta-analyses on ECMO, seven reported the impact of ECMO on ARDS; four of them reviewed the impact of ECMO on ARDS in adults, and the results of the four studies showed that ECMO did not reduce the mortality of adults. There was large heterogeneity between the included studies in the reviews. One study reported that mortality in ECMO group was lower than control group in the subgroup of Chinese patients [OR=0.39, 95% CI, 0.17-0.86]. Another article reported that the probability of experiencing at least one adverse event of ECMO varied greatly between studies, with a range of 1.1%-100%. Two other meta-analyses reported a reduction in ARDS related mortality in patients having venovenous ECMO. Both meta-analyses showed that mortality was significantly lower in the venovenous ECMO group than in the control group. However, both studies also reported an association between venovenous ECMO and bleeding. Finally, one study reported the mortality rate in patients receiving extracorporeal life support (ELS) for the treatment of ARDS. Meta-analysis showed that ELS failed to show any survival benefit in ARDS patients, and the heterogeneity among studies was large; All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Eight studies evaluated the impact of the prone position on the mortality, showing that the mortality in the prone position was significantly lower than that in the supine position [OR= 0.63, 95% CI, 0.51-0.78, P<0.001].Monitoring of vital signsThree systematic reviews and meta-analyses explored the impact of monitoring vital signs and symptoms on influenza patients and the general population (Figure 2). One systematic review published in 2018 assessed if continuous monitoring is practical outside of the critical care setting, and whether it confers any clinical benefit to patients. The majority of studies showed benefits such as less need for critical care and shorter hospital stay. Larger studies were more likely to demonstrate clinical benefit, particularly in the need of critical care use and length of hospital stay. Barriers to implementation of monitoring of symptoms and vital signs included concerns about the negative effects among nurses and patients, and the burden of false alerts. In summary, continuous monitoring of vital signs outside the critical care setting is feasible and may provide a benefit in terms of improved patient outcomes. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2016 identified strategies to improve the monitoring of intermittent or continuous vital signs and prevent adverse events in general hospital wards. The results suggested that strategies for monitoring All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
