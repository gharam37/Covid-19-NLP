Here, we estimate from European data that COVID-19 cases are expected to double initially every three days, until social distancing interventions slow this growth, and that the impact of such measures is typically only seen nine days -i.e. three doubling times -after their implementation. We argue that such temporal patterns are more critical than precise estimates of the basic reproduction number for initiating interventions. This observation has particular implications for the low-and middle-income countries currently in the early stages of their local epidemics.",

In Italy, a national lockdown was implemented on 9 March 2020 once 7,375 confirmed cases and 366 deaths had been recorded; only in the last few days (as of 29 March) the epidemic seems to be slowing down [5] . In comparison, India declared a nationwide lockdown on 24 March 2020, with only 434 confirmed cases and 0 deaths [6, 7] . Similarly, South Africa began a 21-day lockdown on 27 th March, with 927 known cases and 0 deaths [8, 9] . The implementation of such early and aggressive control measures in India and South Africa may substantially increase their chances of successful containment, although the social and personal cost could be substantial [10] .",

Most official sources settle in the range of 2-3 [3, [12] [13] [14] [15] , but these estimates mostly derive from early studies of the epidemic in Wuhan [16] [17] [18] , or the Diamond Princess Cruise ship [19] , and so are subject to important limitations: these include small amounts of data, uncertain or biased reporting of early cases in Wuhan, and the uniqueness of the specific settings in which they occurred.",

To avoid relying only on case confirmation, which could be affected by numerous biases, we also estimate the growth rate in hospitalisations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths in Italy ( Figure 1B ; [5] ). To ensure generalisability of results, we performed another analysis on a larger set of European countries ( Figure 2 ). With the exception of a few countries with a small number of cases and potentially unreliable data, we consistently find doubling times of about 3 days or less, that appear to be sustained before mitigation interventions are put in place ( Figure 2 ). These are significantly shorter than early estimates from China [16, 29] . For robustness, we have used two different methods: semiparametric and generalised linear (details in Materials and Methods). Unsurprisingly, the results differ in terms of their confidence intervals, but the conclusions are similar, and are in agreement with the common exploratory analysis based on visually inspecting data plotted on a logarithmic scale ( Figure S3 ).",

Early detection of cases during the incubation period, before individuals have become symptomatic, is typically not possible once containment has failed since it relies on full contact tracing and testing of asymptomatic individuals. Detecting cases at symptom onset is potentially more feasible, but in practice depends on the case-finding strategy. For example, in the UK, symptomatic individuals are instructed to self-isolate at home, and are only tested if they subsequently require hospitalisation. Thus the delay between infection and case detection includes the incubation period, the time between symptom onset and hospitalisation, and the time it takes to receive a positive test result.

For both countries, we plot the numbers of new cases and notice a visible drop occurring 8-9 days after the first, relatively soft, control measures were implemented (in the UK, recommended self-isolation if symptomatic on 13 March, and in Italy, lockdown of infected towns and school and university closure in Northern Italy, on 22-23 February). After the first control measure in the UK ( Figure 3A ), cases continued to increase exponentially with an estimated growth rate of ~0.22/day (corresponding to a doubling time of just over 3 days) for 9 days. During this period numbers of daily confirmed cases rose approximately 8-fold. Subsequently, the number of new infections started to tail off. A similar pattern is observed in Italy ( Figure 3B ). Because nonpharmaceutical interventions, with unknown compliance, cannot be evaluated until their effects emerge in the data, a pattern of introduction of increasingly strong measures has repeated across Europe, with long delays to control. Even with immediate hard interventions halting all community transmission, within-household transmission will continue to occur, creating an additional delay between the beginning of the intervention and its effect. This is consistent with the approximate 2-week delay from lockdown to peak in new cases observed in Hubei [4] . Further delays in case-confirmations, hospitalisations, potential ICU admissions and deaths mean the latter figures keep on growing well after transmission control is achieved.",

First, there is sufficient evidence worldwide that interventions must be draconian, particularly in countries where case numbers are high. Second, given the variability in R 0 estimates obtained from the same growth rate appear predominantly due to the assumed amount of pre-symptomatic transmission, the exact value of R 0 is only poorly correlated with the required aggressiveness of the intervention [38] . For example, if R 0 is four and most of the transmission occurs after symptoms onset, 75% of the transmission needs to be stopped and self-isolation when symptomatic can easily achieve this. Conversely, if R 0 is two but most of the transmission is pre-symptomatic, only 50% of the transmission needs to be prevented, but in practice this can only be achieved through interventions, like quarantining apparently healthy individuals, that are highly socially disruptive and likely enforced rather than spontaneous. Finally, R 0 informs how aggressive interventions should be, but not how quickly they should be implemented.",

At unconstrained growth, even the immense effort of doubling local hospital capacity only buys 3 days of reprieve before bed capacity is breached. Being blind to the extent of an epidemic and the true number of infections at any one time results in intervention strategies based on the number of observed cases and measurements of R 0 . For COVID-19, these are insufficient and dangerously underestimate the true degree of intervention required to slow down and bring the epidemic under control. We advocate stronger action from national and international health care communities, with a particular focus on supporting lowand middle-income countries where numbers of cases, at the time of writing, appear to be relatively low. In settings where health care capacity is low and intergenerational mixing common, swift action will save numerous lives.

To understand how long until the impact of an intervention may be observed, we need to understand the delay between infection and symptom onset (the incubation period), and the delay from onset to hospitalisation. A difficulty with estimating delay distributions during an outbreak is that events are only observed if they occur before the final sampling date. Since delay distributions depend on the time between two events, if the first event occurs near to the end of the sampling window, it will only be observed if the delay to the second event is short. This causes an over-expression of short delays towards the end of the sampling window, which is exacerbated by the exponential growth of the epidemic. Therefore, we need to account for this growth and truncation within our model.",

These cases have been removed from the data set, since they do not provide insight into the delay. Additionally, some cases have no symptom onset, so these have also been removed from the data. For cases where symptom onset and hospitalisation occur on the same day, we add half a day to the hospitalisation day, since the delay is unlikely to be instantaneous.

To compare different regions, we also use data from Hong Kong and Singapore to estimate the local onset to hospitalisation delays. This data is taken from an open access line-list [33 ] , and the filtered data sets used are provided in the supplementary material. Using the method above, for Hong Kong the mean delay is 4.41 days, with standard deviation 4.63, and for Singapore the mean delay is 2.62 with standard deviation 2.38. For the incubation period, we use data from Wuhan during the early stages of the outbreak. This data was extracted from an open access line-list [33 ] , containing dates when individuals were in Wuhan and when they developed symptoms (among other information). Since this data is from the early stages of the epidemic, the majority of cases were in Wuhan. Therefore, it is likely that these individuals were infected in Wuhan, so the time spent in Wuhan provides a potential exposure window during which infection occurred. For individuals with symptom onset date before leaving Wuhan or the same day they left Wuhan, the upper bound on the exposure window was adjusted to half a day before symptom onset.
