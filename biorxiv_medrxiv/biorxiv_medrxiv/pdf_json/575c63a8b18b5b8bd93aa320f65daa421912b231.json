Based on this initial classification, positive cases can be referred for further highly sensitive testing (e.g. CT scan, or specific antibodies). We used publicly available data from the Albert Einstein Hospital in Brazil from 5,644 patients. Focusing on simple blood exam figures as main predictors, a sample of 599 subjects that had the fewest missing values for 16 common exams were selected. From these 599 patients, 81 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (determined by RT-PCR). Based on the reduced dataset, we built an artificial intelligence classification framework, ER-CoV, aiming at determining if suspect patients arriving in ER were likely to be negative for SARS-CoV-2, that is, to predict if that suspect patient is negative for COVID-19. The primary goal of this investigation is to develop a classifier with high specificity and high negative predictive values, with reasonable sensitivity.",

Serologic tests are valuable for epidemiological purposes, but are best used retrospectively, once it takes weeks to develop specific IgG antibodies 19 . Such time gap between the beginning of infection symptoms and definitive diagnosis is a challenge for managing patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. Having a model based on simple and fast biochemical laboratory exams may help hospitals to build a more efficient patient flow management, while definitive confirmatory exams are not available. Hospitals would be able to provide better isolation of COVID-19 patients, given that blood samples could be drawn on a daily basis and ER-CoV would identify patients that should be moved to another ward (say, a ward for suspected positive patients).

The ER-CoV method is low-cost and relies only on simple blood exams that are fast and highly available, and resort to artificial intelligence methods to model such patients. We achieved significant results and foresee many applications of this framework. We thus support additional initiatives such as this one by the Albert Einstein Hospital, since the availability of data on COVID-19 tests allows the proposition of AI-based methods that could support medical decision and may provide important insights in longitudinal studies on the progression of the disease.",
