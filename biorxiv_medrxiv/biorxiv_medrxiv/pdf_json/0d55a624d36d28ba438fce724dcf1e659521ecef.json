            "text": "Rapidly responding to novel pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, represents an extremely challenging and complex endeavor. Numerous promising therapeutic and vaccine research efforts to mitigate the catastrophic effects of COVID-19 pandemic are underway, yet an efficacious countermeasure is still not available. To support these global research efforts, we have used a novel computational pipeline combining machine learning, bioinformatics, and supercomputing to predict antibody structures capable of targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). In 22 days, using just the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and previously published neutralizing antibody structures for SARS-CoV-1, we generated 20 initial antibody sequences predicted to target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. As a first step in this process, we predicted (and publicly released) structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using homology-based structural modeling. The predicted structures proved to be accurate within the targeted RBD region when compared to experimentally derived structures published weeks later. Next we used our in silico design platform to iteratively propose mutations to SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies (known not to bind SARS-Cov-2) to enable and optimize binding within the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Starting from a calculated baseline free energy of -48.1 kcal/mol (\u00b1 8.3), our 20 selected first round antibody structures are predicted to have improved interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with free energies as low as -82.0 kcal/mole. The baseline SARS-CoV-1 antibody in complex with the SARS-CoV-1 RBD has a calculated interaction energy of -52.2 kcal/mole and neutralizes the virus by preventing it from binding and entering the human ACE2 receptor. These results suggest that our predicted antibody mutants may bind the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and potentially neutralize the virus. Additionally, our selected antibody mutants score well according to multiple antibody developability metrics. These antibody designs are being expressed and experimentally tested for binding to COVID-19 viral proteins, which will provide invaluable feedback to further improve the machine learning-driven designs. This technical report is a high-level description of that effort; the Supplementary Materials includes the homology-based structural models we developed and 178,856 in silico free energy calculations for 89,263 mutant antibodies derived from known SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies. : bioRxiv preprint",

This combined platform combines experiment-driven, data-driven, and theory-driven approaches to leverage the strength of each approach, while mitigating their limitations. The initial predictions from this platform are driven by a computational component based on integrating existing experimental data, structural biology/bioinformatic modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations on high-performance computing systems. An active machine learning model aims to optimize binding behavior by iteratively proposing mutations to the amino acid sequence of an initial antigen. Proposed mutant antigens are evaluated with existing computational binding estimation tools using known or estimated antibody-antigen structures. The platform leverages a feature representation of the three-dimensional antigenantibody interface and a Bayesian optimization algorithm to propose computational evaluation of mutants with high predicted performance and mutants that improve the machine learning model itself. The computational platform further improves its predictions by proposing designs that are evaluated with a high throughput experimental evaluation component, the results of which are incorporated into the machine learning model in a feedback loop. This combined computational-experimental antigen design platform, and results generated by it, will be described in greater detail in a future joint publication with GSK, including details of the machine learning model.",

The high similarity of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, including the RBD [12] , suggest that such an approach could produce efficacious therapeutic antibodies.

The structures of the spike proteins from SARS-CoV-1 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries: 5x58 [15] , 6nb6 [10] , 2dd8 [11] , and 3bgf [16] ) were identified as the closest and most complete PDB structural templates to use for modeling, with resolutions 3.2, 4.2, 2.3, and 3.0 \u00c5 respectively. Of the four templates, the last three provide experimentally solved complexes with three antibodies, S230, M396, and F26G19. As our main focus in constructed homology models was to achieve the highest possible accuracy in the RBD-FAB (antigen-binding fragment) interfaces we used additional PDB templates to refine models in corresponding regions. For example, PDB template 2ghw [17] was used to improve accuracy in the modeled interface between RBD and FAB of neutralizing antibody 80R.",

FoldX binding calculations estimate the change in free energy (ddG) of the antibody-antigen protein complex resulting from the proposed mutations (to M396). We used this calculation as part of an objective function to drive the antibody optimization via the machine learning model. We evaluated 89,263 mutants with FoldX during the course of our search for improved antibodies with estimated ddG values ranging from -10.1 to 19.2 kcal/mole. Figure 3 plots improvements in the FoldX-estimated ddG values over the course of the machine learning-driven optimization process. These results indicate that the machine learning model was effective in searching the combinatorial space of possible antibody mutants to perform design optimization and identify increasingly improved predicted antibody designs. We then selected a subset of these antibody mutants for additional calculations using Rosetta [22] , STATIUM [24] , and molecular dynamics calculations [23] , as well as antibody developability estimates via the Therapeutic Antibody Profiler [25] (see Methods section). While all in silico calculations performed were used to select our 20 first round antibodies, the molecular mechanics/generalized Born solvent accessible surface area (MM/GBSA) molecular dynamics calculations [23] , described in the Methods section, are considered to be our most accurate estimate. MM/GBSA calculates antibody/antigen interaction free energies using fully solvated molecular dynamics (MD) for conformational sampling of the protein complex, but estimates free energy by a computationally less expensive implicit solvent model (GBSA). M396, our starting template for design, is known to neutralize SARS-CoV-1 by binding its RBD and preventing the virus from binding and entering the human ACE2 receptor; our MM/GBSA calculations for M396 in complex with the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein yield -52.2 kcal/mole (\u00b17.2).

We performed this work using just the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and previously published neutralizing antibody structures for SARS-CoV-1. Our predicted structures of SARS-CoV-2 proved to be accurate within the targeted RBD region when compared to experimentally derived structures published weeks later. With our predicted SARS-CoV-2 structures, we used our in silico design platform to evaluate 89,263 mutant antibodies by iteratively proposing mutations to SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies to optimize binding within the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We selected 20 initial antibody sequences predicted to target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Starting from a baseline free energy of -48.1 kcal/mol (\u00b1 8.3), our 20 selected first round antibody structures are predicted to have improved interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with free energies ranging as low as -82.0 kcal/mole. The baseline SARS-CoV-1 antibody in complex with the SARS-CoV-1 RBD has a calculated free energy of -52.2 kcal/mole and neutralizes the virus by preventing it from binding and entering the human ACE2 receptor. These results suggest that our predicted antibody mutants may bind the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and therefore potentially neutralize the virus.

To assess regions of sequencestructure conservation or variability between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (sequence similarity=71%), we created a set of initial structural models using available templates. The comparative analysis between constructed models and all available templates from PDB was performed using the StralSV algorithm [28] , which identifies protein fragments that exhibit structural similarities despite low primary amino acid sequence similarity and regions where some structure conformation uncertainties can be observed.

This process was followed by up to 50 iterations of the \"RepairPDB\" function in FoldX. We performed ddG calculations on the defined list of mutations using the \"BuildMODEL\" procedure, which estimates stability (dg) defined by the free energy of a protein. We used up to 46 runs in this procedure to check if calculated rotamers of specified mutations converged to the optimal or trapped solution. A first set of our ddG estimates was calculated as a difference in free energy (dg) between the mutant and wild-type (labeled \"FoldX ddG Average\" in Supplementary Materials). Additional ddG estimates were calculated using the \"AnalyseComplex\" algorithm for which we used the wild-type and mutated models to calculate ddG based on energy changes in interface only within RBD-FAB complexes (labeled \"FoldX ddG Interface\" in Supplementary Materials).",

In these structures, we calculated ddG estimates as change of stability using the \"ddg_monomer\" algorithm with 50 iterations and settings as described in [32] (labeled \"Rosetta ddG Total Energy\" in Supplementary Materials). Additional ddG estimates were calculated using the \"Flex_ddG\" protocol [33] , which evaluates energy changes by focusing on interfaces within RBD-FAB complexes only (labeled \"Rosetta ddG Flex\" in Supplementary Materials). In addition, Rosetta calculations (Total Energy and Flex) were performed for all possible single-point mutations for each of the 31 locations selected for mutation (19 amino acid mutation possibilities *31 locations = 589 total Rosetta single-point mutation calculations).",

All molecular dynamics simulations were performed with OpenMM [34] , a toolkit for molecular simulation, using the AMBER force field [35] . Positional constraints (1 kcal/mole*\u00c5 2 ) were place on the backbone atoms (C, N, and CA) during heating of the system. The system was heated in 50 K increments for 100 ps at each temperature. Once the system was at 310 K, all constraints were removed and equilibration was performed for 9 ns. Ten individual 5 ns dynamics simulations were performed from the equilibrated system for conformational sampling. The last 1 ns of the dynamics in 50 ps increments from each of the simulations was used for the MM/GBSA calculation (200 total structures). The MM/GBSA calculations were performed using MMPBSA.py that is part of the AMBER suite of programs.",

The last 4,462 mutants proposed, shown in blue, resulted in a distribution of mutants with much lower energies (more favorable FAB-RDB interaction), indicating that the machine learning model was effective in searching the combinatorial space of possible antibody mutants to identify increasingly improved predicted antibody designs. Note that FoldX Interface calculations were a major driver of the objective function for optimization, and therefore show the most improvement.",
