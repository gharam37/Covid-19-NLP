More than 9,00,000 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and more than 47,000 COVID-19-associated mortalities have been reported worldwide till the writing of this article, and these numbers are increasing every passing hour. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the SARS-CoV-2 spread as a global public health emergency and admitted that the COVID-19 is a pandemic now. The multiple sequence alignment data correlated with the already published reports on the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and indicated that this virus is closely related to the bat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-like coronavirus (bat SARS-like CoV) and the well-studied Human SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV). The disordered regions in viral proteins are associated with the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Therefore, in this study, we have exploited a set of complementary computational approaches to examine the dark proteomes of SARS-CoV-2, bat SARS-like, and human SARS CoVs by analysing the prevalence of intrinsic disorder in their proteins. According to our findings, SARS-CoV-2 proteome contains very significant levels of structural order. In fact, except for Nucleocapsid, Nsp8, and ORF6, the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are mostly ordered proteins containing author/funder. All rights reserved.

For example, cleavage sites in its replicase 1ab polyprotein are found to be highly disordered, and almost all SARS-CoV-2 proteins were shown to contain molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which are intrinsic disorder-based protein-protein interaction sites that are commonly utilized by proteins for interaction with specific partners. The results of our extensive investigation of the dark side of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome will have important implications for the structural and non-structural biology of SARS or SARS-like coronaviruses.",

In classical structure-function-paradigm, it is believed that a unique, stable, and well-defined 3-dimensional structure is a prerequisite for a protein to accomplish its unique biological function. Although this notion dominated scientific minds for over the hundred years, eventually an idea of the presence of functional intrinsic disorder in proteins came to the attention of the structural biologists. According to this \"heretic\" viewpoint, a noticeable amount of biologically active proteins (of protein regions) fail to fold into the well-defined structures and instead remain disordered, existing as highly dynamic ensembles of rapidly interconverting conformations under the physiological conditions. These proteins and protein regions are known now as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs), respectively. The propensity of being functional intrinsically disordered proteins (similar to the propensity of forming unique biologically active structures of ordered proteins) is determined by the amino acid sequences [11] [12] [13] . IDPs exhibit their biological functions in numerous biological processes commonly associated with cellular signalling, gene regulation, and control by interacting with their physiological partners [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . These functions of IDPs and IDPs are regulated by their protein-protein, protein-RNA, protein-DNA interactions [19, 20] . Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are the regions in IDPs implicated in regulation of IDPs function by protein-protein interactions and serve as the primary stage in molecular recognition. and DISOPRED3 [42] . The protein residues with ANCHOR, MoRFPred, and DISOPRED3 score above the threshold value of 0.5 and MoRFchibi_web score above the threshold value of 0.725 are considered MoRF regions.",

This helped in retrieving more detailed characterization of the global disorder predisposition of the query proteins and their classification according to the disorder \"favours\". The CH plot is a linear classifier that differentiates between proteins that are predisposed to possess extended disordered conformations that include random coils and premolten globules from proteins that have compact conformations (ordered proteins and molten globule-like proteins). The other binary predictor, CDF is a nonlinear classifier that uses the PONDR \u00ae VLXT scores to discriminate ordered globular proteins from all disordered conformations, which include native molten globules, pre-molten globules, and random coils. The CH-CDF plot can be divided into four quadrants: Q1 (bottom right quadrant) is an area of CH-CDF phase space that is expected to include ordered proteins; Q2 (bottom left quadrant) includes proteins predicted to be disordered by CDF and compact by CH (i.e., native molten globules and hybrid proteins containing high levels of both ordered and disordered regions); Q3 (top left quadrant) contains proteins that are predicted to be disordered by both CH and CDF analysis (i.e., highly disordered proteins with the extended disorder); and Q4 (top right quadrant) possesses proteins disordered according to CH but ordered according to CDF analysis [34] . Figures 2D, 2E and 2F represent the CH-CDF analysis of proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV and show that all the proteins are located within the two quadrants Q1 and Q2. The CH-CDF analysis leads to the conclusion that all proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are ordered except Nucleocapsid protein, which is predicted to be disordered by CDF but ordered by CH and hence lies in Q2.",

In this study, we have analyzed and compared MoRFs (protein-binding regions) in SARS-CoV-2 with Human SARS and Bat CoV. The results of this analysis are summarized in Table 2 , which clearly shows that most of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins contain at least one MoRF, indicating that disorder does play an important role in the functionality of these viral proteins. All of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been predicted to contain MoRFs except ORF7b and Nsp13 proteins for which none of the predictors have located any MoRF. MoRFs in Human SARS and Bat CoV proteomes are listed in Supplementary Tables 7 and 8 . Similar to SARS-CoV-2 proteome, Bat CoV proteins ORF7b, and Nsp13 were not predicted to have any MoRF by any of the servers used. In Human SARS proteome the proteins ORF7b, Nsp13, Nsp2, and Nsp15 proteins does not show the presence of any MoRF.

            "text": "MSA analysis among all three coronaviruses demonstrates that S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a 77.71% sequence identity with Bat CoV and 77.14% identity with Human SARS (Supplementary Figure S1A) . All three S proteins are found to have a conserved C-terminal region. However, the N-terminal regions of S proteins display noticeable differences. Given that there is significant sequence variation RBD located at the N-terminal region of S protein, this might be the reason behind variation in its virulence and its receptor-mediated binding and entry into the host cell. According to our intrinsic disorder propensity analysis, S protein from all three CoVs analysed in this study are highly structured, as their predicted disorder propensity lies below 10% ( Table 1 ). In fact, the mean PPID scores of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV are calculated to be 1.41%, 1.12%, and 1.85%, respectively. Figures 3B, 3C , and 3D represent the intrinsic disorder profiles of S proteins from SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS and Bat CoV obtained from six disorder predictors. Finally, Figure 3E shows aligned disorder profiles of S proteins from these CoVs and illustrates remarkable similarity in their disorder propensity, especially in the C-terminal region. It is of interest to map known functional regions of S proteins to their corresponding disorder profiles. The maturation of S protein requires specific posttranslational modification (PTM), proteolytic cleavage that happens at two stages. First, host cell furin or another cellular protease nicks the S precursor to generate S1 and S2 proteins, whereas the second cleavage that takes place after the viral attachment to host cell receptors leads to the release of a fusion peptide generating the S2' subunit. In Human SARS CoV, the first and second cleavage site is located at residues R 667 and R 797 , respectively, whereas in Bat CoV, the corresponding cleavage sites are residues R 654 and R 784 . As it follows from Figure 3 , these cleavage sites are located within the IDPRs. In Human SARS CoV S protein, fusion peptide (residues 770-788) is located within a flexible region, is characterized by the mean disorder score of 0.232\u00b10.053. Similarly, in Bat CoV S protein, fusion peptide (residues 757-775) has a mean disorder score of 0.320\u00b10.046. S protein contains two heptad repeat regions that form coiledcoil structure during viral and target cell membrane fusion, assuming a trimer-of-hairpins structure needed for the functional positioning of the fusion peptide. In Human SARS CoV S protein, heptad repeat regions are formed by residues 902-952 and 1145-1184, which have mean disorder scores of 0.458\u00b10.067 and 0.353\u00b10.062, respectively. The analogous situation is observed for the S protein from Bat CoV, where these heptad repeat regions are positioned at residues 889-939 (0.44\u00b10.11) and 1132-1171 (0.353\u00b10.062). Another functional region found in S proteins is the receptor-binding domain (residues 306-527 and 310-514 in Human SARS CoV and Bat CoV, respectively) containing a receptor-binding motif responsible for interaction with human ACE2. In human S protein of Human SARS CoV this motif (residues 424-494) is not only characterized by structural flexibility, possessing a mean disorder score author/funder. All rights reserved.

These results indicating that intrinsic disorder is important for its interaction with binding partners. Interestingly, the N-terminal region of S protein (residues 1-10) from all three viruses are observed to be a disorder-based protein binding region by two predictors (MoRFPred and DISOPRED3). N-terminal MoRF displays its role in viral interaction with host receptor and C-terminal MoRF displays its role in M protein interaction and viral assembly. Moreover, MoRF region mainly lies in the N-and C-terminal regions suggesting a possible role during cleavage as well. In addition to protein-binding regions, S protein also shows many nucleotide-binding residues. Tables 9, 10, and 11 shows that numerous RNA binding residues predicted by PPRint in all three viruses and a single RNA binding residue were predicted by DisoRDPbind in human SARS. Further, DRNApred and DisoRDPbind predicted the presence of many DNA binding residues in S protein of all three viruses. These results signify the role of S protein functions related to molecular recognition (protein-protein interaction, RNA binding, and DNA binding) such as interaction with host cell membrane and further viral infection.

Bat CoV shares 100% sequence identity with Human SARS. Mean PPID calculated for SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV E proteins are 5.33%, 6.58%, and 6.58% respectively ( Table 1) . The E protein is found to have a reasonably well-predicted structure. Our predictions suggest that the residues of N-and C-terminals are displaying a higher tendency for the disorder. The last 18 hydrophilic residues (residues 59-76) have been reported to adopt a random-coil conformation with and without the addition of lipid membranes [64] . Literature suggests that the last four amino acids of the C-terminal region of E protein containing a PZD-binding motif are involved in protein-protein interactions with a tight junction protein PALS1. Our results support literature as we identified long N-terminal region of approximately 30 residues long as disorder-based protein binding region in all three viruses (see Table 2, Supplementary Table 7 and 8). PALS1 is involved in maintaining the polarity of epithelial cells in mammals [65] . Respective graphs in Figures 4C, 4D , and 4E show the predicted intrinsic disorder profiles for E proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV.

It gains high-mannose N-glycans in ER, which are subsequently modified into complex N-glycans in the Golgi complex. Glycosylation of M protein is observed to be not essential for virion fusion in cell culture [70, 71] . Cryo-EM and Tomography data indicate that M forms two distinct conformations, a compact M protein having high flexibility and low spike density, and an elongated M protein having a rigid structure and narrow range of membrane curvature [72] . Some regions of M glycoproteins might serve as important dominant immunogens. Although no structural information is available for the full-length M protein as of yet, a short peptide of the membrane glycoprotein (residues 88-96) from Human SARS CoV was co-crystallized with a complex between A-2 alpha chain of the HLA class I histocompatibility antigen and \u03b22microglobulin (PDB ID: 3I6G) [73] .

Graphs in Figures 6C, 6D , and 6E depict the disorder profiles of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV nucleocapsid proteins and show that their N-and C-terminal regions are completely disordered, and all three proteins also contain the central unstructured segment. As expected, the intrinsic disorder predisposition of the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably similar to that for the N protein of Human SARS CoV as reported in a previous study [74] . This is further supported by Figure 6F , where PONDR \u00ae VSL2-generated disorder profiles of these three proteins are overlapped to show almost complete coincidence of their major disorder-related features. It is clear that in N-proteins, the N-and C-termini and a log central segment are completely disordered. Figure  6C shows that in the N protein from SARS-CoV-2, residues 1-57, 64-102, 145-162, 166-289, and 362-422 are found to be disordered. Many of these residues are lying within the NTD and CTD regions, and which, due to their structural plasticity, were not crystallized in Human SARS CoV N protein.

Overall, all three N proteins are found to be highly disordered.",

Similarly, in N protein from Bat CoV, S 176 is phosphorylated, and this protein has Ser-rich, Poly-Leu, and Ploy-Lys regions (residues 176-206, 219-224, and 369-375, respectively), all of which are disordered. It has been reported to interact using the central disordered region with M protein, hnRNP A1, and self N-N interaction [82] [83] [84] . The middle flexible region is also responsible for its RNA-binding activity [85] . Deletion of 184-196 residues, 169-308 residues, 161-210 residues of N abolishes its multimerization, RNAbinding capacity, and hnRNP A1 interactions respectively. Supplementary Table 7 and 8, and Table 2 shows that N protein is heavily decorated with numerous MoRFs, suggesting that this protein is a promiscuous binder. Long disorder-based protein bonding regions at Nand C-terminus of N protein of all three viruses were observed by all four predictors (MoRFchibi_web, ANCHOR, MoRFPred, and DISOPRED3). Indeed, this is the single protein where we found many MoRFs as compared with the other structural, non-structural and accessory proteins of CoVs. The MoRFs present in these regions may mediate the abovementioned interactions of N proteins. Figure 6A2 represents another important disorderrelated functional feature of the N protein. In fact, the CTD homodimer shown there is characterized by highly intertwined morphology, which is typically a result of bindinginduced folding [86] [87] [88] , indicating that a very significant part of CTD gains structure during dimerization. We identified numerous RNA binding residues in all three viruses using PPRint server. This finding supports the function of N protein as it interacts with genomic RNA for a ribonucleoprotein core formation which is crucial step for RNA encapsidation during viral particle assembly. In addition, DRNApred and DisoRDPbind predicts multiple DNA binding residues for N protein in SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV. The long flexible (IDPRs) regions at N and C-terminus of SARS-CoV-2 have long protein-binding as well as nucleotide-binding regions that may have important role in its interaction with viral RNA. author/funder.

Graphs in Figures 7A, 7B , and 7C depict the propensity for disorder in ORF3a proteins of novel SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV (SARS-like), respectively. Mean PPIDs in these ORF3a proteins are 9.1% (SARS-CoV-2), 8.8% (Human SARS), and 6.2% (Bat CoV (SARS-like)). ORF3a of SARS CoV-2 shows protein-binding regions at its N-terminus (by MoRFchibi_web (residues 1-6), MoRFPred (residues 7-12), and DISOPRED3 (residues [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] ) and at C-terminus (by MoRFchibi_web (residues 261-268) and MoRFPred (residues 259-263)) ( Table 2) . Similarly, ORF3a of Human SARS and Bat CoV also shows MoRFs at N-and C-terminus with the help of MoRFchibi_web and MoRFPred ( Supplementary Tables 7 and 8) . These protein-binding regions in ORF3a may have role in its co-localization with E, M, and S viral proteins. Apart from MoRFs, it also displays several nucleotide-binding residues in all three viruses (see Supplementary Tables 9, 10, and 11). In fact, this represents maximum number of RNA and DNA binding residues as compared with all other accessory proteins. These results indicate that the IDPs/IDPRs of this protein could be utilized in molecular recognition (protein-protein, protein-RNA, and protein-DNA interaction).",

ORF6 is a short coronavirus protein with just 63 residues. Also known as P6, this membrane-associated protein serves as an interferon (IFN) antagonist [102] . It downregulates the IFN pathway by blocking a nuclear import protein, karyopherin \u03b12. Using its C-terminal residues, ORF6 disrupts karyopherin import complex in the cytosol and, therefore, hampers the movement of transcription factors like STAT1 into the nucleus [102, 103] . It contains a YSEL motif near its C-terminal region, which functions in protein internalization from the plasma membrane into the endosomal vesicles [104] . Another study has also demonstrated the presence of ORF6 in endosomal/lysosomal compartments [104, 105] .",

Graphs in Figures 9A, 9B and 9C illustrate that ORF6 proteins from all three studied coronaviruses are expected to be moderately disordered proteins with the high disorder content in their C-terminal regions. These disordered regions are important for the biological activities of ORF6. As aforementioned, this hydrophilic region contains lysosomal targeting motif (YSEL) and diacidic motif (DDEE) responsible for binding and recognition during translocation [104] . However, the N-terminal region does not contain a noticeable disorder. The 1-38 residues of the N-terminal region of Human SARS CoV ORF6 was shown to be \u03b1-helical and embedded in the membrane, although ORF6 is not a transmembrane protein [106] . A long MoRF region ((residues 26-61 in SARS-CoV-2), (residues 31-63 in Human SARS), and (residues 30-60 in Bat Cov)) is also present at Cterminus of ORF6 proteins which are tabulated in Table 2 , and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8. No predictor other than MoRFchibi_web has located MoRFs in this protein. Supplementary Table 9 , 10, and 11 shows nucleotide-binding residues in ORF6 of all three viruses. It represents very few RNA binding residues by PPRint and few DNA binding residues by DRNApred.",

In another study, overexpression of BCL-XL in 293T cells blocked the ORF7a mediated apoptosis [111] . On the other hand, ORF7b is an integral membrane protein that has been shown to localize in the Golgi complex [112, 113] . The same reports also confirm the role of ORF7b as an accessory as well as a structural protein in SARS-CoV virion [112, 113] . Figure 10D represents the 1.8 \u00c5 X-ray crystal structure of the 14-96 fragment of the ORF7a from Human SARS CoV (PDB ID: 1XAK) and demonstrates the compact seven-stranded topology of this protein, which is similar to that of the Ig-superfamily members [114] . Importantly, in this crystal structure, residues 82-96 constituted the region with missing electron density, indicating high structural flexibility of this segment. In line with this hypothesis, the NMR solution structure of the 16-99 fragment of the ORF7a from Human SARS CoV (PDB ID: 1YO4) showed that residues 81-99 are highly disordered [115] . At the domain level, the structure of the ORF7a protein includes a signal peptide, a luminal domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail at the C-terminus [95, 114] . We found that 121-residue-long ORF7a protein of SARS-CoV-2 shares 89.26% and 85.95% sequence identity with ORF7a proteins of Bat CoV and Human SARS CoV, respectively ( Figure 10E) .

At the N-terminus, we observed one MoRF region (residues 1-10) with the help of DISOPRED3 in all three viruses. In addition to protein binding regions, ORF7a also contains several RNA and DNA binding residues. Analysis also represents, ORF7b proteins from all three viruses have low disorder content, likewise, they are not predicted to contain any MoRF by any of the predictors used in this study ( Table 2, Supplementary  Table 7 and 8). Although the ORF7b does not contain protein-binding regions, it was found to contain nucleotide (RNS and DNA) binding regions in the protein Figures 11A, 11B , and 11C depict the residues predisposed for disorder in ORF7b proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV, respectively.

Furthermore, Figures 12A and 12B show that there is no intrinsic disorder in both ORF8 proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and Bat CoV. Therefore, these two proteins predicted to be completely structured having a mean PPID of 0.00%. In ORF8a and ORF8b proteins of the Human SARS, the predicted disorder is estimated to be 2.56% and 2.38%, respectively (Table 1) . Graphs in Figures 13A and 13B illustrate the presence of some disorder near the N-and C-terminals of ORF8a and ORF8b proteins. Table 2 shows the identified MoRF regions in ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2. It shows three MoRF regions (residues 1-5, 26-52, and 69-91) by MoRFchibi_web and one MoRF region (residues 1-10) by DISOPRED3. In Human SARS, the N-terminus of both ORF8a (residues 1-39) and ORF8b (residues 1-83) was found to be MoRF by MoRFchibi_web server (Supplementary Table 7) . Further, four proteinbinding regions (residues 26-53, 70-91, 98-104, and 113-130) were identified by MoRFchibi_web server in Bat CoV (Supplementary Table 8 ). Apart from protein-binding, ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2, ORF8a and ORF8b of Human SARS, and ORF8 of Bat CoV also comprise several nucleotide-binding residues (see Supplementary Table 9 , 10, and 11).",

Based on the sequence availability of accession ID NC_045512.2, the translated protein sequence of ORF9b is not reported for the SARS-CoV-2 as of yet. However, based on the report by Wu and colleagues [45] , the sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 are already annotated. Therefore, we took the corresponding amino acid sequences from that study and conducted the intrinsic disorder analysis. According to the MSA, results shown in Figure 14E , ORF9b protein from SARS-CoV-2 shares 73.2% identity with Human SARS and 74.23% identity with Bat CoV. Our IDP analysis ( Table 1) shows that ORF9b from Human SARS is a moderately unstructured protein with a mean PPID estimated to 26.53%. As depicted in Figure 14A , 14B, and 14C, disorder mainly lies near the N-terminal end 1-10 residues and 28-40 residues near the central region with a well-ordered inner core of Human SARS ORF9b protein. The x-ray crystal structure of ORF9b has a missing electron density of the first 8 residues and 26-37 residues near the central region. This indicates that the corresponding regions are disordered, which are difficult to crystallize due to their highly dynamic structural organization.

Based on the mean PPID scores in Table 3 , Figures 17A, 17B, 17C , and taking into PPID based classification [46] , we conclude that none of the Nsps in SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV are highly disordered. The highest disorder was observed for Nsp8 proteins in all three Coronaviruses. Both Nsp1 and Nsp8 are moderately disordered proteins (10% \u2264 PPID \u2264 30%). We also observed that Nsp2, Nsp3, Nsp5, Nsp6, Nsp7, Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp15, and Nsp16 have less than 10% disordered residues and hence, belong to the category of mostly ordered proteins. Other non-structural proteins, namely, Nsp4, Nsp12, Nsp13, and Nsp14 have negligible levels of disorder (PPID < 1%), which tells us that these are highly structured proteins.",

Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nsp3 are cleaved using a viral papain-like proteinase (Nsp3/PL-Pro), while the rest of Nsps are cleaved by another viral 3C-like proteinase, Nsp5/3CL-Pro. We mapped the cleavage sites of the replicase 1ab polyprotein from Human SARS CoV to the disorder profile of this polyprotein. Figure 18 represents the results of this analysis by showing zoomed-in regions surrounding all the cleavage sites with few residues spanning at both terminals. Interestingly, we observed that all the cleavage sites are largely disordered, suggesting that intrinsic disorder may have a crucial role in the maturation of individual non-structural proteins. As the Nsps of Human SARS CoV are evolutionary close to the Nsps of SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesize that the cleavage sites in the SARS-CoV-2 replicase 1ab polyprotein are also intrinsically disordered or flexible.

Mean PPIDs of Nsp1s from SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV are 12.78%, 14.44%, and 12.85%, respectively. Figure  19A , 19B, and 19C represent the graphs of predicted per-residue intrinsic disorder propensity of these Nsp1s.

NMR solution structure of Nsp1 from Human SARS revealed the presence of two unstructured segments near the N-terminal (1-12 residues) and C-terminal (129-179 residues) regions [125] . The disordered region residues) at C-terminus is important for Nsp1 expression [126] . Based on sequence homology with Human SARS CoV Nsp1, the predicted disordered C-terminal region of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 may play a critical role in its expression. Alanine mutants at K164 and H165 in the Cterminal region of Nsp1 protein is reported to abolish its binding with the 40S subunit of the host ribosome [127] .

This protein functions by disrupting the host survival pathway via interaction with the host proteins Prohibitin-1 and Prohibitin-2 [128] . Reverse genetic deletion in the coding sequence of Nsp2 of the SARS virus attenuated little viral growth and replication and allowed the recovery of mutant virulent viruses. This indicates the dispensable nature of the Nsp2 protein for SARS viruses [129] . The sequence identity of the Nsp2 protein from SARS-CoV-2 with Nsp2s of Human SARS CoV and Bat CoV amounts to 68.34% and 68.97%, respectively (Supplementary Figure  S2A) . We have estimated the mean PPIDs of Nsp2s of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV to be 5.17%, 2.04%, and 2.03% respectively (see Table 3 ).

The First 112 residues in Nsp3 represent a ubiquitin-like globular fold while 113-183 residues form the flexible acidic domain rich in glutamic acid. It is thought to bind and ubiquitinate viral E protein using the N-terminal acidic domain [132, 133] . This unstructured segment has many MoRFs predicted by ANCHOR and MoRFPred servers which may facilitate the protein-protein interaction ( Table 2) .

It localizes itself in ERmembrane, when expressed alone but is demonstrated to be present in replication units in infected cells. It was observed that Nsp4 protein contains a tetraspanning transmembrane region having its N-and C-terminals in the cytosol [137] . No crystal or NMR solution structure is reported for this protein as of yet. Nsp4 protein of SARS-CoV-2 has multiple substitutions near the N-terminal region and has a quite conserved C-terminus (Supplementary Figure S2C) . It is found to be closer to Nsp4 of Bat CoV (81.40% identity) than to Human SARS Nsp4 (80%). Mean PPIDs of Nsp4s from SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are estimated to be 0.80%, 0.60%, and 0.60% respectively. The low level of intrinsic disorder is further illustrated by Figures 22A, 22B , and 22C. With PPIDs around zero, Nsp4 were classified as highly structured proteins, which, however, contain some flexible regions. Likewise, Table 2 shows the presence of only Nand C-terminal MoRFs which possibly assist in cleavage of Nsp4 protein from long polyproteins 1a and 1ab.",

Another crystal structure resolved to 1.96 \u00c5 revealed a chymotrypsin-like fold and a conserved substrate-binding site connected to a novel \u03b1-helical fold [140] . Recently, the X-ray crystal structure (resolution 2.16 \u00c5) was solved for the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 in complex with an inhibitor N3 (PDB ID: 6LU7) (Figure 23E ). Nsp5 protein is found to be highly conserved in all three studied CoV viruses. SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 shares a 96.08% sequence identity with Human SARS Nsp5 and 95.42% with Nsp5 of Bat CoV (Supplementary Figure S2D) . Therefore, it not surprising that our analysis demonstrated the identical mean PPID values of 1.96% for Nsp5s from SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV ( Table 3) . The predicted per-residue intrinsic disorder propensity of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV Nsp5s are presented in Figures  23A, 23B , and 23C, respectively. As the graphs depict, Nsp5s have several flexible regions and N-terminally IDPR of six residues. Due to the low flexibility of this protein, a single MoRF predicted by MoRFchibi_web is present in the N-terminal region (residues 3-8) in Nsp5s of all three viruses (Table 2, Supplementary Tables 7 and 8) . Further, the identified nucleotide-binding residues in Nsp5 of all three viruses are tabulated in Supplementary  Tables 9, 10, and 11 .",

Nsp9 protein is a single-stranded RNA-binding protein [145] . It might protect RNA from nucleases by binding and stabilizing viral nucleic acids during replication or transcription [145] . Our results on nucleotide-binding tendency of Nsp9 shows the presence of several RNA binding and few DNA binding residues in Nsp9 of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV (Supplementary Tables 9, 10, and 11) . Presumed to evolve from a protease, Nsp9 forms a dimer using its GXXXG motif [146, 147] . Figure 27D shows a 2.7 \u00c5 crystal structure of the homodimer of Human SARS Nsp9 (PDB ID: 1QZ8) that identified a unique and previously unreported for other proteins, oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide fold-like fold [145] . Here, each monomer contains a coneshaped \u03b2-barrel and a C-terminal \u03b1-helix arranged into a compact domain [145] . Nsp9 of SARS-CoV-2 is equally similar to Nsp9s from both Human SARS and Bat CoV, having a percentage identity of 97.35%. The difference in three amino acids at 34, 35 and 48 positions accounts for these similarity scores ( Figure 27E ). As calculated, the mean PPIDs of Nsp9s of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV are 7.08%, 7.96%, and 7.08% respectively. Figures 27A, 27B , and 27C depict the predicted intrinsic disorder propensity in the Nsp9 protein from SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV.

Nsp9 contains conserved residues (R10, K52, Y53, R55, R74, F75, K86, Y87, F90, K92, R99, and R111) of positively charged side chains suitable for binding with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of RNA and aromatic side-chain amino acids providing stacking interactions [145] . author/funder.

Nsp14 is a multifunctional viral protein that acts as an Exoribonuclease (ExoN) and methyltransferase (N7-MTase) in SARS coronaviruses. It's 3' to 5' exonuclease activity lies in the conserved DEDD residues related to exonuclease superfamily [154] . Its guanine-N7 methyltransferase activity depends upon the S-adenosyl-Lmethionine (AdoMet) as a cofactor [149] . As aforementioned, Nsp14 requires Nsp10 for activating its ExoN and N7-MTase activity inside the host cells. Figure 28D depicts the 3.2 \u00c5 crystal structure of human SARS nsp10/nsp14 complex (PDB ID: 5C8T), where amino acids 1-287 form the ExoN domain and 288-527 residues form the N7-MTase domain of nsp14. A loop (residues 288-301) is essential for its N7-MTase activity [150] . SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 protein shares a 95.07% identity with Human SARS Nsp14 and 94.69% with Bat CoV Nsp14 (Supplementary Figure S2G) . Mean PPID values for Nsp14s from SARS-CoV-2 and Human SARS is calculated to be 0.38%, while the Nsp14 from Bat CoV has a mean PPID 0.57%. Predicted per-residue intrinsic disorder propensity of Nsp14s from SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV is represented in Figures 31A, 31B , and 31C, respectively. As can be observed from these plots and corresponding PPID values, all Nsp14s are found to be highly structured. Likewise, Table 2 shows Nsp14 contains two protein binding regions (residues 8-13 and 441-445) predicted by the MoRFPred server in all three viruses. As shown in Supplementary Tables 9, 10, and 11, the ORF14 represents multiple nucleotide-binding residues.",

Nsp16 protein is another MTase domain-containing protein. As methylation of coronavirus mRNAs occurs in steps, three proteins Nsp10, Nsp14, and Nsp16 acts one after another. The first event requires the initiation trigger from Nsp10 protein, after which Nsp14 methylates capped mRNAs forming cap-0 (7Me) GpppA-RNAs. Nsp16 protein, along with its co-activator protein Nsp10, acts on cap-0 (7Me) GpppA-RNAs to give rise to final cap-1 (7Me)GpppA(2'OMe)-RNAs [149, 157] .

This small protein with unknown function requires experimental insights to further characterize this protein. The intrinsic disorder predicting software used in this study requires amino acid sequences, which are at least 30-residue long. Therefore, because of their short sequences (just 13 residues) Nsp11s from all three studied coronaviruses were not checked for the intrinsic disorder, disorder-based protein binding regions, and nucleotide-binding residues. Based on the MSA outputs, Nsp11 from SARS-CoV-2 was found to have a sequence identity of 84.62% with Nsp11s from Human SARS and Bat CoV (Figure 34 ). ",

Despite its pandemic nature, there is very little information available in the public domain regarding the structures and functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Based on its similarity with Human SARS CoV and Bat CoV, the published reports have suggested the functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. In this study, we utilized information available on SARS-CoV-2 genome and translated proteome from GenBank, and carried out a comprehensive computational analysis of the prevalence of the intrinsic disorder in SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Additionally, a comparison was also made with proteins from close relatives of SARS-CoV-2 from the same group of beta coronaviruses, Human SARS CoV and Bat CoV. Our analysis revealed that in these three CoVs, the N proteins are highly disordered, possessing the PPID values of more than 60%. These viruses also have several moderately disordered proteins, such as Nsp8, Orf6, and Orf9b. Although other proteins have shown lower disorder content, almost all of them contain at least some IDPRs, and all CoV proteins author/funder. All rights reserved.

Importantly, our study provides novel information on presence of intrinsic disorder at the cleavage sites of the replicase 1ab polyprotein of CoVs. This observation confirms the crucial role of IDPRs in maturation of individual proteins. We also established that many of these proteins contain disorder-based binding motifs. Since IDPs/IDPRs might undergo structural transition upon association with their physiological partners, our study generates important grounds for better understanding of the functionality of these proteins, their interactions with other viral proteins, as well as interaction with host proteins in different physiological conditions. This will also guide structural biologists to carry out a structure-based analysis of SARS-CoV-2 proteome to explore the path for the development of new drugs and vaccines.",

            "text": "The periodical outbreaks of pathogens worldwide always remind the lack of suitable drugs or vaccines for proper cure or treatment. In 2003, nearly 750 deaths were reported due to the SARS outbreak in more than 24 countries. But this time, the outbreak of Wuhan's novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has quickly surpassed this number, indicating more causalities soon. The lack of accurate information and ignorance of primary symptoms are major reasons, which cause many infection cases. Although efficient transmission from human to human is confirmed, the actual reasons for fast SARS-CoV-2 spread are still unknown, but some assumptions were made by researchers and Chinese authorities. The fast spread of SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 pandemic, and associated introduction of quarantine also have made major impacts on economy and education worldwide due to several restrictions, such as limited transportation, restrained or frozen traveling, halted attendance of mass events, the introduction of distant teaching and learning, etc. Due to advancements in sequencing techniques, the full genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was made available in a few days of the first infection report from Wuhan, China. However, massive subsequent research needs to be done to identify the actual cause of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and to design suitable treatment in the coming future. Certain possibilities can be explored with the available information. The mutational pressure study on this virus will be very interesting to see if this virus transforms from Bat SARS to Human SARS to SARS-CoV-2. More in-depth experimental studies using molecular and cell biology techniques to establish structurefunction relationships are required for a better understanding of the functioning of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Additionally, based on the sequence homology and information on proteinprotein interactions, the associated viral and host proteins should be explored, for finding means suitable for limiting replication, maturation, and ultimately pathogenesis of this virus. Although structural biology techniques (so-called rational drug design) can be used in drug development utilizing high throughput screening of compounds virtually or experimentally, the applicability of these techniques is limited by the presence of intrinsic disorder in target proteins. Therefore, the thorough disorder analysis of three coronaviruses conducted in this study will help structural biologists to rationally design experiments keeping this information in mind. author/funder.
