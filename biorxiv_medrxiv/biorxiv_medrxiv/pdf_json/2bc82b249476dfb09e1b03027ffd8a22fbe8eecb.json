Together with the fast spread of a new pathogen, we are witnessing a relatively new phenomenon, defined as \"infodemic\" by the WHO (WHO, 2020). An \"infodemic\" represents the uncontrolled spread of false or \"exaggerated\" information (i.e. misinformation) relating to the pathogen or epidemic, which might determine an unpredictable response by the population. This response can translate into an increase in the concern of the population towards the epidemics, and even outright panic. This can also lead to public unrest or other consequences that can be difficult to control. Misinformation, like a virus itself, can be easily transmitted from person to person. The WHO has therefore highlighted that the spread of unconfirmed or incorrect information can be very dangerous for public health 1 .",

In it, authors reported that a cluster of pneumonia of unknown aetiology was published on ProMED-mail, possibly related to contact with the Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China, and warned for the potential international spread via commercial air travel. On the other hand, the communication channels of the official sources (WHO, Ministries of Health, etc.) are committed to collecting, filtering and transmitting true and confirmed information, in order to provide a public service and to contain the population response. In turn, traditional media (newspapers, periodicals, etc.), both digital and printed, resume the news and disseminate it. At this level, misinformation can occur. That is, the creation -more or less fraudulent -of false news that can determine an emotional response in the population, creating false beliefs or panic.",

For example, the sudden onset of a new virus forces the scientific community to describe the index-case, by publishing a paper in a scientific journal. Subsequently, if it deems it necessary, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of one Country can indicate the risk for people travelling to the area where the case occurred. A newspaper can later resume the news, which can be shared and commented by individual users on social media. In this framework, misinformation might be the most dangerous and contagious aspect, as underlined by the WHO. Similarly to disease outbreak analysis, a viral content on the internet can also be seen as a chain reaction. Therefore, as misinformation can be considered as a public health threat, in the early stages of a pandemic it is important to contain false information and to disseminate correct data that may come primarily from scientific studies. At the present, it is essential that methodologically solid information is disseminated, both to avoid misinformation and to spread only real world evidence, possibly through peer-reviewed articles. This despite the fact that the peer review at this stage is done less rigorously because of the emergency. It is important that the information gaps are filled, but it is also important to contrast the infodemic with solid information, news and data.",

However, traditional media and social networks resume and disseminate information in a proper or inappropriate way. Identifying the most relevant evidence produced by the scientific community and quantifying which studies and which data are shared the most in the world can help researchers and policymakers in focusing on the most relevant ones and controlling the epidemic. This can be done by capturing and measuring traditional citations of scientific papers but also through the use of innovative and alternative scientometrics tools. Scientometrics is the 1 field of study which measures and analyses scientific literature, including the measurement of the impact of research papers and the use of such measurements in policy and management contexts. Alternative metrics (a.k.a. \"altmetrics\") are gaining increasing interest in the scientometrics community as they can capture both the volume and quality of attention that a research work receives online. Altmetrics are nontraditional research impact measures that are based on web-based environments. Altmetrics measurement derives from the social web and is increasingly used as an early indicator of research impact (P. Wouters et al. 2015; J. Ravenscroft et al. 2017; L. Bornmann, R.

We placed a language restriction for English, without other limits. Furthermore, we limited the search to the following time-span: from December 1, 2019 to February 13, 2020.

In fact, each paper has different numbers for each category considered and a standardized measure is needed to fairly quantify the communicative impact. CIS represents a unifying score over heterogeneous bibliometric indicators and categories. After CIS was computed for all the retrieved papers we used the zscore for obtaining standard values and the arithmetic mean for the average. Intuitively, the z-score is a numerical measure that gives us an idea of how far from the mean a data point is.

The following statistics provide a summary of the recorded CIS values (Figure 2 ): max=5.21, min=-0.21, mean=0.02, median=-0.19. The threshold identified is t=1.04. Such a threshold is the value of the 95% quantile and allows us to record 8 out of 239 papers (Figure 1, Figure 2 ) as potentially more impactful. Lower values for t are not significant for capturing relevant works (as explained in Boetto et al. 2020 ). The resulting 8 most impactful studies' main features are described in Table 3 . Among those, 6 papers are case reports, 1 methodological study, 1 editorial. First authors come from China (n = 6), USA (n=1) and Germany (n=1). The 8 papers' main topics are: case/s description (n=5), outbreak investigation (n=2) and 1 genomic study.",
