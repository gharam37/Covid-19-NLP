The glycosylation of these surface antigens helps the pathogen evade recognition by the host immune system by cloaking the protein surface from detection by antibodies, and can influence the ability of the host to raise an effective adaptive immune response 3, 4 or even be exploited by the virus to enhance infectivity 5 . Fortunately, the innate immune system has evolved a range of strategies for responding to glycosylated pathogens 6 , but antigen glycosylation nevertheless complicates the development of vaccines 7 . Over time, the protein sequences in viral antigens undergo mutations, which can alter the species specificity of the virus 8 , modulate its infectivity 9 , and alter the antigenicity of the surface proteins 10 . These mutations can also impact the degree to which the protein is glycosylated by creating new or removing existing locations of the glycans (glycosites) on the antigens 11, 12 . Varying surface antigen glycosylation is thus a mechanism by which new virus strains can evade the host immune response 11 , and attenuate the efficacy of existing vaccines 7 .",

            "text": "The impact of glycosylation on the ability of antibodies to bind to a pathogenic glycoprotein may be estimated by quantifying the fraction of the surface area of the protein antigen that is physically shielded by glycans from antibody recognition. Such an analytical approach to defining glycoprotein antigenicity led to the conclusion that glycosylation of the E2 envelope protein of hepatitis C virus reduces its surface area by up to 65% 19 . The structure of proteins may be readily determined experimentally using techniques such as x-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), however, it is far more challenging to determine the structure of the glycans. This is because glycans are often significantly more flexible than the proteins to which they are attached, and also because multiple different glycan structures may be present at any given glycosite, giving rise to an ensemble of glycosylated protein variants (glycoforms). This glycan heterogeneity is a natural result of the mechanism of protein glycosylation. While all glycans that are added to proteins through attachment to asparagine side chains (N-linked glycans) are transferred en bloc as a single glycan precursor structure, subsequent passage of the nascent glycoprotein through the cellular machinery (Endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus) exposes the glycans to enzymes, glycosidases and glycosyl transferases, that modify their structure. The ability of enzymes to alter or process each glycan depends in part on the 3D shape of the protein to which the glycan is attached, particularly in the region of the glycosite 16, 20, 21 , and on the time that any given glycan is exposed to these enzymes 20, 22 . The presence of multiple glycosites and the variation in the composition of the glycans at a glycosite, can result in a staggering number of permutations of protein glycoforms. Although the particular structure of the glycans at the glycosites may not impact protein immunogenicity, as reported in the case of hepatitis C virus 19 , the location and number or density of glycosites can have a profound impact on the innate immune response to virus 23 and on the antigenicity of viral envelope proteins 24, 25 , as observed in the case of influenza A. Lastly, to further complicate our understanding of the effect of glycosylation on protein antigenicity, glycans display large internal motions that prevents their accurate description by any single 3D shape, in contrast to proteins 26, 27 .",

In a typical simulation, the glycans are added to the experimentally-determined 3D structure of the protein, and the resulting static model of the glycoprotein is then subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that approximate the effects of water and temperature on the temporal and spatial properties of the glycoprotein over the simulation time frame. The 3D structures obtained from the simulation can then be used to determine the extent to which glycosylation has altered the protein's antigenicity 19 or other properties. When the structure of specific glycans at particular glycosites is known, these glycans can be employed in the simulation 19, 20, 31, 32 , however this data is often unavailable and plausible glycosylation states may have to be assumed, particularly in the case of proteins with multiple permutations of glycoforms 16 .",

Because SPD requires a cluster of high mannose glycans on the pathogenic protein in order to bind 16 , variations in the glycan composition can impair such a response.

From this alignment, the extent to which epitopes in the CoV-2 S glycoprotein might be inaccessible to known antibodies on the basis of structural differences in the glycoproteins or due to shielding by glycans on the CoV-2 S glycoprotein surface (Figure 1 ) was inferred. The previously reported antibodies bind almost exclusively to the S1 RBD. When aligned on the glycosylated CoV-2 S protein, it is evident that approximately 50% of the corresponding CoV-1 or MERS epitopes are shielded by glycans from antibody binding in the CoV-2 S glycoprotein, and only areas of the protein surface at the apex of the S1 domain appear to be accessible to known antibodies. The epitope surface area in the known antibody co-complexes ranges between approximately 800 to 1000 \u00c5 2 , which is comparable to the contact surface between the S glycoprotein and its ACE2 receptor 49 .

Furthermore, the number of antibodies that have been co-crystallized with the related S proteins represents only a minute fraction of the possible repertoire. To address these limitations, we subjected multiple glycoforms of the CoV-2 S glycoprotein to MD simulation and interpreted the results in terms of the impact of glycan structure on the theoretical S glycoprotein antigenic surface area (Figure 2 ).",

This probe size may be compared to values of 5 and 10 \u00c5 employed previously to estimate antigenic surface area 19 . Changes in the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) showed no shielding by glycans and thus a simple SASA model was not useful for this analysis 19 . Additionally, to account for the presence of the beta-sheet framework in the antibody variable fragment (Fv), we introduced a second larger probe (18.6 \u00c5) sufficient to approximately enclose that domain. The antigenic surface area is then defined as sum of the surface areas of any protein residues that make contact with the CDR probe, provided that the CDR probe is proximal to residues accessible to the Fv probe. This latter requirement is governed by Lmax, which requires that the distance between the CDR-antigen contact site and the Fv probe surface be less than the length (10.4 \u00c5) of the longest CDR loop in mAb PGT128. PGT128 was chosen for this reference as it contains a particularly long CDR loop that penetrates the glycan shield of gp120. Images generated with UCSF Chimera 67 .",

A site-specific model generated from the most commonly observed glycans at each glycosite for the S glycoprotein produced recombinantly in HEK293 cells was also included for comparison. This glycoform resulted in shielding of just over 40% of the S protein antigenic surface; a value similar to the models based on uniform M9 and Complex glycans. These results are broadly consistent with the conclusion that antigenicity of the S protein is insensitive to glycan microheterogeneity, with the exception of the glycoform composed solely of M3 glycans. Nevertheless, differences in glycosylation may impact other features, such as local interactions between the glycan and the protein surface, or local structural fluctuations in either the protein or glycan conformations that are only partially captured by the CRD probe analysis. A visual examination of the structures from MD simulation (Figures 3 and S1 ) broadly confirms the observation (Figure 1 ) that the most exposed epitopes comprise the ACE2 receptor site, specifically the apex region of the S1 domain when that domain is in the open conformation. Moreover, the extensive motion displayed by each glycan illustrates that no single static model can fully capture the extent of glycan shielding. It can also be observed that a ring of antigenic sites appears to encircle the S1 domain, independent of glycoform. Unlike the extremely high level of glycan shielding in gp120 that challenges HIV vaccine development 69, 70 , the level of shielding by glycans in the S protein is more moderate, with approximately 60% of the surface potentially accessible to antibodies.

Beyond a role in shielding the underlying protein from recognition by antibodies, the glycans on pathogenic proteins may also attenuate the ability of the host immune system to raise antibodies against any epitopes that include the glycan. In a T-cell dependent adaptive immune response, peptides from the endocytosed pathogen are presented on antigen presenting cells by major histocompatibility complex II molecules, known as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complexes. HLA complexes have preferred peptide motifs, and based on a knowledge of these preferences it is possible to predict which peptides in a protein are likely to be HLA antigens 71, 72 . However, when that peptide contains a glycosylation site, the ability of the peptide to be presented in an HLA complex may be compromised, if for example the peptide cannot bind to the HLA molecule due to the steric presence of the glycan. However, glycopeptides may be presented in HLA complexes 73 if the glycan is small enough or if it is found on the end of the peptide antigen where it doesn't interfere with HLA binding 74 .

Of the 18 glycosites in the 3D structure, 16 are predicted to be present in HLA peptides. Although the glycans may occur throughout the HLA sequences (Table S2 ), in 12 of these sequences the glycans are predicted to be present at the terminus of at least one putative HLA antigen. This observation suggests that these 12 glycosites may not interfere with antigen presentation in an HLA complex. This property is essential for the potential generation of antibodies against the underlying epitopes, but moreover, may lead to antibodies that target these carbohydrates on the S glycoprotein 73 . Anti-carbohydrate antibodies have been shown to be neutralizing in other viruses, such as HIV 75 , and therefore glycosylated peptides can offer an alternative to more traditional peptide epitopes. From the perspective of vaccine development 76 , targeting glycans as epitopes would be expected to benefit from matching the glycan microheterogeneity in the vaccine to that in the circulating virus, which requires additional consideration of the choice of cell type for vaccine production.",

In contrast, by analogy with influenza hemagglutinin 33, 77 , variations in glycosite location arising from antigenic drift can be expected to have a profound effect on S protein antigenicity and potentially vaccine efficacy. Fortunately, the most accessible and largest antigenic surface in the S protein consists of the ACE2 binding domain, where the virus can't exploit glycan shielding or mutational changes to evade host immune response without potentially attenuating viral fitness.

Energy minimization of all atoms was performed for 20,000 steps (10,000 steepest decent, followed by 10,000 conjugant gradient) under constant pressure (1 atm) and temperature (300 K) (nPT) conditions. All MD simulations were performed under nPT conditions with the CUDA implementation of the PMEMD 81,82 simulation code, as present in the Amber14 software suite 83 . The GLYCAM06j force field 84 and Amber14SB force field 85 were employed for the carbohydrate and protein moieties, respectively. A Berendsen barostat with a time constant of 1 ps was employed for pressure regulation, while a Langevin thermostat with a collision frequency of 2 ps -1 was employed for temperature regulation. A nonbonded interaction cutoff of 8 \u00c5 was employed. Long-range electrostatics were treated with the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method 86 . Covalent bonds involving hydrogen were constrained with the SHAKE algorithm, allowing an integration time step of 2 fs 87 to be employed. The energy minimized coordinates were equilibrated at 300K over 400 ps with restraints on the solute heavy atoms. Each system was then equilibrated with restraints on the C\uf061 atoms of the protein for 1ns, prior to initiating 3 independent production MD simulations with random starting seeds for a total time of 0.25 \uf06ds, with no restraints applied.",
