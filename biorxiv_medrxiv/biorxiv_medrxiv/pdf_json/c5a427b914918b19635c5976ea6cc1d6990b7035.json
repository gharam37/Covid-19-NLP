            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemics has fuelled much research efforts towards repurposing of existing drugs as possible antiviral agents, whereby the therapeutic strategies have been largely based on preexisting data for the preceding coronaviral outbreaks TORS and MERS 1-3 . The drug regulatory agencies, health authorities, key opinion leaders and policy decision makers have been significantly strained by the dilemma of evidence-based medicine and good clinical practice versus the prompt need for safe and effective treatment 4 . Unfortunately we have been witnessing huge public and political pressure for legitimation of drug-repurposing and off-label use worldwide, which nonetheless could be regarded as an acceptable compromise, pending the emergency of the current situation, but only in case of drugs with well-defined safety profiles and at least some clinical evidence in COVID-19 4, 5 . Conversely most of the treatment protocols are based on observational studies and anecdotic reports 4,6-9 , albeit with a hope that the promptly emerging data from randomized studies will enable switching COVID-19 treatment back to the avenues of evidence-based medicine 10 . An exceptionally alarming phenomenon however is the public communication of drugs with preliminary in vitro activities against SARS-CoV-2 as potential therapeutics for COVID-19 eventually causing malignant reverberation in social media. Such example is the otherwise very interesting study of Caly et al., recently published in Antiviral Research 11 . This paper is describing the in vitro antiviral activity of the antiparasitic agent ivermectin in a model of Vero/hSLAM cells infected with a SARS-CoV-2 isolate (Australia/VIC01/2020) 11 . The authors have performed a pilot experiment using continuous exposure of the cells to ivermectin at 5 \u00b5mol/L and found time-dependent decrease of cell associated and supernatant viral RNA. Thereafter the antiviral activity was assessed following continuous exposure to serial dilutions of ivermectin, which caused concentration-dependent antiviral effects with practically total eradication at 5 \u00b5mol/L and halfmaximal inhibition at approximately 2.5 \u00b5mol/L 11 .",

Ivermectin affects a plethora of ivertebrate species, incl. parasitic nematodes, arachnids, and insects. Its mode of action on target species is by potentiating GABA-mediated neurotransmission and by binding to glutamategated Clchannels, found only in invertebrates 13 . The drug induces tonic paralysis of the musculature of susceptible parasites, and eventually death 13 . At the recommended doses, ivermectin does not readily penetrate the CNS of mammals, where GABA functions as a neurotransmitter 13, 15 . Conversely in healthy volunteers and infected patients the drug is usually well tolerated at the therapeutic dose ranges [12] [13] [14] . A recent meta-analysis has shown that even larger doses (up to 800 \u00b5g/kg) with a several years period of follow-up could be well tolerated in patients with parasitic infections 16 . The largest dose intensity with registered pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy subjects is 120 mg, corresponding to up to 2000 \u00b5g/kg 12 .",

Comparison between the in vitro inhibitory concentration of ivermectin 11 with exemplar published C max values of the drug 12, 17 In vitro end-points 11 Inhibitory concentrations (\u00b5mol/L) The repurposed antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine that have been included in numerous COVID-19 treatment protocols also have micromolar inhibitory concentrations against SARS-CoV-2 26 and nanomolar C max values 27 . Nevertheless these agents have enormous apparent volumes of distribution and presumably disproportionally larger tissue levels relative to the plasma concentrations, which makes the translation of the in vitro data plausible [27] [28] [29] . The other very promising agent tested in clinical trials and applied as compassionate use for COVID-19 is remdesivir 1,30 . This broad-spectrum antiviral drug originally developed for Ebola shows potent inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2 with an IC 50 of 0.77 \u00b5mol/L (464 ng/ml) 31 . This concentration is readily attainable as the drug is given as venous infusion. The typical dosing schedule for remdesivirinitial infusion of 200 mg, followed by 100 mg/daily for a total of 5 days yields maximal plasma concentrations of 5440 ng/ml in the first day and 2610 on day 5 30 .",

Nevertheless at large doses the drug could penetrate the bloodbrain barrier and could affect GABA-ergic transmission causing CNS depression and potentiation of the effects of benzodiazepines 15 . Human exposures at doses multifold higher than the therapeutic is expected to give rise to side effects similar to those documented in preclinical mammalian testing 13, 15 . Human overdoses have been associated with vomiting, tachycardia and ECG abnormalities, significant blood pressure fluctuations, CNS effects (drowsiness, ataxia) and visual disturbances (mydriasis). Accidental self-injection of a veterinary medicinal product has produced signs of clinical toxicity, albeit the drug was applied at therapeutically relevant dose (approximately 200 \u00b5g/kg) 15 .",

In Bulgaria in particular this study has prompted the National Veterinarians` Union to share their concerns about the hysteria this study has evoked and to firmly discourage self-medication with ivermectin, which in this country is only available for use in animals 39 .
