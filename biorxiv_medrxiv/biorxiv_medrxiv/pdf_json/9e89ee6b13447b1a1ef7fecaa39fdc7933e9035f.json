Using publicly available lung single-cell data, we found TRIB3 expressed mainly in alveolar epithelial cells that express SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Functional enrichment analysis of age-related genes, in common with SARS-CoV-induced perturbations, revealed genes associated with the mitotic cell cycle and surfactant metabolism. Given that TRIB3 was previously reported to decrease virus infection and replication, the decreased expression of TRIB3 in aged lungs may help explain why older male patients are related to more severe cases of the COVID-19. Thus, drugs that stimulate TRIB3 expression should be evaluated as a potential therapy for the disease.",

The conserved evolutionary relationship between the 2019 novel SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV 9 opens up the possibility to explore the relationships between these human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in public databases. Computational predictions of SARS-CoV-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs) may identify mechanisms of viral infection and drug targets [9] [10] [11] . In this context, the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database 12, 13 has provided insights into age-related genes 14, 15 and, associated with single-cell transcriptomics, could predict SARS-CoV-2-PPIs in aging lungs.

The involvement of TRIB3 in viral infection is poorly understood; however, its inhibition was associated with an increase of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication 22 . Additionally, TRIB3 negatively regulates the entry step of the HCV life cycle and propagation 22 Table S8 ). We found that genes that decrease their expression with aging and genes that are up-regulated with SARS-CoV infections generated the most significant network, with overrepresented genes associated with mitotic cell cycle and surfactant metabolism ( Figure 2 ). The decreased capacity of cellular division on aging is associated with cellular senescence -a mechanism that stops cells with damaged DNA from replicating 26 -and progenitor cell exhaustion 27 . The altered metabolism or secretion of surfactants by AT2 cells reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse in HCoVs infections 28, 29 . Moreover, Sftpc -/-(Surfactant Protein C) mice have worse viral infections than controls 30 , and its human homolog decreased with aging while it is up-regulated on SARS-CoV infections ( Figure 2 ). Thus, the pneumonia-like lung injury found on severe cases of COVID-19 infections 5,6 may be aggravated by impaired lung regeneration and altered metabolism of surfactants in older male patients.",

The expression data of each subject was distributed according to their age range: 30-39; 40-49; 50-59; 60-69 and 70-79 years old (yo), and each age range was compared with the group of young adults (20-29 yo) as a common control (Data S1, Supplementary Table S9 .

This analysis aimed at the identification of clusters with gradients of gene expression across age ranges, showing increased or decreased expression during aging (method adapted from Theunissen et al., 2011 33 ). The clusterization of gene expression profiles on female lung samples generated clusters with less evident gradients compared to the males (Figure 1a and Figure S4 ). Thus, considering the clear clusterization found in males, and the fact that older males seem to have a worse prognosis on COVID-19 6 , we focused on male profiles to identify age-related lung genes.",

TRIB3 is also one of the unfolded protein response (UPR)-related genes with the strongest positive correlation with the intracellular abundance of the flavivirus dengue and Zika 23 . Considering the need for drugs to treat COVID-19, the \u03b1 -hydroxylinoleic acid (ABTL0812) induces the expression of TRIB3 by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis and promoting autophagy cell death in cancer 24 . We highlight that the lifecycle of coronaviruses depends on several host-cell encoded cellular pathways, and among these pathways, UPR and autophagy pathways of the host cells are essential to the life cycle of coronaviruses 25 . Finally, we compared SARS-CoV-induced perturbations in host gene expression, from public Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, with our list of DEGs in GTEx lung samples during aging (Figure 2,",
