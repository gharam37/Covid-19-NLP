COVID-19 is predominantly defined by respiratory symptoms, but cardiac complications including arrhythmias, heart failure, and viral myocarditis are also prevalent. Although the systemic ischemic and inflammatory responses caused by COVID-19 can detrimentally affect cardiac function, the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human cardiomyocytes is not well-understood. We used human induced pluripotent stem cellderived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) as a model system to examine the mechanisms of cardiomyocyte-specific infection by SARS-CoV-2. Microscopy and immunofluorescence demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can enter and replicate within hiPSC-CMs, localizing at perinuclear locations within the cytoplasm. Viral cytopathic effect induced hiPSC-CM apoptosis and cessation of beating after 72 hours of infection. These studies show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect hiPSC-CMs in vitro, establishing a model for elucidating the mechanisms of infection and potentially a cardiac-specific antiviral drug screening platform.",

A recent study demonstrated significantly elevated troponin levels among some COVID-19 patients, indicating cardiac injury, and notably, cardiac injury was associated with increased risk of mortality (Shi et al., 2020a) . The etiology of cardiac injury in COVID-19, however, remains unclear. Cardiac injury may be ischemia-mediated, and the profound inflammatory and hemodynamic impacts seen in COVID-19 have been hypothesized to cause atherosclerotic plaque rupture or oxygen supply-demand mismatch resulting in ischemia (Madjid et al., 2020) . Alternatively, cardiac tissue expresses the ACE2 receptor, further suggesting feasibility of direct viral internalization in cardiomyocytes (Chen et al., 2020) . Indeed, case studies have raised suspicion for cardiac injury mediated by direct myocardial viral infection and resulting fulminant myocarditis (Hu et al., 2020; Tavazzi et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2020) . In order to gain further insights into the cardiac pathophysiology of COVID-19, it will be critical to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect isolated human cardiomyocytes in vitro.

The hiPSC-CMs express relevant proteins found in adult human CMs, can spontaneously contract, can be made in weeks using defined differentiation protocols, and can be genetically customized using genome editing (Sharma et al., 2018) . HiPSC-CMs express ACE2, which increases over 90 days of differentiation (Churko et al., 2018) . The hiPSC-CMs are also responsive to inotropic drugs such as norepinephrine, and beating rates can be controlled via electrical stimulation (Toepfer et al., 2019) . Because hiPSC-CMs can be purified and replated for downstream applications, research groups in academia and industry now utilize these cells for cardiovascular disease modeling and high-throughput drug screening assays. HiPSC-CMs can recapitulate cellular phenotypes for cardiovascular diseases including various forms of cardiomyopathy (Lan et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2012) and drug-induced cardiotoxicity (Burridge et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2017) . Notably, hiPSC-CMs have also shown promise as an in vitro model for studying the mechanisms of direct cardiomyocyte viral infection in the context of viral myocarditis. A previous study demonstrated that coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), one of the major causative agents for viral myocarditis, can rapidly infect and proliferate within hiPSC-CMs (Sharma et al., 2014) . CVB3, like SARS-CoV-2, is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, although unlike SARS-CoV-2, it does not have a viral envelope. The hiPSC-CMs produce the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor protein, which is needed for infection by CVB3.",

Notably, both the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and dsRNA intermediates localized at perinuclear regions in hiPSC-CMs ( Figure 1D , 1E), consistent with prior results with coronavirus infection in non-cardiomyocytes (Hagemeijer et al., 2012) and coxsackievirus infection on hiPSC-CMs (Sharma et al., 2014) . This suggests the presence of a viroplasm whereby hiPSC-CM ribosomal machinery and other membranous components are being co-opted for viral replication and protein translation. Quantification of stained cells demonstrated the percent of total cells that were positive for dsRNA and spike protein, as well as for cleaved caspase-3 ( Figure 1F ). Simple beat rate contractility analysis was also conducted, whereby 30 second videos were taken of wells containing mock and infected hiPSC-CMs (Supplemental Movie 1). Functionally, infected hiPSC-CMs ceased beating after 72 hours of SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas mock wells continued to contract ( Figure 1G ). Taken together, these results indicate that hiPSC-CMs are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and downstream detrimental cytopathic effects, that the SARS-CoV-2 may be able to replicate in distinct perinuclear locations within hiPSC-CMs by co-opting cellular organelles for viral protein translation, and that SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly reduces functional contractility in hiPSC-CMs.",

At an MOI of 0.1, whereby approximately 1 viral particle was introduced per 10 cells, hiPSC-CMs experienced cytopathic effect after 72 hours of infection. The virus presumably enters the cell through the ACE2 receptor, which has previously been shown to be produced in hiPSC-CMs (Churko et al., 2018) . Immunostaining of two SARS-CoV-2 components, the unique dsRNA intermediate and the \"spike\" capsid protein responsible for viral entry and virion particle assembly, demonstrates that this novel coronavirus can enter hiPSC-CMs to unleash its RNA cargo and hijack host hiPSC-CM translational machinery to produce new viral components. Notably, both the dsRNA and \"spike\" stains localized to perinuclear regions, indicative of the formation of hallmark viroplasm structures within hiPSC-CMs. The viroplasm is an inclusion body within the cytoplasm that recruits host cellular components such as ribosomes, chaperones, and mitochondria to establish a de facto viral replication factory within the cell (Netherton and Wileman, 2011) . Not only has this perinuclear viral component accumulation been reported in other in vitro coronavirus infection studies (Hagemeijer et al., 2012) , but it parallels what was seen in hiPSC-CMs infected with coxsackievirus B3 (Sharma et al., 2014) . Presumably, this increased viral load within hiPSC-CMs activated downstream apoptotic events. This was indicated by alterations in cellular morphologies and increased production of cleaved caspase-3.",

However, even in these immature cells, the current study showed overt virus-induced cardiotoxicity and physiological effects at low SARS-CoV-2 MOI. Since expression of ACE2 increases as hiPSC-CMs mature in in vitro culture (Churko et al., 2018) , one could hypothesize that after maturation, older cardiomyocytes would be even more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In parallel, drug-induced arrhythmias and QT-interval prolongation can also be examined for antiviral compounds in pre-clinical development, given that some existing COVID-19 drug treatments exhibit these off-target cardiotoxicities (Roden et al., 2020) .

Briefly, this approach uses the CHIR99021 GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor to initiate mesoderm specification, followed by Wnt-C59 Wnt inhibitor to initiate cardiac specification. Cells began beating at approximately day 7 post-differentiation. Cardiomyocytes were metabolically selected from other differentiated cells by using glucose deprivation as previously described (Sharma et al., 2015) . After selection, hiPSC-CMs were replated as a monolayer into 96-well plate format at 100,000 cells per well in hiPSC-CM culture medium, RPMI 1640 + B27 supplement with insulin.",

A) Human iPSC-CMs exhibit standard sarcomeric markers including cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and \u03b1-actinin with DAPI as nuclear counterstain. B) Immunofluorescence for cTnT and SARS-CoV-2 \"spike\" protein demonstrates that hiPSC-CMs can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is not present in mock infected cultures. C) HiPSC-CMs after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not mock infection, exhibit signs of cellular apoptosis, indicated by morphological changes seen in bright field (BF) and cleaved caspase-3 production. A second SARS-CoV-2 antibody marks a viral-specific doublestranded intermediate RNA (dsRNA). D) Magnified inset from panel B shows a merged immunofluorescence image for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and DAPI. Arrows indicate perinuclear accumulation of viral particles, and suggests active viral protein translation and genome replication at perinuclear ribosomes and membranous compartments. E) Magnified inset from panel C shows a merged immunofluorescence image for SARS-CoV-2 dsRNA and DAPI. Arrows indicate perinuclear viral replication sites.
