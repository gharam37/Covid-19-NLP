In the current paper we address this question using a simple estimation-prediction method. The input is the observed initial doubling time and a known value of R 0 . The simple General epidemic model is then fitted, and time calibration to calendar time is done using the observed number of case fatalities, together with estimates of the time between infection to death and the infection fatality risk. Finally, predictions are made assuming no change of behaviour, as well as for the situation where preventive measures are put in place at one specific time-point. The overall effect of the preventive measures is assumed to be known, or else estimated from the observed increased doubling time after preventive measures are put in place. The predictions are highly sensitive to the doubling times without and with preventive measures, sensitive to R 0 , but less sensitive to the estimates used for time-calibration: observed number of case fatalities, typical time between infection and death, and the infection fatality risk. The method is applied to the urban area of Stockholm, and predictions show that the peak of infections appear in mid-April and infections start settling in May.",

As a consequence, the iterative prediction model should have \u03bb = 0.330 replaced by \u03bb E = 0.209 on March 16 and onwards. As a side remark we note that this change of doubling time from 3.5 days to 9 days corresponds to changing R 0 = 2.5 to R E = 1 + (ln(2)/d E )/\u03b3 = 1.58 giving the magnitude of preventive effects of \u03c1 = 1 \u2212 R E /R 0 = 0.37 so a 37% overall reduction in contact rates.

The big effect of having different doubling times after preventive measures are put in place, corresponding to different magnitude of preventive measures, is illustrated by the alternative predictive curves. Finally, our model allows only for heterogeneity in terms of infectiousness. If heterogeneity in susceptibility as well as mixing patterns was included (thus making the model more realistic and complex) the result will typically be that the outbreak is slightly slower and less peaked. To investigate the exact effect, simulations from a realistic models are needed (and recommended!), but a rough estimate of the effect of heterogeneity is that the peak height is reduced by 25% and the left side of the peak is shifted about 1 week forward in 7 .

Since healthcare systems are directly affected by incidence, and peak incidence (with some delay for severe symptoms to develop) being the most problematic time for hospitals, this effect is very important. Quantifying the positive effect of prevention is hence not straightforward: should it be in terms of how many fewer that ultimately get infected, how much the peak is reduced, or something else? We have no clear answer to the question but one comparison that can be misleading is to compare the number of infections for two different scenarios at a given time point [6] . As an illustration, out main predictive curve (the blue curve) is clearly favourable compared to no preventive measures (the black curve). The peak size is reduced by 65%, and the final number infected is reduced from 1.80 million to 1.32 million. However, if we compare the cumulative number of infections on e.g. April 10, there are 1.59 million infected with no preventive measures and 0.79 million according to our main prediction. However, to say that these preventive measures have reduced the number of infections by 0.8 million is misleading. The curve for the preventive scenario is shifted to the right, and at the end of the outbreak the number of saved infections is 0.48 million rather than 0.80 million (of course still a substantial reduction!). The same reasoning applies when comparing the number of infected having required intensive care or case fatalities: to compare on a specific date during an outbreak can be misleading [6] .",

Clearly, the burden on the health care system measured by hospitalized patients or case fatalities, are more relevant quantities. When predicting these quantities, an age-structured model is advantageous since the risk for severe symptoms and death increases with age. However, there is also high uncertainty in what fraction of all infected that will require health care at different levels, as well as the infection fatality risk f . For example, current estimates of f (not to be mixed up with case fatality risk, cfr) vary between 0.2% up to 1% (e.g. [13] , [12] ). Clearly, any prediction of the number of fatalities will be equipped with very large uncertainty due to uncertainty in f let alone all other uncertainties, and this big uncertainty is most often not acknowledged by instead picking just one published estimate of f .",

However, our estimation-prediction methodology is much simpler and straightforward to implement, and we feel it is a useful complement to the more advanced methods referred to. As a consequence, it is much more transparent to see how the few model assumptions affect the results, and it is easy to vary the few parameters to see their effect on predictions. We hope the method will increase understanding about which parameteruncertainties that have biggest impact on predictions, and which parameter-uncertainties that are less influential. Finally, we expect this simple method to give predictions being quite similar to the more complicated models (and even more similar if reducing peak size and shifting epidemic curve forward in time as described in the Stockholm prediction), and if they don't there is strong reasons to investigate why this is not the case.",
