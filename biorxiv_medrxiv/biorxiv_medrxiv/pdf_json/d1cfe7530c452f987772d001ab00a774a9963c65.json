Here, we employ a mathematical model to explore the short-term consequences of lowering the reproduction number \u211b0 and delaying measures on total infections and fatalities. The positive implications of mitigation generally accrue as these measures are adopted early, with the most striking effects seen when the reproductive number is lowered to a level \u211bC\u22481.0. As the delay in adopting measures exceeds approximately the half-way point to the peak of an outbreak, the effects of lowering \u211b0 markedly decrease.",

A longer-term approach would integrate medicine (e.g., repurposed drugs, antibody transfusions, vaccines), technology (e.g., cell phone apps) and infrastructure (dedicated institutions) to reduce outbreaks and increase normalcy. The analysis showed that reacting insufficiently or increasingly late to an outbreak meant the need to enact more stringent 'suppression' measures to obtain a given level of reset in the numbers of infectious individuals. We found that this reset level, in turn, was crucial to how subsequent 'mitigation' measures could manage an outbreak. Importantly, approximate target levels were identified for lowered reproductive numbers, \u211b, that correspond to the rate of change in new cases.",

Note that with the possible exception of a given country adopting or modifying measure packages engaged in other countries, governments do not know beforehand exactly what a given set of measures will achieve in terms of precise reductions in \u211b0 and the corresponding impacts on the outbreak. Many countries -for example, Italy, France, Spain, Germany and the United States -are currently in the second (suggested mitigation measures, e.g., social distancing, quarantining...) or third (enforced lockdowns) phase of this simple suite of strategies. A successful step 2 that actually results in \u211bC<1.0 may take the country directly to step 4, or possibly step 5, the latter which also seeks \u211bC<1.0, but does so through less socially burdensome measures, such as the introduction of repurposed drugs and vaccination.",

In other words, whereas achieving 1.5\u2272 \u211bC<\u211b0 -if commenced early -can result in a substantial reduction in total infections by day 80 (Fig. 2A) , the effect is largely erased on the longer time horizon of 200 days (Fig. 2B) . Interestingly, small delays in starting mitigation measures from the start of a simulation may make little difference to the total number eventually infected. This effect is most noticeable between start days 10 and 30, as mitigation exceeds a 60% or greater decrease in \u211b0 (i.e., \u211bC\u22721.0), and for the longer time window of 200 days. Note that the lack of sensitivity between start days for lower mitigation in Fig. 2B can be explained by the fact that the epidemic is virtually complete by 200 (see Fig. 1 ). These results thus underscore how attaining mitigation objectives is contingent on the time frame, with rapid responses having short term benefits for a range of mitigation levels ( Fig. 2A) , whereas they have disproportionately higher benefits in the longer-term only for sufficiently pronounced mitigation levels (Fig. 2B) .",

Measures falling too short of the \u211bC\u22481.0 target can mean substantially diminished outcomes and the likelihood that additional measures are needed to mitigate the outbreak. This is in effect what we have observed in different countries, where sensible, but untested measures such as physical distancing, travel restrictions, washing hands frequently, coughing or sneezing away from others, and self-quarantining were insufficient in stemming new cases on time scales of days to weeks (21) . On the other hand, further reductions below \u211bC\u22481.0 may have specific objectives (e.g., steps 3 and 5 in the Introduction section), but come with increased constraints to personal freedoms and costs to the economy.",

We found that larger populations benefit more in terms of percentage reduced fatalities than do smaller populations. This can be explained in part because the same initial number (10000) of infectious individuals was used in all simulations, meaning that smaller countries were effectively further along in their outbreaks than were more populous ones. Nonetheless, this result and the findings of our previous study indicate that -all else being equal -larger populations have more time to reduce morbidity and mortality in outbreaks than do smaller ones. This insight could apply either to the homogenous populations assumed here, or to spatially subdivided ones, where we would expect delays in outbreaks between different localities. Further investigation is needed to establish how country size may correlate with other potentially important epidemic parameters such as population density and the age and spatial structure of contact networks.",

Mitigation measures engaged once an outbreak approaches its peak will have substantially less impact on infections and lessened fatalities than when started early.

The purpose of its use is to generate first approximations of how mitigation efforts modeled by the proxy parameter \u211bC could quantitively translate into the attenuation of outbreaks. Linking specific measures to their influence on key epidemiological parameters will be important in the future management of COVID-19. The influences of reductions in \u211b0 on key epidemiological parameters were investigated using the Epidemic Calculator package (16) (Supplementary Material). This platform enables the user to set the parameters under focus here, namely, the total population size (N), the initial sub-population of infections individuals (I), the basic reproduction number (\u211b0), the day on which the mitigation measures begin and the resulting (lowered) reproduction number (\u211bC).",

In contrast, survival chances drop below 50% under the same conditions in a population of c.100,000 individuals. Similar to the observations in the previous paragraphs, longer mitigation time frames require stronger impacts on \u211b0 to achieve equivalent benefits of shorter ones in terms of the percentage of lives saved (cf.",
