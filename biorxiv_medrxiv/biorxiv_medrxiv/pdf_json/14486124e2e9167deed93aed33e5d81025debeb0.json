As SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to endanger lives, effective therapeutics are urgently needed. Repurposing existing drugs could be an efficient and timely means of identifying drugs that have activity against coronavirus. There are a few repurposed drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir, baricitinib, remdesivir and chloroquine currently under clinical investigation 5, 6 . These drugs are expected to target key steps of viral entry, or specific proteins involved in viral replication, including viral proteases 7 . In addition to viral replication, the viral pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) (e.g., immune dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress, Figure 1A ) could be targeted to improve the clinical outcome 8 . PAMPs-mediated signaling pathways are attractive drug targets to alleviate diseases caused by human pathogens. Therefore, effectively targeting these pathways to stop the progression to ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2 might save lives. Independent of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in aging adult populations, ARDS is associated with mortality rates of 30-50% 9 . Thus, a methodical and unbiased search for new drug candidates from a large drug library could uncover agents that have potential to arrest the infection and ameliorate its effect. To accomplish this, we sought to target infection-induced genes in the host cells, hoping to mitigate disease progression and alleviate symptoms.",

The essential idea is to identify drugs that reverse the disease gene expression signature by suppressing the over-expressed disease genes and activating the repressed genes ( Figure 1A) . A disease signature is defined as a list of differentially expressed genes between disease samples and normal control samples. We recently found that the reversal of gene expression (namely sRGES) correlates to drug efficacy in cancers 17 , demonstrating the feasibility of applying this approach to predict drug candidates for other diseases, including viral infection.",

            "text": "To utilize this approach for drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2, we first need to collect virus-related host gene expression profiles, which were not available at the time of writing. Given the high genomic similarity between SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, we reasoned that existing host gene expression profiles of the samples infected by SARS-or MERS-CoV could approximate to those infected by SARS-CoV-2. To verify this assumption, we compiled 331 virus-induced signatures from enrichR and GEO (Table   S1 ) and used an established pipeline to score 1740 drugs in our repurposing library regarding their reversal of signature gene expression. Clustering of these signatures based on their drug prediction scores suggests that signatures derived from the same virus or the virus family under the similar experimental model tend to cluster together ( Figure S1 ). An example cluster includes one signature derived from primary human microvascular endothelial cells (MMVE001) after 48h of MERS-CoV infection (study id: GSE79218) and another derived from melanoma cells in mice after seven days of SARS-CoV infection (study id: GSE68820). In addition, Spearman correlation coefficient of the in vitro drug efficacy data (EC50: Half maximal effective concentration) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is up to 0.6 ( Figure 1B) . The clustering and correlation results suggested that drugs predicted based on the signatures related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV could also be applied for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we developed a pipeline to repurpose existing drugs against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and then experimentally evaluate these drugs in SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 1C ). database. A good candidate should activate the repressed biological processes and inhibit the upregulated processes. B, Correlation of the published antiviral activities of 30 drugs (pEC50, -log10 transformed EC50 value in mol/L) against MERS-and SARS-CoV. C, Study workflow including creation of disease signatures, prediction of drug candidates, selection of a final drug list, and in vitro validation. One disease signature composed by the differentially expressed genes of each comparison led to one drug prediction list. Only the signature resulting in a prediction list where known positive drugs were enriched on the top was considered as a valid signature. D, Dysregulated pathways after SARS infection at 7h compared with 2h in lungs. E, The enrichment of top six dysregulated pathways in primary human microvascular endothelial (MMVE001) cells through 0h to 48h in MERS-CoV infection (left) and in mock (right). Only one study was selected for D and E, respectively, and the dysregulated pathways and their dynamics for other studies are available in supplementary materials ( Figure S2 and S3, Extended Data 1).",

Their expression profiles were created using either microarray or RNA-Sequencing. Depending on the profiling platform, data processing and signature creation methods For each comparison, we computed a disease signature to characterize the infection status, followed by the prediction of which drugs may have activity. As we could not directly evaluate the quality and pathologic relevance of each disease signature, we turned to validating their action using those drugs that are positive in vitro MERS/SARS testing (41 positive drugs in total, 30 with EC50 values, Table S2 ). Among 215 MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection signatures, 13 signatures led to the drug list, where positive drugs are highly enriched on the top (Extended Data 2). Moreover, EC50 of these drugs significantly correlated with sRGES ( Figure 2A and Figure S4 ). In contrast, for the H1N1 infection signatures, we didn't observe any significant enrichment of anti-coronavirus positive drugs (Extended Data 2). The recent clinical data suggested that the combination of two drugs lopinavir/ritonavir present clinical benefits to patients with coronavirus 18, 19 . Both drugs were profiled in LINCS 20 individually; however, none of them could induce substantial gene expression change (absolute z score < 2) under 10 \u00b5M concentration in cancer cell lines; therefore, neither was predicted as a hit. We next found another dataset where HepaRG cells were treated by ritonavir under 10 different concentrations (from 9 nM to 300 \u00b5M). We observed that ritonavir could reverse nearly all the 13 disease signatures under high concentration (i.e., 10 \u00b5M to 200 \u00b5M) ( Figure S5 ).",

Instead of measuring EC50, we used more stringent criteria, which required a 4-day complete prevention of CPE observed under the microcopy. Six of the proposed drugs showed less than 10 \u00b5M minimum concentration that could completely prevent CPE. However, five of them presented unfavorable cytotoxicity at their effective concentration. In the following confirmatory experiment, we examined the efficacy and toxicity for the four most effective drugs (CPE preventing concentration <= 1 \u00b5M), bortezomib, methotrexate, nvp-bez235 and alvocidib as well as chloroquine, a drug being used as the first-line treatment for SARS-CoV-2.

Therefore, we enumerated all the possible comparisons (Figure 1C), including (1) comparisons between infection and mock at each time point, (2) comparisons between different time points within the infection or the mock group (e.g., time point 1 vs. time point 0, time point 2 vs. time point 1), and (3) comparisons both between time points and between infection vs. mock. These comparisons revealed different virus-related biological processes and their dynamic regulation. For instance, analysis of SARS-CoV infected lung tissue data showed that various biological processes, including viral gene expression, DNA replication, nuclear division, lymphocytes differentiation and translation-related processes, were activated (Figure 1D, S2 and Extended Data 1). In contrast, interleukin and autophagy-related processes were repressed in infected samples (Figure 1D, S2 and Extended Data 1). Interestingly, some processes were only activated after a certain time point (e.g., 24 h inFig 1E)in infected samples, while such patterns were not observed in mock samples (Figure 1E and S3), suggesting that only some of the comparisons captured the biology of critical viral infection processes.",

            "text": ". The validation justified the approach of reversal of host cell gene expression derived from SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection. Ten drugs were proposed and their antiviral efficacy and cytotoxicity in the Vero E6 cell line were further examined. We observed that four drugs prevented CPE under 1 \u00b5M, but also were toxic at this concentration. We initially only excluded those highly toxic compounds such as topoisomerase inhibitors, but didn't attempt to evaluate their cytotoxicity since all those candidates are FDA approved drugs with established safety profiles.Genes related to mitotic G2/M cell cycle such as MELK, KIF14, BIRC5 were enriched (Figure 2D), thus reversal of the expression of these genes might induce apoptosis and cytotoxicity. On the other side, several immune signaling related genes such as CCL2, CXCL2 and NFKBIA were down-regulated by the virus, thus reversal of the expression of these genes may augment the host response to fight viral infection. Our initial efficacy study neither checked their ability of inhibiting viral replications nor used the model that has necessary immune environment (e.g., Vero cells are interferon-deficient). For example, the candidate methotrexate, a chemotherapeutic at high doses and, an immune suppressor at lower doses, being used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), showed considerable in vitro antiviral effect. Methotrexate could down regulate genes related to G2/M cell cycle, and up regulate genes related to cytokine signaling. This is not surprising as studies have shown some of the interferon related pathways that govern inflammation overlap with cancer26 . Recently, another RA drug, tocilizumab, an IL-6 antibody, was applied to treat severe patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 to protect them from life-threatening lung damage caused by cytokine storm.Further analysis of drug-induced in vivo profiles revealed that methotrexate and tocilizumab could stimulate several interferon-stimulated genes for virus blocking (Figure S6), but chloroquine could stimulate less, suggesting a different MoA (e.g. pH dependent control of viral entry). We are interested in testing methotrexate on other interferon sufficient cell lines in the future.Notably, all four effective drugs (proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, PI3K-mTOR inhibitor nvp-bez235 (dactolisib), CDK inhibitor alvocidib and antimetabolite methotrexate) are being used for cancer treatment.In several independent screening efforts, similar drugs (AXL receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor Gilteritinib, CDK inhibitor Abemaciclib) are identified21,27 . Although those anti-cancer drugs might reverse the host expression and prevent CPE, because they are often toxic or have severe side effects, they are not appropriate to treat patients weakened by SARS-CoV-2.For this work, in addition to the known limitations of the LINCS datasets (e.g., a limited coverage of the transcriptome), another limitation lies in the use of drug-induced gene expression profiles derived from cancer cells that are different from those infected cells. This partially explains why anti-viral drugs were not predicted as hits. The limited resources and the immeasurable damage of this pandemic call for the urgent needs of studying existing drugs in infectious disease models.In conclusion, thanks to the open science initiatives, we were able to leverage the open resources to rationally predict drug candidates that might reverse coronavirus-induced transcriptomic change, and validated in silico and in vitro. The unbiased search of drug candidates based on reversal of gene expression could offer an effective and rapid means to propose candidates for further experimental testing, yet more layers of information such as toxicity, validation experimental setting and clinical applicability could be incorporated to find better therapeutics. The prediction list would be of some value to those labs who have the capability to investigate a few compounds, especially during this urgent time.",

Expression values were normalized using quantile normalization and log2 transformation was applied for each matrix. The probe values were collapsed based on Entrez Gene ID. The Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) method was used to compute differentially expressed (DE) genes with criteria fold change > 1 and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05).

EdgeR was used to compute DE genes using the same criteria as used for microarray data. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of DE genes for each comparison was performed using the clusterprofiler R package. Further, gene set enrichment (ssGSEA) for each biological process was performed using ssGSEA method in the GSVA R package. For the infection group, we enumerated all the comparisons across all time points, and the corresponding comparison was performed in the mock group as well. The DE genes that were uniquely present in the infection group were selected for further analysis. We also compared DE genes between infection and mock at each time point, together with consistently dysregulated genes from time point 0 to the end.

Briefly, a full matrix comprising 476,251 signatures and 22,268 genes including 978 landmark genes was downloaded from the LINCS website 30 as of September 2013. The meta-information of the signatures (for example, cell line, treatment duration, treatment concentration) was retrieved via LINCS Application Program Interfaces. The matrix and metadata are now available via GSE92742 in GEO. The signature derived from the comparison of expressions between the samples treated with the perturbagen of interest and vehicle control, represents gene expression change upon treatment.

Briefly, we quantified the reversal of disease gene expression as RGES (Reversal Gene Expression Score), a measure modified from the connectivity score developed in other studies20 . To compute RGES scores, we first rank genes based on their expression values in each drug signature. An enrichment score/s for each set of up-and down-regulated disease genes were computed separately using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov-like statistic, followed by the merge of scores from both sides (up/down). The score is based on the amount to which the genes (up or down-regulated) at either the top or bottom of a drug-gene list ranked by expression change after drug treatment. One compound may have multiple available expression profiles because they have been tested in various cell lines, drug concentrations, treatment durations, or even different replicates, resulting in multiple RGES for one drugdisease prediction. We termed this score summarized RGES (sRGES). We set a reference condition (i.e., concentration of 10 \u00b5M, treatment duration of 24 hours) and used a model to estimate a new RGES if the drug profile under the reference condition was not available. We did not weight the LINCS cell lines. Those comparisons, where maximum of the absolute sRGES is less than 0.25 were considered as insignificant predictions.Signatures validation and selectionDrugs with known in vitro activity against two coronaviruses (i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) served as positive controls for signature validation. Qualified signatures should meet the following criteria: (1) derived from SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection experiments; (2) the number of differentially expressed genes was greater than 50 (mapped to LINCS); (3) the maximum absolute sRGES prediction was greater than 0.25; (4) the sRGES of positive drugs was enriched at the top (one side Wilcoxon rank-sum test p < 0.05, FDR < 0.25); (5) the sRGES and the average EC50 value of positive drugs were highly correlated (Spearman r >= 0.4, p < 0.05).",
