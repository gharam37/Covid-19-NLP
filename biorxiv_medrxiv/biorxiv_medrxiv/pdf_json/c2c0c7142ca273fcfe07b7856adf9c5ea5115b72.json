Currently, several quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays are being used by clinical, research, and public health laboratories. However, it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to evaluate the primer-probe sets used in four common diagnostic assays available on the World Health Organization (WHO) website. To facilitate this effort, we generated RNA transcripts to be used as assay standards and distributed them to other laboratories for internal validation. We then used these (1) RNA transcript standards, (2) full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and (3) pre-COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swabs, and (4) clinical samples from COVID-19 patients to determine analytical efficiency and sensitivity of the qRT-PCR primer-probe sets. We show that all primer-probe sets can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2, but there are clear differences in the ability to differentiate between true negatives and positives with low amounts of virus. We found that several primer-probe sets cross-react with SARS-CoV-2-negative nasopharyngeal swabs. However, background cross-reactivity by the 2019-nCoV_N2 set issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not interfere with outcomes of the combined \"N1\" and \"N2\" assay when testing COVID-19 clinical samples. Our findings characterize the limitations of currently used .

As the full length SARS-CoV-2 RNA is considered as a biological safety level 2 hazard in the US, we generated small RNA transcripts (704-1363 nt) from the non-structural protein 10 (nsp10), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), non-structural protein 14 (nsp14), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) genes spanning each of the primer and probe sets in the China CDC 7 , US CDC 6 , Charit\u00e9 5 , and HKU 4 assays ( Fig. 1A ; Table 1; Supplemental Tables 1-2 ) 10 . By measuring PCR amplification using 10-fold serial dilutions of our RNA transcript standards, we found the efficiencies of each of the nine primer-probe sets to be above 90% ( Fig. 1B ) , which match the criteria for an efficient qRT-PCR assay 11 . Our RNA transcripts can thus be used for assay validation, positive controls, and standards to quantify viral loads: critical steps for a diagnostic assay.

Interestingly, with the N1 set, samples with a Ct value of approximately 40 and samples that were not detected (ND) were clearly discrete groups, whereas several samples that were not detected by the N1 set were in the 41-43 Ct range for the N2 set ( Fig. 5B ). This further supports our observation that the US CDC 2019-nCoV_N2 primer-probe set produces some non-specific amplification. However, when we look at the US CDC assay outcomes, which take into account both the N1 and N2 results, only 1 out of 172 tests was deemed inconclusive due to N1 being negative (>40 Ct) and N2 being positive (<40 Ct) due to non-specific amplification ( Fig. 5C ). When a more stringent Ct value cut-off of 38 was implemented, we did not detect any inconclusive results where N2 was the only positive set. In fact, we found more inconclusive results where N1 was the only positive set at both 40 Ct (3/172) and 38 Ct (5/172) cut-offs ( Fig. 5C ), likely because the 2019-nCoV_N1 primer-probe set is more sensitive ( Figs. 4, 5A, 5B ). Overall, we generated inconclusive results from less than 3% of the tested clinical samples using the US CDC primer-probe sets, indicating that background cross-reactivity does not have a large impact on the testing outcomes.

To investigate the effect of primer-probe concentration on the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2, we made a direct comparison between ( 1 ) our standardized primer (500 nM) and probe (250 nM) concentrations, ( 2 ) the recommended concentrations of 600 nM of forward primer, 800 nM of reverse primer, and 100 nM of probe 1 and 2 (confirmatory assay), and ( 3 ) the recommended concentrations of 600 nM of forward primer, 800 nM of reverse primer, and 200 nM of probe 2 (discriminatory assay) per reaction 5 .

This degenerate nucleotide appears to have been added to help the primer anneal to SARS-CoV and bat-SARS-related CoV genomes 5 , seemingly to the detriment of consistent SARS-CoV-2 detection. Earlier in the outbreak, before hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 genomes became available, non-SARS-CoV-2 data were used to infer genetic diversity that could be anticipated during the outbreak.

While these substitutions define a large clade that includes~13% of the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes and has been detected in numerous countries 14 , their position on the 5' location of the primer may not be detrimental to sequence annealing and amplification. The other high frequency variant that we detected was T\u2192C substitution at the 8 th position of the binding region of the 2019-nCoV_N3 forward primer, a substitution found in 39 genomes (position 28,688).

We found that the most sensitive primer-probe sets are E-Sarbeco (Charit\u00e9), HKU-ORF1 (HKU), HKU-N (HKU), and 2019-nCoV_N1 (US CDC), which could partially (63-75%) detect SARS-CoV-2 at 10 virus copies per \u03bcL of RNA. In contrast, the RdRp-SARSr (Charit\u00e9) primer-probe set had the lowest sensitivity, as also shown by an independent study 13 , likely stemming from a mismatch in the reverse primer. Furthermore, we found background cross-reactivity when testing nasopharyngeal swabs prior to the COVID-19 pandemic using the China CDC and US CDC assays. While the China CDC \"N\" and \"ORF1\" primer-probe sets require further investigation, we found that the background cross-reactivity did not affect the outcomes of the US CDC assay when testing clinical samples from the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, our findings indicate that the qRT-PCR assay from HKU, the screening assay (E-Sarbeco) from Charit\u00e9, and the updated assay from the US CDC are most reliable for accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2.",

One possibility is that these primers and probes can slightly amplify other seasonal coronaviruses. We did not detect cross-reactivity when using the Charit\u00e9 and HKU sets, and indeed, the assay developers reported that the primers and probes did not detect other circulating coronaviruses and respiratory viruses 4, 5 . Cross-reactivity with other viruses would severely limit the utility of any assay and requires further investigation.",

            "text": "Our study does have several limitations to consider. First, we standardized PCR conditions to make a fair comparison between primer-probes sets used in four common qRT-PCR assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2. By standardizing the concentration of primers and probes, PCR kits, and thermocycler conditions, we deviated from the conditions as recommended by each assay which may have influenced our findings. For instance, we selected an annealing temperature of 55\u00b0C which was lower than recommended for the assays developed by Charit\u00e9 (58\u00b0C) 5 and HKU (60\u00b0C) 4 , but similar to the assay developed by US CDC (55\u00b0C) 6 . No specific PCR conditions were reported for the assay developed by the China CDC 7 . The two assays (Charit\u00e9 and HKU) with higher annealing temperatures did not yield background amplification, which suggests that our standardized annealing temperature likely did not have a large effect on our findings. Second, when determining the sensitivity of primer-probe sets, we performed eight replicates at low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA spiked into (pre-COVID-19) clinical samples. While we evaluated the US CDC using 172 clinical samples collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, more replicates for the other assays are required to accurately determine the lower detection limit. Importantly, sensitivity as reported in our study may not be applicable to other PCR kits or thermocyclers; analytical sensitivities and positive-negative cut-off values should be locally validated when establishing these assays.",

Using PCR, we amplified the nsp10, RdRp, nsp14, E, and N genes with specifically designed primers ( Supplemental Table 1 ). We purified PCR products using the Mag-Bind TotalPure NGS kit (Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA, USA) and quantified products using the Qubit High Sensitivity DNA kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). We determined fragment sizes using the DNA 1000 kit on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). After quantification, we transcribed 100-200 ng of each purified PCR product into RNA using the Megascript T7 kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). We quantified RNA transcripts using the Qubit High sensitivity RNA kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and checked quality using the Bioanalyzer RNA pico 6000 kit. For each of the RNA transcript standards ( Supplemental Table 2 ), we calculated the number of genome copies per \u00b5L using Avogadro's number. We generated a genomic annotation plot with all newly generated RNA transcript standards and the nine tested primer-probe sets based on the NC_045512 reference genome using the DNA Features Viewer Python package ( Fig.  1A ) 16 . We generated standard curves for each combination of primer-probe set with its corresponding RNA transcript standard ( Fig. 1B ) , using standardized qRT-PCR conditions as described below.",
