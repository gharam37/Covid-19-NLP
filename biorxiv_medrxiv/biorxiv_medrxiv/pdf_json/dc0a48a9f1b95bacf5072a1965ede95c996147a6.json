It is shown that the model exhibits a backward bifurcation at R 0 = 1 when recovered 7 individuals do not develop a permanent immunity for the disease. In the absence of reinfection, it is 8 proved that the model is without backward bifurcation and the disease free equilibrium is globally 9 asymptotically stable for R 0 < 1. By using available data, the model is validated and parameter 10 values are estimated. The sensitivity of the value of R 0 to changes in any of the parameter values 11 involved in its formula is analysed. Moreover, various mitigation strategies are investigated using 12 the proposed model and it is observed that the asymptomatic infectious group of individuals may 13 play the major role in the re-emergence of the disease in the future. Therefore, it is recommended 14 that in the absence of vaccination, countries need to develop capacities to detect and isolate at least 15 30% of the asymptomatic infectious group of individuals while treating in isolation at least 50% of 16 symptomatic patients to control the disease.",

The basic properties of the model including well-posedness, the 513 disease free equilibrium and its stability, model basic reproduction number as well as existence of 514 backward bifurcation were examined.

Consequently, the daily number of cases is kept at low 536 manageable levels. In addition, increasing the average effectiveness of the self-protective measures and 537 adherence to such measures is vital in realising low peaks of the number of cases. Furthermore, due to 538 the absence of vaccination or any approved medication, developing capacity to detect carrier groups 539 is very important. From our results, it is recommended that countries should develop capacities to 540 identify and quarantine at least 30% of carriers as well as at least 50% of symptomatic cases if the 541 infection is to be controlled. Our model predicts a possible resurgence of the number of cases if the 542 asymptomatic cases are still many by the time disease spread curbs/lockdown measures are lifted. 543 It is also evident that practising social/physical distancing, good hygiene and disinfecting surfaces 544 to eliminate the virus from surface are vital in reducing the disease burden. But the contribution of 545 disinfecting surfaces is not that high. In addition, we observe from simulations that although disease 546 spread curbs (such as a lockdown measure) may be imposed, their real impact on the number of new 547 cases may only be realised after approximately 21 days, and the reduction (when it appears) could be 548 sharp in the case of a strict lockdown measure with high impact in reducing effective contact between 549 individuals in the population.",
