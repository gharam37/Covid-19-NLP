In scenarios where asymptomatic infected individuals are transmitting significantly, we expect a rapidly growing epidemic which cannot be contained only by case isolation. In these scenarios, there is potential for a very high percentage of the population becoming infected (median estimates: >80% over six months), and a significant epidemic of symptomatic COVID-19 cases. Exceptional social distancing measures can slow transmission, flattening the epidemic curve, but the risk of epidemic rebound after lifting restrictions is predicted to be high.",

However, the likelihood of a significant outbreak remains high, with potentially severe consequences for fragile regional health systems (Makoni 2020) . The potentially high negative impact of a novel coronavirus outbreak in Kenya provides a strong motivation for forecasting studies of COVID-19 epidemic magnitude ahead of a serious outbreak under a number of plausible scenarios. This modeling study provides a baseline for continuous updating as improved data become available, e.g. time course of COVID-19 cases, updated mobility estimates, and the proportion and infectivity of asymptomatic infections, and new intervention strategies are proposed or implemented. It also provides the basis for studies of health service capacity; see accompanying article (Barasa et al, 2020) .",

The role of asymptomatic infected individuals (in this study we abbreviate to \"asymptomatics\") in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. A significant majority of detections of SARS-CoV-2 infection have occurred after infected individuals have presented clinically with COVID-19. Clinical cases of COVID-19 have presented mostly among older age groups (CPERE 2020) . This could be due to a stronger resistance among younger age groups to contracting SARS-CoV-2 (Zhang et al. 2020 ; Hilton & Keeling 2020) , or due to younger people developing COVID-19 symptoms at a lower rate after contracting SARS-CoV-2, leading to under-ascertainment amongst those age groups. One epidemiological study of 391 confirmed cases and their 1,286 close contacts in Shenzen found that children were as likely to be infected as adults (Bi et al. 2020) , despite presenting with symptoms less frequently. Another modelling study emphasizes the role of undetected subclinical transmission in explaining the observed epidemic dynamics in China (Li, R. et al. 2020) . These findings informed a central assumption of our modelling: that all age-groups are equally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection but that the symptomatic rate is different across age groups.",

However, this presents a difficulty in translating symptomatic rates derived from Chinese confirmed COVID-19 clinical case data into a prediction of incidence in the Kenyan setting. Mildly symptomatic cases, defined as non-pneumonia and mild pneumonia cases by China CDC (CPERE, 2020) , that presented to the health system in China might not present to the health system in Kenya. In this study, we provide forecasts of the possible epidemic course of COVID-19 infections, focussing on symptomatic infection, following initial invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into Kenya. We recognize the limitations of using clinically detected cases from another setting (China) to infer a symptomatic rate in this setting (Kenya) . This reflects the difficulty in ascertaining COVID-19 disease with an unclear available testing capacity and coverage. This limitation highlights the importance of the sensitivity analysis in this modelling study. We treated all sub-clinical undetected infected individuals in China as asymptomatic. However, the threshold for being a sub-clinical infected individual will be different in Kenya and might miss significantly infectious, or even diseased, individuals. This observation led us to consider a range of infectiousness scenarios for asymptomatic cases, each scenario being capable of explaining the agedistribution of cases observed in China.",

In a scenario where younger age groups are developing COVID-19 symptoms at a lower rate after infection compared to older age groups and their infectiousness is negligible (0%) then the R0 we predict for Kenya is substantially lower than the R0 for China (28.8% lower). This is also true if younger age groups are more resistant to contracting SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) .

This had the effect of increasing the contact rate for 75+ year old individuals compared to before SD measures were implemented, because there is believed to be frequent within-household mixing between the elderly and children/young adults in Kenya ( Figure 4 ). This combination of interventions (SD+MR+CI) was predicted to be sufficient to slow down transmission and flatten the epidemic curve of COVID-19 in the scenarios where asymptomatics transmit SARS-CoV-2; that is, to eventually push the Kenyan reproductive number below 1. However, maintaining SD measures for the entire course of the epidemic is extremely challenging socially and economically. Therefore, we investigated the effect of implementing the full set of interventions for 90 days after the detection of established transmission within the country followed by a relaxation. We found that despite reducing transmission over the 90 days of implementation (median estimate 0 symptomatic cases after 90 days in all scenarios), there was a high probability of a rebound epidemic rapidly after relaxation of intervention measures. In the absence of a return to strict interventions if incidence rates are observed to increase, or novel effective vaccines/antivirals becoming available, the rebound epidemic was predicted to be similar in magnitude to the avoided epidemic ( Figure 5 ).",

This observation suggests that the symptomatic rate estimated here could be an overestimate of the clinical incidence that will be seen in Kenya. On the other hand, it should be noted that our estimate for the symptomatic rate is somewhat lower in some age groups than other estimates in the literature.

In particular, it is possible that controlling a COVID-19 epidemic in Kenya will require measures which can break transmission from household to household. However, an explicit household structure is not part of the KenyaCoV modelling framework. We replicate the effect of household structure in our modelling of social distancing using a combination of social context dependent agestructured mixing matrices and an effective decline in contact rate as individuals reduce contacts among the general population in favour of repeated contacts with a relatively small group of people within their own household. Whilst this is less realistic than a full, individual-based stochastic model, see for example Ferguson et al (Ferguson et al. 2005) , the benefit of using KenyaCoV is that, in the event of a substantial COVID-19 epidemic in Kenya, the model is sufficiently performant that incorporating new information into forecasting could occur in near real-time. As mentioned above, it is critical that estimates of the symptomatic rate, clinical fraction, and rate of severe disease are derived from Kenyan case data rather than simply extrapolated from other settings. Such Kenyanspecific estimates of COVID-19, augmented by more recent data on Kenyan mobility, will allow us to better understand the link between transmission predictions (as given by KenyaCoV), and the observed clinical burden of COVID-19 in Kenya. Without understanding the link between transmission and clinical burden the design of public health interventions is done blind, and it is impossible to evaluate intervention success.",

We have attempted to partially account for these underlying uncertainties by drawing some parameters from a plausible range rather than simply using point estimates. However, some of the epidemiological uncertainties are fundamental to the structure of the KenyaCoV model. First, we treat the rate of developing symptoms as the detection rate in the model, following that the substantial majority of confirmed cases in the China were initially syndromic detections before test confirmation (CPERE 2020). However, since the symptomatic rates used in KenyaCoV were inferred from the age distribution of Chinese confirmed cases, this means that our model is predicting the incidence rate of cases that would have been clinical in the Chinese epidemic. It could be that the syndromic threshold for detection is different in Kenya, which would alter the effective transmission rate of the undetected cases by changing the definition of detected and undetected cases so that infectious and diseased individuals might be missed in the Kenyan context who would have been identified in the Chinese context. Second, and following from the previous comment, the rate of subclinical undetected transmission is critical to the expected outcome of an epidemic in Kenya. This reflects the fact that COVID-19 disease has been predominantly observed amongst older age groups, and therefore two major possibilities for a country with a younger demography arise. In the first possibility, the relatively large proportion of younger people effectively protect the elderly at-risk groups from transmission. In the second possibility, high rates of unobserved transmission within the young population cause significant numbers of clinical cases among the elderly. We don't know which outcome will occur until a substantial number of cases are observed, and so far, no major COVID-19 epidemic has occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. If there exists climatic incompatibility for this strain of coronavirus and/or inherent resistance in the population then all modelling estimates derived from the Chinese experience should be revised downwards. Finally, our model presents a partial picture of the likely effects of government interventions to slow the transmission of COVID-19. Government interventions such as social distancing and movement restrictions have secondary health, social and economic effects that should be considered when making decisions about how to intervene (Dahab et al. 2020; Barasa 2020) . For instance, these interventions could disrupt routine health service delivery and access (such as vaccinations, and maternal and child health services), cause income and job losses in ways that could push households into poverty, and lead to a shrinking of country economies. Incorporating these dimensions in models, and ascertaining net health and non-health benefits of interventions would provide a fuller picture and improve the quality of decision making.",

We followed Tang et al (Tang et al. 2020) in including a decreasing rate of contacts over time. The decreasing rate of contacts was combined with the change in age structured mixing, and attempted to account for increasing population compliance, a staggered step of extra interventions (e.g. closing nonessential shops and instigating a curfew), and the effective decrease in contacts across the population due to redirecting social contacts towards repeated contacts within the home. Specifically, we use the down-ramp function to represent a decrease in contacts by 50% over 30 days after the social distancing intervention: ( ) = 1 \u2212 0.5( \u2212 8 )/30 for times between the intervention time 8 and 30 days after SD intervention",

The Chinese ; \u223c ( = 100, = 2.5/100), which corresponded to a median belief that the SARS-CoV-2 ; for China is equally likely to be above 2.5 as below (2.5-97.5 percentiles of belief ; = 2.03 \u2212 3.01). The mean incubation period 1/ \u223c ( = (5), = 0.25); median belief 1/ = 5 days (3.1-8.2 days).
