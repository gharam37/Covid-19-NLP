            "text": "On January 21, 2020, the first case of Coronavirus disease 2019 in the 2 United States was reported in Washington State [1] . The first case was not reported in 3 New York state until March 1, 2020 [2] . By the time the World Health Organization 4 (WHO) declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 , there were 345 cases in New 5 York City (NYC), and this number skyrocketed to nearly 18,000 cases just two weeks 6 later [2, 3] . NYC rapidly became the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, 7 with a transmission rate five times higher than the rest of the country, and over a third 8 of all confirmed national cases by early April [4] . 9 During a pandemic, there is likely to be large variation in both disease transmission 10 and disease testing between regions [5] . These two factors cause large variation in 11 disease reporting between different areas [6] . This is particularly true in the early stages 12 of the outbreak, before disease testing has become widespread and standardized. 13 Contemporary and historical studies on previous pandemics, including H1N1 14 pandemics in 1918 and 2009, suggest that socioeconomic factors on a national level can 15 affect detection rates and medical outcomes [7] [8] [9] . Thus, socioeconomic factors such as 16 young or old populations, race, affluence, inequality, poverty, unemployment, insurance, 17 or access to healthcare may account for differences in reported cases of COVID-19 18 between neighborhoods in NYC. 19 The aim of this ecological study was to identify potential neighborhood-level 20 socioeconomic determinants of the number of detected COVID-19 cases and explain 21 between-neighborhood variation during the early, exponential growth stage of the 22 pandemic in NYC: from the first detected case in March 1 until April 5, 2020. 23 Materials and methods 24 Data collection 25 Data on positive COVID-19 cases were collected from NYC Department of Health and 26 Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) Incident Command System for COVID-19 Response 27 (Surveillance and Epidemiology Branch in collaboration with Public Information Office 28 Branch) [2] . Since the NYC DOHMH was discouraging people with mild to moderate 29 symptoms from being tested during the time period covered, the data primarily 30 represents people with more severe illness. Since at the time of writing the pandemic is 31 still ongoing, data were taken at a snapshot on April 5, 2020. This date was chosen to 32 cover the first month of the pandemic in NYC, since understanding early etiology of the 33 pandemic and local influences is important in helping to inform future management [10] . 34 Data were a cumulative count up to and including April 5, 2020. On this date, NYC 35 had a cumulative total of 64,955 cases [11] , including deaths and hospitalizations. 36 The available dataset included 64,512 cases (99.3% of total cases), with each case 37 representing a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 along with the patient's Zip Code 38 Tabulation Area (ZCTA). ZCTAs are generalized areal representations of United States 39 Postal Service (USPS) Zip Code service areas. ZCTAs were the areas in which patients 40 reported their home address, as opposed to either where they became symptomatic or 41 where they reported for testing/treatment. The area of interest covered 177 ZCTAs Queens, and Staten Island); Fig 1B displays Bureau American Community Survey (ACS). ACS is a continuous sample survey of 52 3.5 million households every year including questions beyond the decadal census on 53 subjects such as education, employment, internet access, and transportation. Data were 54 collected at ZCTA level from the ACS 2014-2018 5-year estimate [12] , which is the most 55 recent publicly available. The 5-year estimate was chosen instead of the most recent 56 1-year estimate because the latter was not available in an aggregated form at ZCTA 57 level. Whilst the 5-year estimate is less current, it has a smaller margin of error than 58 the 1-year estimates and greater statistical reliability for small geographic areas. i.e., populations typically economically inactive. Aged population was the percentage of 65 the total population 65+. The increased severity of COVID-19 with increasing age has 66 been well documented [13] , and there has been recent evidence of asymptomatic carrier 67 transmission particularly amongst young people [14, 15] . Males per 100 females was 68 chosen to capture the balance of sex in the population. We were interested in whether 69 sex differences lead to significant variation in detected cases. Finally, some reports 70 suggest a racial disparity in case detection rates across the USA. A report from NYU 71 Furman Center for housing, neighborhoods, and urban policy suggests mortality rates 72 are higher amongst the city's \"Hispanic, Black, and non-Hispanic/Latino: Other\" 73 populations [16] . For the present study, we chose to include the percentage of the against the adverse effects of unequal income [17] , an association has been demonstrated 85 between inequality and population health [18] . We also included household income, 86 which was a significant predictor for hospitalizations in the 2009 influenza 87 pandemic [19] . Specifically, in the present study we use median household income as a 88 ZCTA-level predictor. Finally, unemployment and poverty both have documented 89 association with health outcomes, including in pandemic scenarios [20, 21] . Whilst there 90 is some level of collinearity between these two variables, we include both as one relates 91 to the economically active labor force whereas the other to the total population. The ",

We believe that 245 taken together, this indicates that the youthful end of the dependent population is 246 associated with higher case numbers. This is congruent with evidence from Chan et 247 al. [14] and Bai et al. [15] , both of whom suggest significant transmission by young 248 asymptomatic carriers. We further hypothesize that attitudes and behavioral patterns 249 could play a significant role in this effect. As an example, increasing mortality of 250 COVID-19 with age has been well publicized, and we suggest this may incline older 251 communities to adhere to preventative public-health measures more. Conversely the 252 same information may be interpreted by younger populations that they are not at 253 significant risk, potentially encouraging riskier behaviors.",

The increased urban density likely contributes to transmission of the 284 virus among the neighborhood [43] . Whilst previous studies [44] have found influence of 285 unemployment on disease transmission, we note that the unprecedented shut-down of 286 national infrastructure and the economy has meant that many previously employed 287 people suddenly found themselves either unemployed, furloughed, or working from home. 288 In a short period of time this drastic measure has completely altered the employment 289 landscape of NYC such that it is unsurprising the predictor from 2018 is not significant. 290 We found that neither of our healthcare-related predictors was consistently 291 significant. Lack of insurance has previously been a barrier to both diagnosis and 292 treatment [45, 46] . However, in the COVID-19 pandemic, significant state resources were 293 directed such that testing was freely available to all eligible New York residents. 294 We note four key limitations of the ecological study. First, our dependent variable is 295 the number of detected COVID-19 cases, which may be significantly different from the 296 number of true cases [47] . We believe, however that this does not detract from the 297 validity of the study, since characterization of the detection and prevalance is important 298 for pandemic management [48] . Studies on HIV rates amongst at risk populations 299 suggest that the relationship between predictors and the number of detected cases is 300 likely a complex interaction via at least three pathways: the true number of cases, access 301 to testing (means) [49] , and population attitudes to testing (motivation) [50, 51] . Thus, 302 we can still develop valid inferences, even if we cannot elicit with certainty which one (or 303 ones) of these pathways the significant predictors act through. Second, any associations 304 made must be interpreted with caution since, as with any observational study, spurious 305 correlations produced by unstudied confounding factors may be present. Caution is also 306 advised due to the ecological fallacy of making individual inferences from aggregate data. 307 Further verification is required to determine true causative links between predictors and 308 detected cases even when associations are significant. Third, the significant predictors 309 found are likely not the only explanations for different detection rates between different 310 neighborhoods. However this study does provide useful insight into explaining city limits at the borough level, there may be borough-level biases relating to 313 COVID-19 testing. However, if these biases exist, they likely inhibit testing access in 314 low-income neighborhoods [52, 53] such that the inverse association found between 315 income and positive cases is more pronounced than what the model suggests.",

Further, 320 there is also a significant association between detected COVID-19 cases and low income 321 neighborhoods. The significance of dependents likely comes from the youth rather than 322 the aged population. We suggest further studies be undertaken to determine any 323 underlying causative mechanisms to these associations, paying particular attention to 324 willingness to engage in public health behaviors and to asymptomatic carrier 325 transmission. We finally highlight that whilst predictors may change with increased 326 time and access to testing, this study provides important insights into public health 327 behavior in the early stages of the current, and future, pandemic. The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial 333 or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

Discussion 225 During the opening stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in NYC, there has been 226 considerable variation in detected cases between neighborhoods in the city.

The unprecedented national response has included large 230 number of media stories touting various covariates as predictors of either COVID-19 231 cases or mortality. In this ecological study, we attempted to use spatial modeling 232 techniques to assess the association between number of COVID-19 cases detected in 233 different neighborhoods of NYC and neighborhood-level predictors. Our findings 234 indicated a significant direct association between detected cases and both the 235",
