It remains highly relevant to determine these 51 features experimentally with SARS-CoV-2-specific data, potentially revealing other insights 52 into the biology of this emergent pathogen. To address this, here we describe (i) the first 53 native RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2, detailing the coronaviral transcriptome and proteins (3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8 and 10). The subgenomic mRNAs have a common 5\u2032 leader 65 sequence, near-identical to that located in the 5\u2032-UTR of the viral genome; the transcription 66 mechanism repositions the 5\u2032 leader sequence upstream of ORFs, with each translation 67 start site being located at the primary position for ribosome scanning. These ORFs, although 68 annotated, are yet to be shown as expressed experimentally. Standard sequencing 69 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

These include two 60 large ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1ab, encoded by the complete viral genome and expressed 61 upon cell entry.

Subgenomic mRNAs corresponding to ORF10 are not identifiable in our 116 reads (Supplementary Figure 3). These data suggest that the sequence currently annotated 117 as ORF10 does not have a protein coding function in SARS-CoV-2. Ongoing molecular 118 evolution at this locus should be considered in light of this finding. 119 120 Instead of encoding a protein sequence, the locus annotated as ORF10 immediately 121 upstream of the 3' UTR may act itself or as a precursor of other RNAs in the regulation of 122 gene expression, replication or modulating translation efficiency or cellular antiviral 123 pathways; the 3' UTR of coronaviruses contains domains critical for regulating viral RNA 124 synthesis and other aspects of viral biology [21]. An initial region of the 3' UTR appears 125 essential for viral replication, and an area further 3' includes the stem-loop II-like motif (s2m) 126 a feature conserved in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses [22,23], the s2m having a 127 proposed role in recruiting host translational machinery [24]. A small number of cell culture-128 derived SARS-CoV-2 genomes carry a shared deletion at an area of the 3' UTR including an 129 aspect of the s2m (Supplementary Figure 4), this parallel molecular evolution further 130 suggesting the region may have functional roles in vivo. 131 132 An analysis of transcript breakpoints further illustrates the potential for 5' UTR positions 133 outside of the canonical leader sequence to enable transcript production, with low-frequency 134 non-canonical variations in mRNA splice co-ordinates (Figure 2, Supplementary Figures 5 135 and 6). Low frequency variants may be generated during the preparation of nucleic acids for 136 sequencing, with the rate of chimeric read formation being unknown; this could be explored 137 through analysis of in vitro transcribed RNA control material.138 139 author/funder.
