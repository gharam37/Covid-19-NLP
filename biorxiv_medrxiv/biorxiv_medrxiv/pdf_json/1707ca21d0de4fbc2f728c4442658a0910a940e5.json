It also flags cells with more than two chains, which potentially represent doublets ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ) and may be discarded from downstream analyses. Scirpy defines clonotypes based on the amino-acid or nucleotide sequence of the TCR complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3). The user can choose between defining clonotypes based on sequence identity or similarity. The second approach, inspired by TCRdist (Dash et al. , 2017) , leverages the Parasail library (Daily, 2016) to compute pairwise sequence alignments and identify clusters of T cell clonotypes that likely recognize the same antigens. For building clonotype networks, Scirpy makes use of the sparse-matrix implementation from the scipy package (Virtanen et al. , 2020) , ensuring scalability to hundreds of thousands of cells.",

Single T cells were isolated from tumours, normal adjacent tissue, and peripheral blood of 14 patients with four different cancer types, and subjected to single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing with the 10x technology. Consistently with the original results, we found that the majority of clonotypes were singletons and only 8-19% of patients' clonotypes were clonally expanded ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ) . Our results further confirm that CD8 + effector, effector memory, and tissue resident T cells comprised a large fraction of clonotypes that were expanded in both the tumor and normal tissue, while CD4 + T cells consisted mostly of singletons (Supplementary Fig 3) . Moreover, leveraging Scirpy's capability to define clonotypes based on sequence-similarity rather than identity, we identified clusters of CDR3 amino-acid sequences indicating convergent TCR evolution (Supplementary Fig. 4) .",

Scirpy is highly scalable to big scRNA-seq data and, thus, allows the joint characterization of phenotypes and immune cell receptors in hundreds of thousands of T cells. An extension of Scirpy to characterize \u03b3\u03b4 TCR and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires is planned for the next release. Figure 1 . The Scirpy workflow. After defining clonotypes via CDR3-sequence similarity, scirpy offers a wide range of visualization options to explore clonotype expansion, abundance, and VDJ gene usage. Finally, clonotype information can be integrated with transcriptomic data, leveraging the scanpy workflow. Top panel: Exemplary clonotype network. Each node represents a cell, colored by sample. Edges connect cells belonging to the same clonotype. Middle panel: Clonal expansion of different T cell subsets visualized as bar chart. The bars colored in blue, orange, and green represent the fractions of cells belonging to clonotypes with one, two or more than two cells, respectively. Lower panel: UMAP embedding based on gene expression. Colored dots represent the cells belonging to the most abundant clonotypes.",
