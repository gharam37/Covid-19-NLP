The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is now undergoing extensive scrutiny to understand the routes of transmission and sensitivity in different species. Here, we utilized a unique dataset of 410 vertebrates, including 252 mammals, to study cross-species conservation of ACE2 and its likelihood to function as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor. We designed a five-category ranking score based on the conservation properties of 25 amino acids important for the binding between receptor and virus, classifying all species from very high to very low . Only mammals fell into the medium to very high categories, and only catarrhine primates in the very high category, suggesting that they are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We employed a protein structural analysis to qualitatively assess whether amino acid changes at variable residues would be likely to disrupt ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 binding, and found the number of predicted unfavorable changes significantly correlated with the binding score. Extending this analysis to human population data, we found only rare (<0.1%) variants in 10/25 binding sites. In addition, we observed evidence of positive selection in ACE2 in multiple species, including bats. Utilized appropriately, our results may lead to the identification of intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2, justify the selection of animal models of COVID-19, and assist the conservation of animals both in native habitats and in human care.",

We identified 410 unique vertebrate species with ACE2 orthologs (Dataset S1) that included representatives of all vertebrate taxonomic classes. Among these were 252 mammals, 72 birds, 65 fishes, 17 reptiles and 4 amphibians. Twenty-five amino acids corresponding to known SARS-CoV-2 S-binding residues (11, 13, 21) were examined for their similarity to the residues in human ACE2 (Fig. 1, Dataset S1 ). On the basis of 4 known interactions between specific residues on ACE2 and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S, a set of rules was developed for predicting the likelihood of S binding to ACE2 from each species (see Materials and Methods). Five score categories were predicted: very high , high , medium , low and very low . Results for all species and all SARS-CoV-2 S binding scores are shown in Dataset S1, and results for mammalian species are also shown in Fig. 1 . The very high classification had at least 23/25 ACE2 residues identical to their human homolog and other constraints on substitutions at SARS-CoV-2 S binding hot spots (see Materials and Methods). The 18 species predicted as very high were all Old World primates and apes completely identical to human across the 25 ACE2 binding residues. The ACE2 proteins of 28 species were classified as having a high likelihood of binding the S RBD. Among them are twelve cetaceans, seven rodents, three cervids (deer), three lemuriform primates, two representatives of the order Pilosa (Giant anteater and Southern tamandua), and one Old World primate (Angola colobus, Fig. 1 ).",

We integrated data from six different sources: dbSNP (31) , 1KGP (32) , Topmed (33) , UK10K (34) and CHINAMAP (28) , and identified a total of 11 variants in ten of the 25 ACE2 binding residues (Dataset S2).

Three of the 11 variants were synonymous changes, seven were conservative missense variants, and one, S19P, was a semi-conservative substitution. S19P has the highest allele frequency of the 11 variants, with a global frequency of 0.0003 (17) . We evaluated, by structural homology, six missense variants. Four were neutral and two weakening (E35K, frequency=0.000016; E35D, frequency=0.000279799). S19P was not included in our structural homology assessment, but a recent study predicted it would increase binding affinity (26) .

We next investigated the evolution of ACE2 variation in vertebrates, including how patterns of positive selection compare between bats, a mammalian lineage known to harbor a diversity of coronaviruses (35) , and other mammalian clades. We first inferred the phylogeny of ACE2 using our 410-vertebrate alignment and IQTREE, using the best-fit model of sequence evolution (JTT+F+R7) and rooting the topology on fishes (Dataset S3; Fig. S3 ). We then assayed sequence conservation with PhyloP (36) . The majority of ACE2 codons are significantly conserved across vertebrates and across mammals, likely reflecting its critical function in the renin-angiotensin system (37) (Dataset S4.1), with ten residues in the ACE2 binding domain exceptionally conserved in Chiroptera and/or Rodentia (Dataset S4.2).",

Our study design differs substantially from those studies in several aspects: 1) we analyzed a larger number of primates, carnivores, rodents, cetartiodactyls and other mammalian orders, and an extensive phylogenetic sampling of fishes, birds, amphibians and reptiles; 2) we analyzed the full complement of S-binding residues across the ACE2 binding site, which was based on a consensus set from two independent studies (13, 21) ; 3) we used different methodologies to assess ACE2 binding capacity for SARS-CoV-2 S; and, 4) our study tested for selection and accelerated evolution across the entire ACE2 protein. While our results are strongly consistent with the results and conclusions of Melin and colleagues (44) on the predicted susceptibility of primates to SARS-CoV-2, particularly Old World primates, our work made predictions for a larger number of primates (N=39 vs N=27), bats (N=37 vs N=7), other mammals (N=176 vs N=5) and other vertebrates (N=158 vs N=0). When ACE2 from species in our study were compared with results of other studies there were many consistencies, such as for rodents, but some predictions that differ, such as the relatively high risk described for SARS-CoV-2 binding in pangolin and horse (45) , civet (46) , Rhinolophus sinicus bats (46) and turtles (45) . In one recent study, binding affinity of soluble ACE2 for the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD was analyzed by saturation mutagenesis (26) . Results obtained at each ACE2 binding residue were generally consistent with ours, particularly in the binding hotspot region of ACE2 residues 353-357. Importantly, as compared with other studies, our results greatly expanded the potential number of intermediate hosts and identified many more threatened species that could be infected by SARS-CoV-2 via their ACE2 receptors.",

It has been reported that a captive Malayan tiger was infected by SARS-CoV-2 (9) and that domestic cats, ferrets (47) , rhesus macaques (48) and Syrian golden hamsters (49) are susceptible to experimental infection by SARS-CoV-2. These results agree with our predictions of ACE2 binding ability to SARS-CoV-2 S (Fig. 1 , Dataset S1); 4/5 five species with demonstrated susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 score very high (Rhesus macaque) or medium (domestic cat, tiger and Golden hamster). The only inconsistency was observed for ferrets, which had a low ACE2 binding score. This inconsistency could be related to the high infectivity dose used for experimental infection that likely does not correspond to virus exposure in nature. Dogs have low susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 under experimental conditions (47) , and score low for binding of their ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 S. However, kidney cell lines derived from dog showed ACE2-dependent SARS-CoV-2 S entry, suggesting that in vitro experiments may be overestimating true infectivity potential (39, 50) . Pigs ( low ), ducks ( very low ) and chickens ( very low ) were similarly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and showed no susceptibility (47) , providing further support of our methodology. A recent publication reporting that SARS-CoV-2 could use pig, masked palm civet and Chinese rufous horseshoe bat ACE2 expressed in HeLa cells were inconsistent with our predictions, while data for mouse was in agreement (1) . Indeed, while mouse ACE2 (54, 55) and bottlenose dolphins (56) and are associated with respiratory diseases, the cellular receptor used by these viruses is not known.",

We also predict that many species having a medium score have some risk of infection, and species scored as very low and low are unlikely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 via the ACE2 receptor. Importantly, our predictions are based solely on in silico analyses and must be confirmed by direct experimental data. Until such time, other than for species in which SARS-CoV-2 infection has been demonstrated to occur using ACE2, we urge caution not to over-interpret the predictions made in the present study. This is especially important with regards to species, endangered or otherwise, in human care. While species ranked high or medium may be 14 .",

Signatures of site-specific positive selection in the ACE2 receptor were explored using CODEML, part of the Phylogenetic Analysis using Maximum Likelihood (PAML, (83) ) suite of software. Given CODEML's computational complexity, a smaller subset of mammalian taxa (N=64, Dataset S1), which included species from all prediction categories mentioned above, was used for selection analyses. To calculate likelihood-derived dN/dS rates (\u2375), CODEML utilises both a species tree and a codon alignment. The species tree for all 64 taxa was calculated using IQTREE (80) and the inferred best-fit model of sequence evolution (JTT+F+R4). This gene topology was generally in agreement with the 410 taxa tree, however bats were now sister taxa to Perissodactyla. Therefore all selection analyses were run using both the inferred gene tree, and a modified tree with the position of bats manually modified to reflect the 410 taxa topology. All species trees used were unrooted. A codon alignment of the 64 mammals was generated using pal2nal (84) with protein alignments generated with Clustal Omega (73) and their respective CDS sequences.",

The program phyloP was then used to identify codons undergoing accelerated or conserved evolution relative to the neutral model using --features to specify codons, --method LRT --mode CONACC, and --subtree for lineage-specific tests, with p-values thus assigned per codon based on a likelihood ratio test. P-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (36) and sites with a corrected p-value less than 0.05 were considered significant.

Almost 10% of codons (N=73; 9 near the RBD) are accelerated within mammals (Dataset S4.1, 4.5), and 18 of these have BEB scores greater than 0.95, indicating positively selected residues (Dataset S4.5, 4.6, Fig. S4). Nineteen accelerated residues, including two positively-selected codons (Q24, H34), are critical for the binding of the ACE2 RBD and SARS-CoV-2 S (Dataset S4.5; Fig. 3; Fig. S5). Q24 has not been observed to be polymorphic within the human population, and H34 harbors a synonymous polymorphism (AF=0.00063) but no non-synonymous polymorphisms (Dataset S2). This pattern of acceleration and positive selection in ACE2 also holds for individual mammalian lineages. Using CODEML, positive selection was detected within the orders Chiroptera (LRT=346.40, \u2375=3.44 p<0.001), Cetartiodactyla (LRT=92.86, \u2375=3.83, p<0.001), Carnivora (LRT=65.66, \u2375=2.27. p<0.001), Primates (LRT=72.33, \u2375=3.16, p<0.001) and Rodentia (LRT=91.26, \u2375=1.77, p<0.001). Overall, bats had more positively selected sites with significant BEB scores (29 sites in Chiroptera compared to 10, 8, 7 and 15 sites in Cetartiodactyla, Carnivora, Primates and Rodentia, respectively). Positive selection at key sitesfor the binding of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 was only found in the bat-specific alignment. PhyloP was used to assess shifts in evolutionary rate within mammalian lineages, for each assessing signal relative to a neutral model trained on species from the specified lineage (Dataset S4.6-11,Fig. S6).

            "text": "Bats and other species of interest . Chiroptera (bats) represent a clade of mammals that are of high interest in COVID-19 research because several bat species are known to harbor coronaviruses, including those most closely related to the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (1) . We analyzed ACE2 from 37 bat species of which 8 and 29 scored low and very low , respectively. These results were unexpected because the three Rhinolophus spp. including the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat are major suspects in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, or a closely related virus, to humans (1) . Globally, bats have been shown to harbour the highest diversity of betacoronaviruses in mammals tested(35) and show little pathology carrying these viruses(57) . We found evidence for accelerated evolution at six RBD binding domain residues within the bat lineage, which is more than in any other lineage tested. Bats also had far more sites showing evidence of positive selection, including four binding domain residues, compared to other mammalian orders. This suggests that the diversity observed in bat ACE2 sequences may be driven by selective pressure from coronaviruses. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not likely to use the ACE2 receptor in bats, which challenges a recent study showing that SARS-CoV-2 can infect HeLa cellsexpressing Rhinolophus sinicus ACE2 (1) . If bats can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus likely uses a different receptor. For example, the MERS-CoV, a betacoronavirus, uses CD26/DPP4 (16) while the porcine transmissible enteritis virus, an alphacoronavirus uses aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) (58) . As detailed above, further in vitro and in vivo infectivity studies are required to fully understand the mode of transmission of susceptibility of bats to SARS-CoV-2.Carnivores . Recent reports of a Malayan tiger and a domestic cat infected by SARS-CoV-2 suggest that the virus can be transmitted to other felids(9,47) . Our results are consistent with these studies; 9/9 felids we analyzed scored medium for ACE2 binding of SARS-CoV-2 S. However, the masked palm civet ( Paguma larvata ), a member of the Viverridae family that is related to but distinct from Felidae, scored as very low . These results are inconsistent with transfection studies using civet ACE2 receptors expressed in HeLa cells(1) , although these experiments have limitations as discussed above. While",

            "text": "so no conclusions can be drawn.Pangolins . Considerable controversy surrounds reports that pangolins can serve as an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2. Pangolins were proposed as a possible intermediate host(22) and have been shown to harbor related coronaviruses. In our study, ACE2 of Chinese pangolin ( Manis pentadactyla ), Sunda pangolin ( Manis javanica ), and white bellied pangolin ( Phataginus tricuspis ) had low or very low binding score for SARS-CoV-2 S. Neither experimental infection nor in vitro infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been reported for pangolins. As for ferrets and bats, if SARS-CoV-2 infects pangolins it may be using a receptor other than ACE2, based on our analysis.Other vertebrates . Our analysis of 29 orders of fishes, 29 orders of birds, 3 orders of reptiles and 2 orders of amphibians predicts that the ACE2 proteins of species within these vertebrate classes are not likely to bind SARS-CoV-2 S. Thus, vertebrate classes other than mammals are not likely to be an intermediate host or reservoir for the virus, despite predictions reported in a recent study (45) , unless SARS-CoV-2 can use another receptor for infection. With many different non-mammal vertebrates sold in the seafood and wildlife markets of Asia and elsewhere, it is still important to determine if SARS-CoV-2 can be found in non-mammalian vertebrates. Relevance to Threatened Species . Among the 103 species that scored very high , high and medium for ACE2 SARS-CoV-2 S RBD binding, 41 (40%) are classified in one of three 'Threatened' categories ( Vulnerable , Endangered , and Critically Endangered ) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, five are classified as Near Threatened , and two species are classified as Extinct in the Wild (Dataset S1) (60) . This represents only a small fraction of the threatened species potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. For example, all 20 catarrhine primate species in our analysis, representing three families (Cercopithecidae, Hylobatidae, and Hominidae) scored very high , suggesting that all 185 species of catarrhine primates, most of which are classified Threatened (62), are potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, all three species of deer, representatives of a family of ~92 species (Cervidae), scored as high risk, as did species representing Cetacea (baleen and toothed whales), and both groups contain a number of threatened species. Toothed whales have potential for viral outbreaks and have lost function of a gene key to the antiviral response in other mammalian lineages (61) . If they are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 , human-to-animal transmission could pose a risk through sewage outfall (62) and contaminated refuse from cities, commercial vessels and cruise liners (63) . In contrast, some threatened species scored low or very low , such as the giant panda ( low ), potentially positive news for these at risk populations. have practical implications for populations of threatened species in the wild and those under human care (including those in zoos). Established guidelines for minimizing potential human to animal transmission should be implemented and strictly followed. Guidelines for field researchers working on great apes established by the IUCN have been in place since 2015 in response to previous human disease outbreaks (64) and have received renewed attention because of SARS-CoV-2 (64-66) . For zoos, guidelines in response to SARS-CoV-2 have been distributed by several Taxon Advisory Groups of the North American Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians (AAZV), and the European Association of Zoo and Wildlife Veterinarians (EAZWV), and these organizations are actively monitoring and updating knowledge of species in human care considered to be potentially sensitive to infection (67, 68) . Although in silico studies suggest potential susceptibility of diverse species, verification of infection potential is warranted, using cell cultures, stem cells, organoids, and other methods that do not require direct animal infection studies. Zoos and other facilities that maintain living animal collections are in a position to provide such samples for generating crucial research resources by banking tissues, and cryobanking viable cell cultures in support of these efforts.",
