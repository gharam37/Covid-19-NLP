We note that RmYN02 is not informative about the nature of 2 this event as it harbors a long and divergent haplotype in this region, possibly associated with 3 another independent recombination event with more distantly related viral strains (Fig. 2E ). The 4 other four sequences are all highly, and approximately equally, divergent from RmYN02 in this 5 large region (Fig. 2E) , suggesting that the RmYN02 strain obtained a divergent haplotype from 6 the recombination event. When BLAST searching using 100-bp windows along the RmYN02 7 genome, we find no single viral genome as the top hit, instead the top hits are found We investigate this issue using estimates of synonymous divergence per synonymous site (d S ) 20 in sliding windows of 300 bp. However, estimation of d S is complicated by the high levels of 21 divergence and extremely skewed nucleotide content in the 3rd position of the sequences 22 (Table 1) which will cause a high degree of homoplasy. We, therefore, entertain methods for 23 estimation that explicitly account for unequal nucleotide content and multiple hits in the same 24 site such as maximum likelihood methods and the YN00 method . 25",

Taking into account that RaTG13 was isolated July 2013, we find an 2 estimated tMRCA between that strain and SARS-CoV-2 of =(96.92 +6.5)/2 = 51.71 years. A consequence of the skewed nucleotide frequencies is a high degree of homoplasy in 13 synonymous sites that challenges estimates of d S . We here evaluated estimators of d S in 300 bp 14 sliding windows and found that a bias-corrected version of the maximum likelihood estimator 15 tended to perform best for values of d S < 2. We used this estimator to investigate the 16 relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses in sliding windows. We show that 17 1 closely related to SARS-CoV-2. In any case, the 3SEQ analyses presented provides further 2 support for the recombination hypothesis. However, we also find that the synonymous 3 divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin viruses in this region is relatively high, 4 suggesting that the recombination was into RaTG13 from an unknown strain, rather than 5 between pangolin viruses and SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with the hypothesis proposed 6 by Boni, et al. 2020, and we can exclude the possibility of a very recent recombination event 7 between pangolins and SARS-CoV-2. Another alternative explanation is that there is a 8 mutational hotspot located in the RBD region. While it is possible that selection may have 9 favored hypermutability in this domain, the most parsimonious explanation at the moment, in the 10 absence of knowledge of molecular mechanisms to explain such a hotspot, is recombination 11 into the RaTG13 strain. To fully distinguish between these hypotheses, additional strains would 12 have to be discovered that either are candidates for introgression into RaTG13 or can break up 13 the lineage in the phylogenetic tree between pangolin viruses and RaTG13. 14 The fact that synonymous divergence to the outgroups, RaTG13 and RmYN02, is not 15 fully saturated, provides an opportunity for a number of different analyses. First, we can date the 16 time of the divergence between the bat viruses and SARS-CoV-2 using synonymous mutations 17 estimates of d S given in Table 3 in general are highly compatible with a constant molecular  1 clock. 2",

RmYN02 has 5 previously been reported to have disconcordant levels of divergence to SARS-CoV-2 in different 6 parts of the genome, presumably as a result of recombination. To illustrate this, we performed 7recombination analyses with 3SEQ (Lam, et al. 2018) across the five viral genomes and 8 identified several recombination regions affecting RmYN02 (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Table 5). 9 Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2) in genome region with all recombination tracts (Supplementary 10 Table 5) masked using Maximum-likelihood tree (Fig. 2A) and Neighbor-joining tree based on 11 synonymous (Fig. 2B) or non-synoymous (Fig. 2C) mutation distance metrics consistently 12 support RmYN02 as the nearest outgroup to human SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to previous 13 analyses before the discovery of RmYN02, which instead found RaTG13 to be the nearest 14 outgroup (Lam, et al. 2020; Zhou, Yang, et al. 2020). This observation is also consistent with the 15 genome-wide phylogeny constructed in Zhou et al (Zhou, et al. 2020). 16We plot the overall sequence similarity (% nucleotides identical) between SARS-CoV-2 17 and the four other strains analyzed in windows of 300 bp(Fig. 1). Notice that the divergence 18 between human SARS-CoV-2 and the bat viral sequences, RaTG13 and RmYN02, in most 19 regions of the genome, is quite low compared to the other comparisons. A notable exception is 20 the suspected recombination region in RmYN02 that has an unusual high level of divergence 21 with all other viruses(Fig. 2E). However, there is also another exception: a narrow window in 22 the RBD of the S gene where the divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and GD410721 is 23 moderate and the divergences between GD410721 and both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are 24 quite high and show very similar pattern.

The variance in the estimate in d S is small and the uncertainty 7 is mostly dominated by the uncertainty in the estimate of the mutation rate. We estimate the 8 S.D. in using 1000 parametric simulations, using the ML estimates of all parameters, for both 9 RaTG13 vs. SARS-CoV-2 and for RmYN02 vs. SARS-CoV-2, and for each simulated data also 10 simulating values of and from normal distributions with mean 1.04\u00d710 -3 and S.D. 0.18\u00d710 -3 , 11 and mean 0.5604 and S.D. 0.1122, respectively.

Alternatively, skewed distribution of nucleotide frequencies in synonymous sites in SARS-CoV-6 2 (Kandeel, et al. 2020), along with high divergence, complicates the estimation of synonymous 7 divergence in SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses. In particular, in the third codon position the 8 nucleotide frequency of T is 43.5% while it is just 15.7% for C. This resulting codon usage is not 9 optimized for mammalian cells (e.g, Chamary, et al. 2006).
