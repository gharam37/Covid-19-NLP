Roughly half of the world population has been asked to work from home and practice social distancing as the search for a vaccine continues. Though government interventions such as lockdown and social distancing are theoretically useful, its debatable whether such interventions are effective in flattening the curve, which is ceasing or reducing the growth of infection in control populations. In this article, I present a simple power law model that enables a comparison of countries in time windows of 14 days since first coronavirus related death is reported in that country. It therefore provides means to access the efficacy of above interventions.",

Since the pandemic control is an ongoing effort, many of these models provide either an optimistic or a pessimistic picture. Nonetheless, such models are useful for government bodies to plan interventions and other measures to curb the disease. For instance, air travel restrictions between most affected countries came into existence by the middle of March'2020. Inbounds travelers from high risk countries usually went through thermal screening at the airport, followed by strict isolation of symptomatic and quarantine for asymptomatic travelers. Further, most countries have adopted strategies to encourage social distancing in several phases, e.g., (1) educating .
