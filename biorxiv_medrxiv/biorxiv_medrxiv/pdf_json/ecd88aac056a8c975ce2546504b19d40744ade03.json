Clinical practice has demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 specific antibodies and viral antigens can be used as diagnostic and prognostic markers of COVID-19. However, the popular point-of-care biomarker detection technologies, such as the lateral-flow test strips, provide only yes/no information and have very limited sensitivities. Thus, it has a high false negative rate and cannot be used for the quantitative evaluation of patient's immune response. Conventional ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), on the other hand, can provide quantitative, accurate, and sensitive results, but it involves complicated and expensive instruments and long assay time. In addition, samples need to be sent to centralized labs, which significantly increases the turn-around time. Here, we present a microfluidic ELISA technology for rapid (15-20 minutes), quantitative, sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 biomarkers using SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and viral antigen -S protein in serum. We also characterized various humanized monoclonal IgG, and identified a candidate with a high binding affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein that can serve as the calibration standard of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG in serological analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our microfluidic ELISA platform can be used for rapid affinity evaluation of monoclonal anti-S1 antibodies. The microfluidic ELISA device is highly portable and requires less than 10 \uf06dL of samples for each channel. Therefore, our technology will greatly facilitate rapid and quantitative analysis of COVID-19 patients and vaccine recipients at point-of-care. author/funder. All rights reserved.

            "text": "The disease (COVID-19) related to novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused tens of thousands of deaths and is becoming a severe threat to global health. However, diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 are still facing serious challenges. The current \"gold standard\" method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on the detection of viral RNA (N gene) in nasal swab samples with RT-PCR. However, PCR-based diagnosis is prone to false negatives due to the uncertainties in sample collection and the molecular mechanism of the test and is unable to track the immune response to the viral infection 1 . Earlier SARS-CoV related research 2, 3 and most recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 4, 5 have shown that SARS-specific antibodies, such as IgG, IgM, and IgA, can be detected in serum as early as seven days after viral infection (3-5 days after the symptoms appear) and can last for several years after recovery 1 . Similar immune response should also occur after a successful vaccination (>7 days after vaccination) 2, 3, 6 . Therefore, virus-specific antibodies in serum and secretory mucus (e.g., saliva and sputum) can be used as diagnostic markers for viral infection and for the evaluation of patient's adaptive immune responses (either from virus infection or from vaccination). As such, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies are currently listed among the diagnostic markers in the \"COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Provisional 7 th Edition)\" published in China. In addition to SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, the viral antigen (such as the spike protein or S protein) in circulating blood can be used for the prognosis of COVID-19-related viremia 1, 7 . As one of the most commonly used targets for vaccine development, the serum concentration of the S protein is also a potential marker for early-stage vaccine responses, especially for sub-unit vaccines 8 .",

For D001 and D006, the signal for both types of S1 proteins is very similar, indicating that the antibodies' binding affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 S1 and SARS-CoV S1 should be very similar (D006 may have a slightly higher affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 S1 than SARS-CoV S1).

As a negative control, a human IgG isotype does not generate any detectable signal within the entire range of detection (0.7-4800 ng/mL).

The remaining two antibodies, D001 and D006, are nearly the same in terms of the dynamic range and affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 S1.

Same as in the IgG detection experiment, recombinant S1 proteins were first immobilized on the supporting surface (2 \u00b5g/mL), followed by the binding of IgG. To reduce potential sources of errors, we directly conjugated HRP molecule with purified IgG molecules (molar ratio IgG : HRP = 1 : 4, with the HRP conjugation kit from Abcam). The antibodies were then diluted to six different concentrations (1000 -1 ng/mL with 4\u00d7 serial dilution) and then applied to the S1 protein-coated ELISA reactors. The immobilized IgG can be quantified after a short 6 minutes of incubation and 4 times of rinsing. Although the antibodies may not reach equilibrium by the end of the incubation, the quantity of the immobilized antibody (also the signal intensity) should still have a positive correlation with the affinity of the antibody.",

            "text": "To compare the antibody's affinity towards the S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, we performed a side-by-side experiment for all antibodies under test 30 . The antibodies were CR3022, D001, D006, and D003. The first three antibodies were used as calibration standards in the IgG detection experiments and D003 was used as the detection antibody in the S1 detection experiments. Thanks to the simple protocol, our assay exhibits excellent intra-assay consistencies (see Fig. S4 as an example), thus ensuring highly reliable measurements. As shown in Figure 4 (B), these four antibodies have very different affinities towards the S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2. Note that the data for 1 ng/mL are not presented because the signal is not detectable for the three antibodies except D003 (the signal for D003 is very weak, see Figure S4 ). For the points within the linear dynamic ranges, the signal intensities with the strongest antibody (D003) are 6 -10 times higher than the weakest antibody (CR3022). For example, the signal intensities for these two antibodies at 250 ng/mL are 612 and 75.9, respectively. On the other hand, the lowest detectable concentration for D003 is 1 ng/mL and the lowest detectable concentration for CR3022 is 16 ng/mL. This can be another evidence for the difference in antibody's affinity.

We also successfully characterized different antibodies and identified an antibody candidate, D006, which can be used as the calibration antibody for quantitative evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG. This approach can also be extended to evaluation of therapeutic convalescent plasma. Furthermore, we demonstrated sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein (antigen) with the LLOD of 0.4 ng/mL. Finally, we showed that our technology can be used as an alternative approach for rapid (8.5 minutes) screening and validation of monoclonal anti-S1 antibodies.
