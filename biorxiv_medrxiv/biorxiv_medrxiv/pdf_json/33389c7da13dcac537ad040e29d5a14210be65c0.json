It is likely different countries and populations respond differently to the same NPIs and that these differences are reflected in the epidemic development. Here, we model the impact of the changes in mobility patterns in 11 European countries by estimating the effect of these on the basic reproductive number, R 0 , in a Bayesian framework. By modelling changes in R 0 with real-life mobility data, the true effects of responses to NPIs across different countries can be modelled more accurately. We assume the impact of each mobility change has the same relative impact across all countries and across time. We utilize mobility data from Google mobility reports using five different categories: retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, transit stations, workplace and residential. The changes in mobility have a large overlap with the introduction of governmental NPIs, highlighting the importance of government action for population behavioural change. The importance of each mobility category for predicting changes in R 0 is estimated through the model. The grocery and pharmacy parameter is estimated to account for above 90 % of the reduction in R0 with a very narrow confidence interval. The model predicts that immediately after the NPIs, R 0 rose in several countries as activities in grocery and pharmacy increased, but then it dropped sharply as those activities decreased. We do see worrying patterns in northern Europe as predicted values of R 0 are still clearly above 1.0 there, in particular in Sweden with an R 0 of 2.27.",

China implemented a quick strategy of suppression by locking the Wuhan province down (23d of January) and implementing social distancing procedures nationwide, with a successful outcome (Li et al. 2020) . Still, the virus rapidly spread across the world through our increasingly interconnected flight network, and shortly arrived in Europe. To limit the spread of the virus, European countries introduced non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) similar to China's. These NPIs include social distancing, school closures, limiting international travel and lockdown (ECDC 25 March 2020) . All of these NPIs result in behavioural changes, which can be traced through mobility data.",

Further, UK, Switzerland and Austria also seem to have R 0 clearly below 1 and Germany just below 1.
