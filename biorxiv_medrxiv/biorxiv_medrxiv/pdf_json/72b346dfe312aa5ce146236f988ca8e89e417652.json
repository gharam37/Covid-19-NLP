A multitude of research efforts worldwide aim at characterizing the cellular factors involved in viral transmission in order to reveal therapeutic targets. For a full understanding of the susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cell type-specific expression of the host cell surface receptor is necessary. The key protein suggested to be involved in host cell entry is Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and its expression has been reported in various human organs, in some cases with inconsistent or contradictory results. Here, we aim to verify a reliable expression profile of ACE2 in all major human tissues and cell types. Based on stringently validated immunohistochemical analysis and highthroughput mRNA sequencing from several datasets, we found that ACE2 expression is mainly localized to microvilli of the intestinal tract and renal proximal tubules, gallbladder epithelium, testicular Sertoli cells and Leydig cells, glandular cells of seminal vesicle and cardiomyocytes. The expression in several other previously reported locations, including alveolar type II (AT2) cells, could not be confirmed. Furthermore, ACE2 expression was absent in the AT2 lung carcinoma cell line A549, often used as a model for viral replication studies. Our analysis suggests that the expression of ACE2 in the human respiratory system appears to be limited, and the expression of the receptor in lung or respiratory epithelia on the protein level is yet to be confirmed. This raises questions regarding the role of ACE2 for infection of human lungs and highlights the need to further explore the route of transmission during SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

No or low expression of ACE2 was observed in human lung. By the introduction of microarray analysis, whole-body maps quantifying global gene expression patterns based on mRNA transcripts were launched, such as BioGPS 5 , soon followed by several large-scale transcriptomics efforts based on next-generation sequencing in samples representing most major human organs and tissues. Three such recent initiatives include the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) consortium 6 and the genome-based tissue expression (GTEx) consortium 7 based on RNA-seq, and the FANTOM5 consortium based on cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) 8 . The HPA consortium aims at characterizing the entire human proteome in tissues, organs, cells and organelles using a combination of transcriptomics and antibody-based proteomics. In the open-access database www.proteinatlas.org, expression profiles based on both external and internal datasets are shown, together with primary data, criteria used for validation and original high-resolution images of immunohistochemically stained human tissue samples. The HPA displays mRNA expression data from HPA, GTEx and FANTOM5, and also summarizes the three datasets as normalized expression levels (NX) across 37 tissues and organs covering all major parts of the human body, including human blood 9, 10 . The consensus of these three datasets show medium or high expression levels in kidney, testis and the intestinal tract, together with low expression in heart and adipose tissue and lack of expression in most other normal organs, including lung ( Figure 1 ).",

Complementing the transcriptomics data with immunohistochemistry not only gives the possibility to define protein localization in different compartments at a single-cell level, but also provides important spatial information in the context of neighboring cells in intact tissue samples. Furthermore, the combination of transcriptomics with proteomics provides an advantageous strategy for studying the functional representation of the human genome. A previous immunohistochemistry study by Hamming et al 11 analyzing ACE2 across a large set of human samples, showed staining in most tissue types examined ( Figure 1 ). Abundant immunoreactivity was displayed in microvilli of small intestine and proximal tubules of kidney, in line with all mRNA expression datasets, but strong positivity was also found in several other organs, including the respiratory system, oral mucosa and skin. While this is partly consistent with transcriptomics data from microarray experiments 5 , the findings are contradictory to all three more recent mRNA expression datasets. In the respiratory system, both alveolar epithelial AT1 and AT2 cells, and epithelial cells of nasopharynx were distinctly stained. The authors also presented a consistent abundant expression of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and adipocytes of all examined tissues, despite the fact that several of the corresponding organs that normally contain high fractions of such stromal and mesenchymal cells had low or absent mRNA levels. The immunohistochemical analysis by Hamming et al was based on a single antibody, quality ensured using three different criteria: 1) incubation of control sections with anti-ACE2 antibody solutions pre-incubated with the synthetic peptide to which the antibody was raised, 2) incubation of control sections with unrelated rabbit polyclonal antibodies, and 3) incubation with PBS instead of primary antibody. All three control sections were negative for immunohistochemistry, however, these methods for validation still do not prove that the antibody is specific for endogenous ACE2 in formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissue samples. The antibody thus does not meet the criteria for enhanced validation proposed by the International Working Group for Antibody Validation (IWGAV), formed with representatives from several major academic institutions 12 . IWGAV proposed five different pillars to be used for antibody validation to ensure reproducibility of antibody-based studies and promote stringent strategies for validation. To ensure that an antibody binds to the intended protein target, it is necessary that the validation has been performed in an application-specific manner, using at least one of the strategies suggested by IWGAV.",

The antibodies used in the HPA program for the immunohistochemical analysis of ACE2 have passed several of the criteria for enhanced antibody validation. The protein expression levels of two different antibodies showed high correlations with mRNA expression levels from three different datasets (HPA, GTEx and FANTOM5), thereby validating the antibodies using an orthogonal method. Furthermore, the cell type-specific localization of the protein expression across 78 different cell types was similar between the two independent antibodies. Of all 78 cell types evaluated, reliable expression was only observed in 10 cell types: microvilli of the duodenum, small intestine, colon and rectum, renal proximal tubules, in gallbladder epithelium, testicular Sertoli cells and Leydig cells, a subset of glandular cells in seminal vesicle, and in cardiomyocytes. (Figure 2 ). The cardiomyocyte staining was more diffuse and mainly cytoplasmic, while all other positive locations were as expected more prominent towards the plasma membrane. One antibody also showed positivity in a subset of apical membranes in liver bile ducts, while the other antibody was consistently negative in bile ducts of all three individuals. Due to the discrepancy between the antibodies, the staining in bile ducts for one of the antibodies should therefore be interpreted with caution, as it may represent off-target binding. No distinct expression confirmed by both antibodies could be found in any of the other analyzed cell types, including epithelial cells of the respiratory system, blood vessel endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. This immunohistochemistry analysis suggests a much more limited expression of the ACE2 in human tissues than previously suggested 11 , and the present body-wide expression profile shows a high correlation to different mRNA expression datasets.",

This new platform for single cell analysis constitutes an important complement to the in situ localization by immunohistochemistry and thus provides an excellent tool in studies of transcript levels expected to be found in smaller subsets of cells in complex tissue samples. The data for ACE2 from multiple scRNA-seq datasets in human respiratory tract are however inconclusive. In Figure 3 , a summary of ACE2 expression in human lung based on three different publicly available scRNA-seq datasets is provided [16] [17] [18] with the transcriptomics expression in single cells of ACE2 and the surfactant protein SFTPA1. The data in all three datasets reveal that only a small fraction of the cells in lung express ACE2 at a low level, in contrast to the abundant expression of the surfactant protein in clusters representing AT2 cells. This is in contrast to other studies suggesting an enrichment in AT2 cells, although it should be noted that expression was often identified only in a very small fractions of the AT2 cells, often less than 1% 19, 20 . There are also other studies concluding that the ACE2 expression is considerably higher in other cells of the respiratory tract, such as ciliated or secretory cells 21, 22 , or in squamous epithelial cells of oral mucosa or esophagus 23, 24 . Similarly, in the recently published Human Cell Landscape (HCL) 16 , the expression levels of ACE2 were highest in cell types supporting the data from antibody-based immunohistochemistry from the HPA program, including jejunal and duodenal enterocytes, gallbladder epithelial cells, renal proximal tubules and testicular Sertoli cells. In the three samples from adult lung, the expression level was low, and no elevated expression was observed in AT2 cells as compared to secretory cells, macrophages or fibroblasts. In summary, the data from single cell transcriptomics studies reported here (Figure 3 ) supports the conclusion from the antibody-based immunohistochemistry analysis described above, suggesting that there are no or very low detectable protein levels of ACE2 in the lung.",

The most commonly used cell line in such studies is A549, derived from an alveolar epithelial AT2 cell lung carcinoma 25 . To explore which cell lines that may be suitable experimental models for analysis of ACE2, we analyzed the expression levels based on RNA-seq in 64 different cell lines, as part of the Cell Atlas in the HPA 26 . Interestingly, the expression levels of ACE2 were below cut-off in all three cell lines derived from human lung, including A549, the immortalized bronchial epithelial cell line HBEC-KT, and the small cell lung carcinoma cell line SCLC-21H. The expression levels were below cutoff also in most other cell lines, however, low expression (<5 NX) was found in BEWO (metastatic choriocarcinoma), HaCaT (keratinocytes), Hep G2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), NB-4 (acute promyelocytic leukemia), RPMI-8226 (multiple myeloma), RT4 (urinary bladder) and SH-SY5Y (neuroblastoma). This suggests that none of the lung cell lines are appropriate models for studying the role of ACE2 in the human respiratory system. In the previous immunohistochemistry study by Hamming et al, the positivity of ACE2 in cells from A549 was presented as a confirmation of expression in AT2 cells. Due to the lack of expression on ACE2 in A549 on the mRNA level and the fact that the same study suggested expression in multiple other tissue locations neither confirmed by mRNA levels or by well-validated antibodies in the present investigation, it is therefore likely that the previously published positivity of ACE2 in A549 was due to off-target binding.",

No reliable data confirms protein level expression of ACE2 in AT2 cells, previously shown to harbor ACE2.

Further studies are needed to explore the potential involvement of ACE2 in the manifestation of symptoms related to these organs as a result of COVID-19 disease. In addition to respiratory symptoms, the closely related SARS-CoV that caused the SARS outbreak was shown to also cause diarrhea, impaired liver function and elevation of non-cardiac creatine kinase, suggesting tropism of the virus to other organs well in line with the tissues showing the highest expression levels of ACE2. Interestingly, in a recent study on pediatric COVID-19 individuals, eight out of 10 cases showed rectal swabs positive for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the gastrointestinal tract may shed virus and that fecal-oral transmission may be a possible route for infection 27 . It should also be noted that the prerequisites of the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 attachment pattern to human cell surface receptors and COVID-19 disease progression are multifactorial, including not only the binding of the virus to the target cells, but also other factors such as the host's immune system and the total virus load.

In short, representative 1 mm diameter cores were sampled from FFPE blocks and assembled into an array of normal tissue samples, corresponding to a toal of 144 individuals. TMA blocks were cut in 4 \u00b5m sections using a waterfall microtome (Microm H355S, ThermoFisher Scientific, Freemont, CA), placed on SuperFrost Plus slides (ThermoFisher Scientific, Freemont, CA), dried overnight at room temperature (RT), and then baked at 50\u00b0C for at least 12 h. Automated immunohistochemistry was performed by using Lab Vision Autostainer 480S Module (ThermoFisher Scientific, Freemont, CA), as described in detail previously 28 . Primary antibodies against human ACE2 were the polyclonal rabbit IgG antibody HPA000288 (Atlas Antibodies AB, Sweden) and monoclonal mouse IgG antibody CAB026174 (cat # MAB933 Human ACE-2 antibody, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The antibodies were diluted and optimized based on IWGAV criteria for antibody validation 12 . Protocol optimization was performed on a test TMA containing 20 different normal tissues. The stained slides were digitalized with ScanScope AT2 (Leica Aperio, Vista, CA) using a 20x objective. The tissue cores were manually annotated by certified pathologists (Lab SurgPath, Mumbai, India), and curated by a second observer. Annotation parameters included staining intensity, quantity of positive cells and subcellular localization in 78 different normal cell types.
