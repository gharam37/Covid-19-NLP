Here we introduce a simplified CUT&Tag method that can be performed at home to help ameliorate the interruption of bench research caused by COVID-19 physical distancing requirements. All steps beginning with frozen nuclei are performed in single PCR tubes through to barcoded library amplication and cleanup, ready for pooling and DNA sequencing. Our CUT&Tag@home protocol has minimal equipment, reagent and supply needs and does not require handling of toxic or biologically active materials. We show that data quality and reproducibility for samples down to ~100 nuclei compare favorably to datasets produced using lab-based CUT&Tag and other chromatin profiling methods. We use CUT&Tag@home with antibodies to trimethylated histone H3 lysine-4, -36, -27 and -9 to comprehensively profile the epigenome of human K562 cells, consisting respectively of active gene regulatory elements, transcribed gene bodies, developmentally silenced domains and constitutively silenced parasitic elements.",

A variety of chromatin features mark sites of transcriptional regulatory elements and regions of activation and silencing that differ between cell types and change during development and disease progression. The mapping of chromatin features genome-wide has traditionally been performed using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), in which chromatin is cross-linked and solubilized and an antibody to a protein or modification of interest is used to immunoprecipitate the bound DNA (Rodriguez-Ubreva and Ballestar, 2014) . However, alternative chromatin profiling methods based on enzyme tethering in situ have recently gained in popularity.",

Activation of MNase with Ca ++ results in targeted cleavage releasing the antibody-bound fragment into the supernatant for paired-end DNA sequencing. The low backgrounds resulting from antibody-tethered cleavage and release reduce cell numbers and sequencing depths required to map chromatin features relative to ChIP-seq, and CUT&RUN is now becoming a standard tool for mapping transcription factors and other chromatin features (Hainer et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018; Oomen et al., 2019; Roth et al., 2018) .",

In CUT&Tag, DNA purification is followed by PCR amplification, eliminating the end-polishing and ligation steps required for sequencing library preparation in CUT&RUN. Like CUT&RUN, CUT&Tag requires relatively little input material, and the low backgrounds permit low sequencing depths to sensitively map chromatin features. Because integrated pA-Tn5 is not released following the tagmentation reaction, CUT&Tag and related methods are suitable for single-cell profiling, in which all steps through tagmentation are performed in a single in situ reaction, after which single cells or nuclei are dispensed for barcoding PCR amplification.",

CUT&Tag has improved signal-to-noise for histone marks, at least in part because an antibody-tethered Tn5 integrates its mosaic-end adapters and remains bound during the incubation (Kaya-Okur et al., 2019) . We also found that CUT&Tag is somewhat more efficient than CUT&RUN, likely because integration by targeted Tn5 is more efficient than enzymatic end-polishing and ligation in traditional library preparation steps.",

During the COVID-19 physical distancing restrictions in Seattle we performed CUT&Tag@home for 16-32 samples per day with uniformly high quality for chromatin marks of active regulatory elements, gene bodies, Polycomb-silenced regions and constitutive heterochromatin.

Our simplified protocol applies to any chromatin feature for which an antibody is available and should be adaptable to any cell type for which there is a standard nuclei isolation protocol. In brief, native or lightly cross-linked nuclei are prepared and immobilized on magnetic beads. Beads are incubated with a primary antibody followed by incubation with a secondary antibody to increase the number of IgG molecules at each epitope bound by the primary antibody. Beads are washed and incubated with protein A-Tn5 loaded with mosaic-end adapters and washed under stringent conditions. Tn5 is activated by addition of Mg 2+ , a \"one-and-done\" reaction in that the pA-Tn5 transposome is not active once it integrates its adapters. DNA is released in a small volume of SDS and then mixed with Triton-X100 to neutralize the SDS. Samples are enriched by PCR amplification and a single Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization (SPRI) magnetic bead cleanup step. Up to 48 barcoded libraries from multiple experiments may be pooled for each lane of a 2-lane flow cell, as 3 million mapped paired-end reads are usually sufficient for a genome-wide profile of a histone modification in human cells. CUT&Tag@home is performed on frozen nuclei using non-toxic materials, and has minimal equipment requirements, so that it can be conveniently performed in a utility area on ~1.5 meters of counter space (Figure 2) .",

To ascertain the generality of the observation, we extracted 20-kb segments centered over the middle of each ERV from the H3 lysine trimethylation tracks over Chromosome 1, which harbors 50,707 of the 695,067 human ERVs, from the UCSC Repeat Masker file. We stacked the segments ordered by decreasing length of the ERV (Fig. 7b) . For H3K4me3, H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 we observed essentially no signal over these elements, whereas for H3K9me3 we observed signal over elements of all sizes, including a cluster of heavily H3K9me3-marked ERV fragments spanning ~2 kb in length. This observation is consistent with studies showing that intact and active ERVs are among the most heavily H3K9me3-methylated elements in mammalian genomes (Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2014; Ohtani et al., 2018; Walter et al., 2016) . To determine whether there are any differences among the ERV families in the propensity for gaining H3K9 trimethylation, we performed unsupervised k-means clustering over a \u00b11 kb span on the full set of Chromosome 1 ERVs (k=3). Cluster I comprises 5,536 heavily H3K9trimethylated ERVs (11%) and Cluster III comprises 31,177 ERVs (62%) with background levels of H3K9 trimethylation (Fig 7b, rightmost panel) . Among the ERV families, ERVK, which accounts for 8% of the total human ERVs, was on average 2.8-fold more highly represented in Cluster I relative to Cluster III (186:382) than were all other ERVs (5350:30795). The ERVK family is the youngest and most intact of the human endogenous retrovirus families (Hanke et al., 2016) , and in the mouse male germline, members of the ERVK family were specifically reactivated upon loss of a germline- Figure 6 : CUT&Tag@home segments the human epigenome with four H3 lysine trimethylation marks: Screenshot of a representative 1 Mb region of the human genome showing CUT&Tag@home profiles for histone H3 lysine-4 methylation of constitutive heterochromatin (K9me3), Polycomb-dependent silenced domains (K27me3) transcribed gene bodies (K36me3), promoters (K4me3), promoters and enhancers (K4me2) and accessible DNA (ATAC-seq, GSM269550). Two regions are expanded to illustrate the predominantly mutual exclusivity of the tri-methylation marks, also showing two SuRE autonomous regulatory elements annotated as an enhancer (above) and promoter (below).

Thus the enrichment of ERVK in the heavily H3K9-trimethylated class is consistent with a role for this modification in maintaining genome integrity by suppression of endogenous retroviral proliferation.",

K-means clustering of the 2-kb region centered around the midpoints all Chromosome 1 ERV elements separated the ERVs into a heavily H3K9trimethylated Cluster I (11%), a weakly H3K9-trimethylated Cluster II (27%) and Cluster III with background levels of H3K9 trimethylation (62%).

Since our original CUT&Tag publication in April, 2019, we have distributed >600 pA-Tn5 aliquots to laboratories around the world, and during that time our original protocol has been the most popular of the ~6000 protocols on Protocols.io (Lenny Teytelman, personal communication). Because CUT&Tag requires that cells or nuclei remain intact throughout the procedure, there are no harsh treatments or toxic chemicals required, which makes the protocol inherently safe and appropriate for being performed in a home utility area. Therefore, we expect that CUT&Tag@home will be welcomed by a substantial cohort of users, whether they are able to work in the lab or can only work at home subject to COVID-19 restrictions.",

Elimination of the DNA purification steps of CUT&Tag allows all operations from mixing of nuclei with magnetic beads to final library purification to be performed entirely by successive treatments of bead-bound nuclei in a single PCR tube. This protocol can be performed on as many as 32 samples in a single day with starting cell numbers ranging from <100 to ~100,000. We have extended the versatility of this streamlined CUT&Tag protocol by demonstrating that it can be performed with minor equipment, reagent and supply needs using materials borrowed from the lab or purchased online and delivered. This enables researchers, students and others with little hands-on laboratory experience to perform chromatin profiling at home. Although we do not expect that quantification, quality control and pooling of barcoded samples and sequencing to be also done at home, these services are likely to be available at many commercial and academic facilities, even during the COVID-19 crisis. In the longer term, we expect that the simplicity of our CUT&Tag@home protocol makes it just as suitable for the lab bench as it is for the laundry room.",
