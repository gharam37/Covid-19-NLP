The low testing rate is often cited as a possible explanation for the low observed positive cases. There is considerable interest and need to understand the true rate of infection, but at the same time, it is difficult to obtain unless random tests are carried out at the population level. Since that may involve a long waiting period, what can be the possible predicted rates from available models across countries? In this context, we used the model proposed by Bommer and Vollmer to assess the quality of official case records.",

The details of Bommer and Vollmer (2020) model are presented elsewhere 5 . We have adjusted the age-specific infection fatality rates presented in the Lancet with the age distribution of the population of India and 13 states which have more than 100 confirmed cases as on 8 th April. The Lancet study reported perfect ascertainment between observed and estimated cases in the age group 50-59 years. We apply the infection fatality rate of this age group to all ages assuming infection attack rate is uniform for population across the agegroups in India. The number of infections is estimated as the number of deaths till April, 08, 2020 divided by the adjusted infection fatality rate. Based on the global evidence, we assumed that the mean duration between the onsets of symptoms to deaths is 14 days. Thus, it yields the total number of infections two weeks prior to April 8. The detection rate is estimated as the number of confirmed cases divided by the estimated number of infections. Further, by taking data from reports of the ICMR, we have also adjusted the detection rates with the sum of the difference in the rate of change in testing done on a daily basis to derive a more realistic figure of the total number of infections (confirmed + undetected infections) for India as of April 8.",

As a result, the detection rate of infections for the country as a whole remains merely at 3.6%, below the world average of 6%. Based on the evidence from other countries, we assume that a major share (85%) of these cases may be those with milder symptoms, who may not have ended up in hospitals 6 . However, we found a huge variation within India. Among 13 states which have more than 100 COVID-19 cases, the detection rate varies from 81.9% (of 410 estimated infections) in Kerala to 0.8% (of 35487 estimated infections) in Madhya Pradesh and 2.4% (of 7431 estimated infections) in Gujarat. The detection rate in Maharashtra (the biggest COVID-19 infected state) is also very low with 1.8% (of 61,268 estimated infections). However, Rajasthan is moderately doing well in terms of the detection rate of infections by confirming 15.8% of total estimated infections. Even, economically and health systems wise better-off states such as Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Delhi are performing poorly in terms of detection rate; thus, experiencing more deaths than Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh where more individuals were tested than estimated infections (Figure1 & Table 1 ).",
