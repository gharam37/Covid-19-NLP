In many inflammatory diseases, signaling proteins termed cytokines play a critical role in disease pathology. These proteins are secreted mainly from hematopoietic cells including lymphocytes and macrophages, and along with such cells, play a central role in many diseases as well as in health [4] [5] [6] [7] . In the case of COVID-19, and other viral diseases, they can significantly affect the course and outcome for the patient. This may manifest itself as a cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm, observed in many patients as highly elevated levels of these proteins during acute disease. While first linked to the 1918 influenza pandemic [8] the cytokine storm was extensively documented in the avian H5N1 influenza virus infection [9] . H5N1 influenza virus causes acute lung injury as also observed in COVID-19. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the principal cause of respiratory failure associated with severe influenza as it is with COVID-19 and other members of the Coronavirus family. In severe influenza infections the extent of lung injury is due to dysregulated inflammatory responses. Hence, to compare and contrast immune-related trends in H5N1 influenza and coronavirus infections could enable clinical research to more effectively consider treatment options.",

Within research publications, a copious amount of diseaserelated trends are captured; these can be freely extracted from PubMed records [10] . We have previously developed a framework for extracting disease-immune relationships from PubMed abstracts by relying on the linking of such abstracts to concepts from Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) [11] . MeSH is the National Library of Medicine's controlled vocabulary thesaurus, consisting of terms (naming and descriptors) within a hierarchical structure; they are used for indexing MEDLINE PubMed publications. MeSH descriptors associated with each MEDLINE citation are manually assigned and provide a straightforward, and useful, knowledge resource. Numerous works using concept cooccurrences in biomedical texts or in associated MeSH terms have shown the utility of MeSH in capturing biomedical knowledge [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Our own assessment of the ability of MeSH descriptors associated within the same PubMed record to represent a true (meaningful and feasible) relationship between the terms has shown that co-occurrence of MeSH descriptors linked to any given PubMed record are a good source for mining dependencies between different types of biomedical entities [11] .",

Where asthma and the common cold are directly linked to Interferon-gamma (IFNg), IL-8, IL-2 and IL-5, diarrhea is linked to IL-18. Differences in the types of cells included in each sub-network can also be seen.

When comparing these cytokine and cell occurrences to those in H5N1-related abstracts, some patterns are similar to those observed in the Coronavirus-related abstracts; specifically, similar rates of occurrences were observed for IFNb, TNFa, IL-18, and Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GMCSF), in all cases these were higher than in the SARS-related abstracts.

Sub-networks, each stemming from a selected disease, illustrate some differences between Coronavirus-, SARS-, and H5N1-related comorbidities and complications. For example, in Coronavirus-related abstracts, diarrhea, one of the reported symptoms of COVID-19, is associated with IL-18, monocytes, T-lymphocytes, dendritic cells and erythrocytes. On the other hand, asthma, a risk factor for adverse outcomes in COVID-19, is linked to IL-8, IL-5, IL-2, IFNg, eosinophils, and neutrophils. This analysis has highlighted some potential targets for therapy. For example, IL-5 is a key growth factor for and activator of eosinophils (both picked up by our research). Eosinophils can be recruited to the lungs, where they have a poorly understood role in health and disease [19] . It has also been reported eosinophil count is a potential marker for COVID-19 patient improvement [20, 21] . The role of eosinophils and IL-5 in this disease certainly requires further investigation. Treatments for asthma that modulate eospinophil action are available; Reslizumab and Mepolizumab are anti-IL-5 antibody therapies that may have potential in treatment of viral respiratory disease, if eosinophils are activated [22, 23] . It is speculative to comment on the role of eosinophils in COVID-19 disease; however in overall consideration of a fast developing literature in a pandemic many possible clinical trial options could be considered. As the literature evolves we suggest the methodologies described here can play a progressive part in rational development of strategies for optimal treatment in an informed environment.",

We first assume that co-occurrences of MeSH descriptors within a PubMed record represent a true relationship or dependency; further, some of the associations and co-occurrences were low (i.e. present in only few abstracts). However, our previous investigation into the extent to which MeSH term co-occurrence captures real association has found that at least 70% of co-occurrences of different types of entities (disease, cell type, or cytokine) represent true direct or indirect dependencies, but it is likely to be higher than that [11] . Additionally, patterns of MeSH co-occurrence have shown to capture known medical associations, as well as identify potentially novel ones, thus providing further confidence in the approach. A second limitation is a lack of directionality and type for the associations captured by approach; nevertheless, we show that these mere co-occurrences may still hold valuable information. Finally, since at the time of writing, very few publications directly related to COVID-19 are available, our data mining has had to focus on Coronavirus-and other related lung-damaging diseases as a proxy for COVID-19. Nevertheless, we have created a paradigm for such research which is easy to use and apply, and demonstrated its utility. ",
