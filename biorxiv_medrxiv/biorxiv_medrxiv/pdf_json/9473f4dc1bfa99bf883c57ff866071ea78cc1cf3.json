            "text": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Age, smoking, obesity, and chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes have been described as risk factors for severe complications and mortality in COVID-19. Obesity and diabetes are usually associated with dysregulated lipid synthesis and clearance which can initiate or aggravate pulmonary inflammation and injury. It has been shown that for viral entry into the host cell, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors present on the cells. We aimed to characterize how SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates lipid metabolism pathways in the host and the effect of dysregulated lipogenesis on the regulation of ACE2, specifically in obesity. In our study, through the re-analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data, we first found that lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed upregulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism, including the SOC3 gene which is involved in regulation of inflammation and inhibition of leptin signaling. This is of interest as viruses may hijack host lipid metabolism to allow completion of their viral replication cycles. Furthermore, a mouse model of diet-induced obesity showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lungs which negatively correlated with the expression of genes that code for sterol response element binding proteins 1 and 2 (SREBP). Suppression of Srebp1 showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lung. Together our results suggest that the dysregulated lipogenesis and the subsequently high ACE2 expression in obese patients might be the mechanism underlying the increased risk for severe complications in those patients when infected by SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "As the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating, people worldwide are warned to take necessary precautions to avoid infection. With changing statistics every day, it is clear that certain groups of individuals are at increased risk of severe infection. In particular, the groups at risk are the elderly, individuals with chronic health conditions such as diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Most cases of COVID-19 are classified as mild or moderate. However, 14% of the cases are severe and may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and even death in those infected (1) . Therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanism by which this virus causes organ injury and, in particular the immune system which is mounted in response to the infection. A few studies have now identified other risk factors for severe complications and death due to COVID-19, namely smoking and obesity (2, 3) . The findings related to obesity are plausible since obese individuals tend to be more difficult to intubate, and excess body weight may contribute to increased pressure on the diaphragm which may make breathing more difficult during infection. Moreover, it is well established that obesity leads to chronic metainflammation even in the absence of infection which has detrimental effects on the immune system (4) . In addition, obesity is associated with dysregulated lipid synthesis and clearance which can initiate or aggravate pulmonary inflammation. It has also been shown that antiviral medication and vaccines are less effective in obese individuals (5) . In relation to the influenza virus, obesity may have a role in the viral life cycle which along with a dysregulated immune system could lead to severe complications (6) . During the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, obesity was classified as an independent risk factor for hospitalization, need for mechanical ventilation and death. These observations are concerning since over one third of the world population are classified as overweight or obese (7) . Therefore, as this current COVID-19 pandemic is increasing, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms through which obesity increases the complications related to COVID-19 to hopefully be able to design more appropriate therapies. Moreover, understanding the effects of obesity on COVID-19 may shed light on the pathogenecity of SARS-CoV-2.",

The Raw Read Counts were retrieved and filtered from non-expressing genes that showed zero counts in the six samples. Out of the original 23710 genes, only 15487 were expressing and selected for further analysis. The filtered gene expression was uploaded to AltAnalyze software for Comprehensive Transcriptome Analysis (12) . Principle component analysis and Heatmap clustering were generated, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using LIMMA algorithm built in AltAnalyze software . The genes that made the optimal hierarchal cosine clustering were identified, and the common pathways shared by these genes are listed according to their significance.

            "text": "The present study focused on the relationship between ACE2 expression and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. Therefore, we were interested to see how dysregulation of lipid metabolism could affect ACE2 expression. SREBPs are a family of transcription factors which control lipid synthesis and adipogenesis by controlling enzymes required for cholesterol, fatty acid, triacylglycerol and phospholipid synthesis. In cholesterol deprivation, they translocate from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus where they are then targeted to the nucleus following cleavage. In the nucleus, they proceed to induce the expression of fatty acid and sterol synthesis (40) . SREBP family is composed of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2. SREBP-1 exists as two isoforms: SREBP1-a and SREBP1-c. These isoforms are controlled by independent regulatory proteins and appear to respond differently to different states of lipid factors. Our study suggests that suppressing SREBP1 leads to upregulation of ACE2 expression.",

This is of importance as dysregulation of lipid metabolism is a feature of obesity, one of the risk factors of COVID-19. More importantly our data reveal that this increased susceptibility may be due to an increase in ACE2 expression in the lung which is regulated by SREBP1. These findings may potentially aide us in understanding the increased susceptibility in relation to other risk factors such as diabetes and hypercholesteremia.",
