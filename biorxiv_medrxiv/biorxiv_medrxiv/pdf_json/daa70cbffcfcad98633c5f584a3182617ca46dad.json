            "text": "The CRISPR/Cas12a RNA-guided complexes have a tremendous potential for nucleic acid detection due to its ability to indiscriminately cleave ssDNA once bound to a target DNA. However, the current CRISPR/Cas12a systems are limited to detecting DNA in a picomolar detection limit without an amplification step. Here, we developed a platform with engineered crRNAs and optimized conditions that enabled us to detect DNA, DNA/RNA heteroduplex and methylated DNA with higher sensitivity, achieving a limit of detection of in femtomolar range without any target pre-amplification step. By extending the 3'-or 5'-ends of the crRNA with different lengths of ssDNA, ssRNA, and phosphorothioate ssDNA, we discovered a new selfcatalytic behavior and an augmented rate of LbCas12a-mediated collateral cleavage activity as high as 3.5-fold compared to the wild-type crRNA. We applied this sensitive system to detect as low as 25 fM dsDNA from the PCA3 gene, an overexpressed biomarker in prostate cancer patients, in simulated urine over 6 hours. The same platform was used to detect as low as ~700 fM cDNA from HIV, 290 fM RNA from HCV, and 370 fM cDNA from SARS-CoV-2, all within 30 minutes without a need for target amplification. With isothermal amplification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-LAMP, the modified crRNAs were incorporated in a paper-based lateral flow assay that could detect the target with up to 23-fold higher sensitivity within 40-60 minutes.",

We speculate that chemical modifications of the crRNA can potentially change its nature of binding and subsequently alter this collateral cleavage due to conformational changes of the Cas12a dynamic endonuclease domain.",

            "text": "We placed ssDNA, ssRNA, and phosphorothioate ssDNA extensions of various lengths ranging from 7 to 31 nucleotides on either the 3'-or 5'-ends of the crRNA targeting GFP (green fluorescent protein), referred to here as crGFP (Fig. 1b-h) . In order to measure the collateral or trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a, we employed a FRET-based reporter used in DETECTR, 1 composed of a fluorophore (FAM) and a quencher (3IABkFQ) connected by a 5-nucleotide sequence (TTATT), which displays increased fluorescence upon cleavage. Consistent with the previous literature 13 , respectively. The fold in fluorescence was normalized by taking the ratio of background-corrected fluorescence signals of sample with activator to the corresponding sample without activator. Error bars represent \u00b1 SEM, where n = 6 replicates; two-way ANOVA test two-way ANOVA (n=3, N=2, ns P > 0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001). The experiments were repeated at least twice with n = 3 per experiment. when using wild-type crRNAs, we observed that the LbCas12a exhibited higher trans-cleavage activity than the AsCas12a or the FnCas12a, and therefore, we designed various modified crRNAs compatible with LbCas12a. Using the same reporters, we discovered that ssDNA and ssRNA extensions on the 3'-end of crGFP markedly enhanced the trans-cleavage ability of target-activated LbCas12a. Comparing the two types, the ssDNA extensions demonstrated higher activity than the corresponding ssRNA (Figs. 1b-d,f and Supplementary Figs. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . On the other hand, the phosphorothioate ssDNA extensions at the 3'-or 5'-end displayed minimal or no activity, showing decreased fluorescence intensity as modification length increased (Figs. 1e,h and Supplementary Figs. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . This observation suggests that further extending the crRNA with 13-mer phosphorothioate ssDNA and beyond significantly inhibits LbCas12a trans-cleavage activity. The finding corroborated B. Li and colleagues that phosphorothioate ssDNA may prevent crRNA-Cas12a-DNA complex formation. 14 Notably, the 3'-DNA with 7-mer extensions on the crGFP, referred as crGFP+3'DNA7, yielded the highest fluorescence signal compared to other modifications, measuring approximately 3.5fold higher intensity than the wild-type crGFP (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Figs. 1a,2a) . By investigating the conformational changes from the crystal structure of the binary LbCas12a:crRNA complex 12, 15, 16 , we observed that the 3'-end modifications on crRNA is proximal to the RuvC region of the LbCas12a. This supports our observation that the 3'-end extensions lead to higher trans-cleavage activity than the 5'-end. We speculated that once an R-loop is formed between crRNA and dsDNA or ssDNA activator, the LbCas12a executes a partial trans-cleavage of the 3'end of crRNA, leaving an overhang. These remaining extensions may further expand the nuclease domain in the LbCas12a, resulting in conformational changes and allowing more access for nonspecific ssDNA cleavage. To confirm our hypothesis, we attached different fluorophores, or fluorophore-quencher pairs separated by DNA linkers, to either the 3'-or 5'-end of the crGFP with 7-mer DNA extensions and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Surprisingly, we discovered that the 3'-end of the crRNA is processed by LbCas12a only in the presence of an activator while the 5'-end is cleaved by LbCas12a even in the absence of the activator (Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Figs. 6,7).",

As a result, the 5'-end modifications are eliminated and converted back to the wild-type crRNA before complexing with the activator. This finding reinforces our previous observation that the 5'extended crRNA has similar collateral cleavage activity as the wild-type crRNA. Fascinated by LbCas12a pre-crRNA processing as previously described 17 and from our observations, we investigated how extensions of the mature crRNA would influence the trans-cleavage activity compared to the corresponding extended pre-crRNA. We discovered that the modified pre-crRNA and modified mature crRNA (tru-crRNA) exhibited comparable trans-cleavage efficiency (Fig.  2g) . Furthermore, when a dsDNA or an ssDNA activator was present, the 3'-and 5'-end DNA- To further understand the LbCas12a enhanced enzymatic activity, we performed a Michaelis-Menten kinetic study on the wild-type crGFP and the crGFP+3'DNA7 and observed that the ratio Kcat/Km was 3.2-fold higher for crGFP+3'DNA7 than the unmodified crGFP (Figs. 2c,d) .

Furthermore, these results led us to question whether the trans-cleavage activity is dependent on the sequence of ssDNA extensions on 3'-end of the crRNA.

This led us to test a range of divalent metal cations and discovered that most ions including Ca 2+ , Co 2+ , Zn 2+ , Cu 2+ , and Mn 2+ significantly inhibited the LbCas12a activity ( Supplementary Fig. 14) . By further investigating the Zn 2+ mediated inhibition of LbCas12a, we found that the inhibition was dose-dependent ( Supplementary Fig. 15 ). Interestingly, Ni 2+ ions showed an unusual cis-cleavage activity possibly due to its interactions with the His tags on LbCas12a ( Supplementary Fig. 14) . Among the tested divalent metal ions, the Mg 2+ ions showed the highest in vitro cis-cleavage activity, which was consistent with the literature. 20 Therefore, we characterized the effect of Mg 2+ ions on trans-cleavage activity of LbCas12a. With increasing the concentration of Mg 2+ ions, a significant increase in fluorescence signal was observed in an in vitro trans-cleavage assay. By varying the amount of Mg 2+ in the Cas12a reaction, we identified that the optimal condition of Mg 2+ was around 13 mM ( Fig. 3a-b and Supplementary Figs. [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

In contrast, the wild-type crRNA also showed a similar 29 fM limit of detection at 13 mM Mg 2+ concentration while the limit of detection was ~10 pM at 3 mM Mg 2+ concentrations after 6 hours.

While as low as 25 fM (equivalent to 2.5 attomoles) of PCA3 cDNA can be detected with ENHANCE without any target amplification ( Supplementary Fig. 19) , the clinical concentration of PCA3 mRNA in the urine can be lower and therefore may require target pre-amplification. 25, 26 Therefore, we incorporated and tested a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) step to isothermally amplify the PCA3 cDNA.

DNA methylation is also one of the bacterial defense systems that fight against outside invaders. It would be fascinating to understand how LbCas12a collateral cleavage is able to recognize methylated DNA targets. This curiosity let us to discover that the wild-type crRNA had significantly reduced activity in detecting methylated DNA, containing 5-methyl cytosine, compared to the unmethylated DNA. However, the ENHANCE showed 5.4-fold and 3.4-fold and higher trans-cleavage activity compared to the wild-type crRNA for targeting the methylated dsDNA and ssDNA, respectively (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 20a) .",

            "text": "Although there are no reports on RNA-guided RNA targeting by LbCas12a, we envisioned that an RNA can potentially be detected as a DNA/RNA heteroduplex. To test this hypothesis, we incorporated a reverse transcription step to convert RNA into cDNA/RNA heteroduplex before detecting the RNA with a trans-cleavage assay. We discovered that the RNA can only be detected if the target strand for crRNA is a DNA but not an RNA in a heteroduplex. Notably, the efficiency of the trans-cleavage activity for the DNA/RNA heteroduplex was found to be significantly lower than the corresponding ssDNA or dsDNA (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 20b) . However, the DNA/RNA heteroduplex achieved an improved enzymatic collateral activity when using the crRNA+3'DNA7 compared to the wild-type crRNA. We applied the ENHANCE to successfully detect low picomolar concentrations of HIV RNA target encoding Tat gene with our DNA/RNA heteroduplex detection strategy (Fig. 3f) . In parallel, ssDNA and dsDNA targets from HIV were also detected with much higher sensitivity compared to the wild-type crRNA within 15 to 30 minutes (Figs. 3f,g and Supplementary Figs. 21) . We further applied the ENHANCE for detecting HCV ssDNA and HCV dsDNA gene encoding a polyprotein precursor, both of which indicated consistent enhanced collateral activity than the wild-type crRNAs within 24 minutes (Figs. 3f, 3h , and Supplementary Fig. 22 ). The limit of detection for HIV and HCV targets were calculated to be 700 fM cDNA and 290 fM ssDNA, respectively.",
