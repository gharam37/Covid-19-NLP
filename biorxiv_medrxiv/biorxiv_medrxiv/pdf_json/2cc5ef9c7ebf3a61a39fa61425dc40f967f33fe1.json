The Islamic Republic of Iran was the first Middle East country to report a case of death due to coronavirus (19 February 2020) and is currently among countries with the highest prevalence of COVID-19. By 3 April 2020, there were 53,183 confirmed cases in Iran, 3,294 of which had already deceased [3] . Given the rapid spread of the virus, the government immediately responded by establishing more than 40 laboratories to enhance the testing capacity, and consequently, there was a sudden spike in the reported number of positive cases. The first cases were immediately reported to the Health Department, and preventive protocols were developed and put in place to limit the further spread of the infection. These included cancelling in-person classes in schools and universities as of 25 February 2020, and switching to online platforms, as well as public awareness campaigns that encourage citizens to minimize face-to-face contact and promote social distancing. Nonetheless, the timeframe from 20 March to 2 April 2020 coincides with the 'Norouz Spring Holidays' in Iran. During this time, there is significantly higher rates of social activities, visiting family and friends, trips, shopping, and festivals. This is while the epidemic has already spread throughout the country and beyond. Therefore, close monitoring and evaluation is necessary to investigate the efficiency of control measures, determine the potential community transmission patterns, and predict the progression of the epidemic and the trajectory of the epidemic curve.",

In the present study, the estimated R 0 of 2.7 (95% CI, 2.1 to 3.4) during the early stage of the epidemic is in line with previous estimates [10, [14] [15] [16] . However, higher estimates of R 0 have been reported in larger populations [17, 18] . For precise estimation of R 0 , certain conditions must be met which include the precise detection of cases in the early stages of the epidemic, restricting the calculation to a small timeframe [12] , and choosing the appropriate estimation method [13, 19] . For precise detection of cases, all suspected cases (according to the screening protocol) and cases who have had close contact with confirmed cases should undergo viral nucleic acid testing. In Shahroud, there were 1055 suspected cases, and 405 of them tested positive. However, in the early stages of the epidemic in Iran, there was limited capacity for testing, and the calculated R 0 may be an underestimation.",

In addition, two other basic measures were taken in Shahroud: 1) At the time of hospital discharge, all patients and their caregivers were provided with counseling and training on how to be isolated at home for 14 days, and families received information about how to care for patients; 2) Active contact tracing with follow-up of patients' family members and friends, work colleagues, and other possible contacts and referral of suspected cases to medical centers [9].",

This reduction highlights the success of preventive measures in place, but we must be prepared for the doubling of cases over the next month.
