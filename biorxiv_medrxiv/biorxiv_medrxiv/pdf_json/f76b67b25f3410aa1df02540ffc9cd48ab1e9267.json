The levels of spread and severity of the virus lead to a wide-spread political and economic turmoil. We believe that two critical contributing factors need to be taken into account by the authorities to make effective decisions for controlling the spread of the virus: (i ) being familiar with the most effective controlling measures and (ii ) having a mathematical model to predict the spread of the virus. In this study, we provided information regarding both of these crucial factors. First, we investigated the importance of different measures such as quarantine, isolation, face mask, social distancing, etc. in controlling the virus in various countries. We then present a mathematical model to predict the spread of the virus in different countries.",

Some provinces in China have enforced compulsory face mask policies in public; however, China's national guideline has adopted a risk-based approach in offering recommendations for using face masks. There is a consistency in the rec-155 ommendation that symptomatic people and those in health-care settings should use face masks, but discrepancies are observed in the community settings. We believe one of the main reasons that some of the countries would not recommend the entire population of the country to use face masks is the shortage in the number of available masks.

The potential of the health care systems in different coun-40 tries such as the number of available ICU beds, ventilators, test kits, masks, etc can be deemed as crucial factors in controlling the spread and mortality rates of the COVID-19 globally. On the other hand, trips and traditional events in various countries are the main contributing factors in increasing the spread rate of COVID-19. Thus, it is not deniable that controlling the epidemic re-2. Mathematical model In this study, we use one of the most classic epidemic models, namely the SIR model. Three states are defined in this model: \u2022 S(t): the number of individuals susceptible of contracting the infection at time t; 65 \u2022 I(t): the number of active infected individuals at time t; \u2022 R(t): the number of individuals who are recovered at time t.",

Of course, the number of confirmed cases is a function of the number of tests which have been done by each country, the countries' population, etc. Obviously, there is significant uncertainty and underestimation in the actual number of individuals who currently have the disease. Keep in mind that there 100 are also many individuals who do not show severe symptoms when they get the disease. Thus, the number of infected people is not an appropriate measure to determine how much the virus spreads in each country.",

Quarantine has been always one of the measures for the outbreaks such as the 14th-century Italian \"quarantino\" to control the plague(Black Death), SARS outbreak, and etc. In the case of COVID-19, as it is 125 reported in [14], the median incubation period is 7-day for adults based on the data obtained from 2015 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases including 99 children in 28 Chinese provinces. They suggested that the extension of the adult quarantine period to 18 days or 21 days could be more effective in preventing virus-spreading and controlling the disease. Even though effective in controlling 130 the spread rate of the virus, quarantine may result in adverse psychological issues. For instance, it is reported that some people quarantined during the SARS outbreak experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression [15, 16]. Moreover, people may experience financial hardship. Thus, it is critical for the authorities to make sure quarantined people have ongoing the spread of the virus. South Korea did a pretty well job in this matter. One of the measures which have been a matter of controversy among different countries and organizations is the essence of using face masks. The countries have various recommendations on face mask use in community settings. Since 150 the outbreak of SARS, the use of face masks has become ubiquitous in China, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and some other Asian countries.",

In this study, we pro-210 vided information regarding both of these contributing factors.
