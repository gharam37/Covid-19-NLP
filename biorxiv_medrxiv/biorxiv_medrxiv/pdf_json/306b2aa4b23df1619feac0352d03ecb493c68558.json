It was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 11 March 2020, at which time almost 1000 deaths were reported in Europe with confirmed community transmission in multiple European countries. 1 In addition to marshalling therapeutic options, countries have adopted a range of non-pharmaceutical public health measures to reduce transmission. These have been broadly characterized as suppressive approaches, which aim to stop transmission through a mix of targeted and untargeted social measures, and mitigation approaches, which aim to slow the spread and shield vulnerable populations without ultimately interrupting transmission. 2 3 Countries such as China and Singapore give examples of rapidly introduced suppressive strategies, while Sweden is the most prominent example of mitigation-limiting the extent of social distancing and economically disruptive interventions while still aiming to slow the spread sufficiently to allow for an effective medical response. 3 4 Studying the Swedish strategy and its health implications thus yields important lessons for global public health policy.",

Based on the experiences from China, Italy and Spain, the critically limiting resource in reducing COVID-19 related mortality is the capacity of intensive care with mechanical ventilation -since many COVID-19 pneumonia patients die from severe respiratory diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 11 12 Overall mortality for the outbreak in China was estimated to be 1.4% of the confirmed cases (0.7% including unconfirmed cases), 9 yet figures up to 5.7% were reported for the Hubei province, which has been hit hardest. 13 .

While the pandemic is still ongoing and exact statistics are not available, numerical modelling provides timely guidance for healthcare needs given multiple scenarios, as it permits predictions based on available epidemiological and demographic data. 14 Predictive models for COVID-19 have been used to assess the impact of the pandemic and guide national policy. 2 3 15-19 While aggregate population models yield the basic principles of epidemic spread, discrete models that take into account geographic and demographic structure permit more specific assessment of different interventions in national contexts. Individual-based discrete models -also called agent-based models, since every individual of a geographic region is modelled by an agentprovide a flexible platform to analyse the propagation of emerging infectious diseases and the effect of social distancing and similar behavioural changes. 20 In these individual-based models, the behaviour and health state of each individual in a country is modelled, enabling explicit representation of social-contact patterns between individuals in the household, school, workplace and community. These models similarly permit explicit representation of age-and location-specific social distancing such as school closure, increased telework, or geographic quarantine measures.",

Healthcare workers can become infected via three mechanisms: \"community\" exposure in their households or outside the hospital, transmission among healthcare staff during breaks and other times when personal protective equipment (PPE) is not worn, or occupational exposure to infected patients (either identified as such or not). Given sufficient PPE, occupational exposure should be minimal, and this has been shown in other well-resourced settings. However, at high patient load, PPE has been limiting in a large number of countries, and the Swedish PPE recommendations have recently been reduced, 37 38 potentially in response to PPE shortages. We approximate a 75% reduction in transmissibility within the hospital in order to capture the aggregate effect of PPE usage and non-PPE encounters. There are substantial uncertainties in this estimate-healthcare workers without PPE are at increased risk of infection, so in the absence of universal PPE protocols, unidentified COVID-19 patients pose a higher probability of transmission in the healthcare context than outside.

Under this gross approximation, we predict substantial numbers of healthcare workers to become infected under the current public-health policies. In particular, 90% of healthcare workers could become infected with 1.5% of total healthcare workers in need of hospitalisation at the peak and 15.8% unable to work due to severe infection, which could affect the healthcare capacity. Note that these estimates are based on the availability of rigorous PPE for healthcare workers; obviously without proper PPE these numbers will be higher. Under mandated social distancing measures, fewer healthcare workers would be infected and thus excluded from the workforce. This is plotted in Figure 5 .",

This predicts a relatively narrow window for public-health interventions and a relatively high flux of patients through the healthcare system. Time-curves for predicted numbers of infected patients, hospitalized patients, ICUpatients and deaths are plotted in Figures 1-4. Taking Sweden as a whole, without further intervention, and presuming \"standard\" ICU admission criteria without restriction to ICU care (new ICU admission guidelines for COVID-19 have been communicated March 17, 2020 for Stockholm region 36 ), the model predicts a required ICU capacity of at least 20,000 beds if continuing with current recommendations, with a peak in the first half of May.",
