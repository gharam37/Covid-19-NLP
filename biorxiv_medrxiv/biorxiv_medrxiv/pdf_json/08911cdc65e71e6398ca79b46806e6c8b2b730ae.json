X chromosome inactivation, whereby gene expression from one gene copy of the X chromosome is silenced by DNA methylation, is essential to maintain normal levels of gene expression and comparable expression levels between male and female cells. In women with lupus, reduced DNA methylation has been shown to result in defective X chromosome inactivation 7 . Hypomethylation of the normally inactivate X chromosome leads to an abnormal increase in the expression levels of affected genes. This abnormal X chromosome inactivation has been demonstrated to mediate increased expression of CD40LG in CD4+ T cells in women with lupus, contributing to T cell autoreactivity in this disease 7 . CD40LG expression in CD4 + T cells isolated from healthy women was similarly increased after treatment with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine. This gene-dose effect of the X chromosome has been proposed to explain, at least in part, sex bias in lupus. Of interest, men with two X chromosomes, Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY), have a significantly higher risk to develop lupus compared to normal men (46, XY) and a similar risk to women 8 .",

This hypomethylation involves several CpG sites located in the ACE2 promoter region proximal to the transcription start site, the 5'-untranslated region, and the 3'-untranslated region, suggesting functional regulatory effect of the methylation changes. Furthermore, we can induce hypomethylation in some of these same CpG sites in CD4 + T cells isolated from normal healthy women treated with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine 11 . Importantly, in a subset of female lupus patients characterized by skin, joint, and kidney involvement ACE2 promoter region was significantly hypomethylated in CD4 + T cells compared to age and sex matched normal healthy controls 12 . Gene expression profiles extracted from a publicly available dataset (GEO accession: GSE4588) showed a significant overexpression of ACE2 mRNA in lupus CD4 + T cells compared to normal healthy controls ( Figure 1B) . We further confirm hypomethylation in ACE2 in an independent set of female lupus patients characterized by kidney involvement ( Figure 1C) . Gene expression profiles in the same set of patients showed ~1.5-2-fold ACE2 overexpression compared to healthy controls, although his did not reach statistical significance ( Figure 1D ).",

The likelihood of disseminated SARS-CoV-2 infection in lupus patients might be increased due to ACE2 overexpression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This is independent of any potential effects of immunosuppressive medications. Based on this model, we also expect that lupus flares will increase the likelihood of infection with SARS-CoV-2 due to increased oxidative stress and DNA demethylation of ACE2. Therefore, maintaining remission in lupus patients is of critical importance during this pandemic. Drugs that target epigenetic mechanisms should be considered for further investigation in COVID-19.",

This might contribute to a cytokine storm and tissue damage during COVID-19 infections in lupus patients. Indeed, we have also demonstrated progressive demethylation in CD4 + T cells of the gene that encodes the master cytokine regulator NF\u03baB and a number of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes and their key transcription factors with increasing disease activity in lupus 21 .",

            "text": "Schematic presentation suggesting mechanisms that might increase susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 in lupus patients. Lupus is characterized by a DNA methylation defect which has been demonstrated in multiple cell types. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes ACE2 as a receptor for entry into cells. ACE2 is a methylation-sensitive gene located on the X chromosome. Lupus patients show evidence of ACE2 hypomethylation possibly mediating ACE2 overexpression which will increase the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral infections are associated with increased oxidative stress, which is known to induce lupus flares and induce further DNA demethylation. Hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2 in T cells (and possibly other cell types) will facilitate T cell viral infections and viral dissemination resulting in a more severe COVID-19. Interferon-regulated genes and other inflammatory cytokine genes are hypomethylated in lupus patients and thereby epigenetically poised or primed for transcription upon interferon exposure resulting from viral immune response. This epigenetic priming might increase the possibility of cytokine storm in lupus patients. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
