If the proportion of asymptomatic infections is larger than 30 30%, contact tracing and isolation cannot achieve containment for an R0 of 2.5. Achieving 31 containment by social distancing requires a reduction of numbers of non-household 32 contacts by around 90%. Depending on the realized level of contact reduction, tracing and 33 isolation of only household contacts, or of household and non-household contacts are 34 necessary to reduce the effective reproduction number to below 1. A combination of social 35 Research in context 46 Evidence before this study 47 As of 8 April 2020, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has spread to more than 170 48 countries and has caused near 90,000 deaths of COVID-19 worldwide. In the absence of 49 effective medicines and vaccines, the preventive measures are limited to social distancing, 50 isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and identification and quarantining of their 51 contacts. Evidence suggests that a substantial portion of transmission may occur before the 52 onset of symptoms and before cases can be isolated, and that many cases remain 53 unascertained. This has potentially important implications for the prospect of containment 54 by combinations of these measures. 55 Added value of this study 56 Using a stochastic transmission model armed with current best estimates of epidemiological 57 parameters, we evaluated under which conditions containment could be achieved with 58 combinations of social distancing, isolation and contact tracing. We investigated the level of 59 social distancing needed for containment, and how an additional implementation of 60 isolation and contact tracing may likely help to in reducing the effective reproduction 61 number to below 1, the critical threshold. We analyzed what proportion of household and 62 non-household contacts need to be isolated effectively to achieve containment depending 63 on the level of social distancing in the population. We estimated the impact of combinations 64 of these measures on epidemic growth rate and doubling time for the number of infections. 5 household contacts is sufficient, depends on levels of social distancing and timeliness of 68 tracing and isolation. 69 Implications of all the available evidence 70 Our analyses based on best understanding of the epidemiology of COVID-19, highlight that 71 if social distancing is not complete, isolation and contact tracing at least of household 72 contacts can help to delay and lower the epidemic peak. High levels of timely contact 73 tracing of household and non-household contacts may be sufficient to control the epidemic. 74 Introduction 75 As of early April 2020, the number of infections of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is still 76 increasing at an exponential rate in many countries, while the virus is expanding its range to 77 all parts of the world. There are no registered effective medicines, treatment options are 78 mainly supportive, and there are no vaccines available, limiting preventive measures mainly 79 to social distancing combined with isolation of infected persons and those that have high 80 likelihood of being infected, for instance because they have been traced as contacts of 81 infected persons [1, 2] . However, recently it was questioned by high-ranked officials of the 82 World Health Organization (WHO) whether social distancing or lockdowns are sufficient to 83 stop the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-84 who-ryan/lockdowns-not-enough-to-defeat-coronavirus-whos-ryan-idUSKBN2190FM). 85 Possibly, additional measures are needed, for example active tracing of contacts in 86 combination with isolation of infected contacts. Also, such measures will be important in the To what extent local containment or local slowing down of an epidemic by isolation and 92 contact tracing is successful depends on the fraction of infections that remain asymptomatic 93 or have mild disease, and on the infectiousness before the onset of symptoms [4, 5] . It is 94 known that a high probability of asymptomatic infection, a high proportion of transmission 95 occurring before the onset of symptoms, a long delay between case finding and isolation, 96 and high overall transmissibility all factor in negatively in the likelihood that an outbreak can 97 7 be contained [6] [7] [8] [9] . For SARS-CoV-2, evidence indicates that a high fraction of infected 98 persons is infectious before they show symptoms (up to 50%), that a substantial fraction of 99 infections may be asymptomatic or show only mild symptoms (up to 80%), and that the We focus on conditions that make containment of an early epidemic possible, but also on 114 the impact of isolation and contact tracing when containment is not possible, or in an exit 115 phase from social distancing. In a population with social distancing in place, we investigate 116 what the additional impact of isolation and contact tracing can be for reaching containment 117 or slowing down the spread. We report effective reproduction number, the (exponential) 118 rate of increase, and the doubling time of the epidemic for scenarios with various 119 combinations of interventions.

As it is likely that, on the 122 one hand, isolation and contact tracing will be more effective in close contact settings with 123 well-defined contacts (household, workplace) than in the community (commuting, public Table 1) . We distinguish 139 between household contacts and non-household contacts, which differ in the risk of 140 infection and the delay and effectiveness of tracing and isolation. Intervention effectiveness 141 is determined by the daily probability of being diagnosed during the infectious period (Table   142 2). Furthermore, intervention effectiveness depends on the delays in tracing household and 143 non-household contacts, respectively, and the proportions of contacts can be found and 144 isolated. We assume that isolation is perfect, i.e. that isolated persons cannot transmit any Natural history 150 We assume that the latent period lasts between 1 and 3 days. Individuals then become 151 infectious for at most 10 days. Infectivity is high at the beginning of the infectious period 152 and decays to low levels during these 10 days ( Figure S1a ). The probability of symptoms 153 onset increases during the first 4 days of the infectious period, thereby influencing the daily 154 probability of diagnosis during the infectious period (see below).",

We model the daily number of household contacts with a Poisson distribution, 157 and the numbers of non-household contacts with a negative binomial distribution (Table 1) , 158 with parameters based on the average household size in the Netherlands, and numbers of 159 contacts observed in a contact study in the Netherlands (FigureS1b) [20] . With the chosen 160 parameters, the mean number of contacts per day is 13.2 (SD 8.5). 161 On each day of the infectious period, an individual makes a number of contacts according to 162 the contact distribution. This number is reduced by a factor describing the probability that 163 the contact person has already been infected during earlier contacts with the index person. 164 More precisely, the number of contacts is reduced by a factor fk per day k of the infectious 165 period, describing the probability that a contact has already been infected on previous days 166 of the infectious period of the index case. The probability of transmission upon contact with 167 a susceptible household contact is given by the distribution in Figure S1a .

R0 is defined as the number of secondary cases an 231 index case generates on average in a susceptible population, and Re is the number of 232 secondary infections per case when an intervention is in place. R0 is determined by daily 233 transmission probabilities and numbers of contacts. The effective reproduction number is in 234 addition determined by the level of social distancing, diagnosis probabilities, tracing delays, 235 and tracing coverages per day of the infectious period. We can therefore investigate how Re 236 depends on R0 and on the intervention parameters. 237 We are interested in the critical tracing coverage, i.e. what proportion of non-household 238 contacts needs to be found and isolated to control the outbreak, for populations with 239 various levels of social distancing. Furthermore, we study the epidemic growth rate (or 240 epidemic doubling time) without and with contact tracing and isolation and various levels of 241 social distancing. In sensitivity analyses, we study how these quantities depend on the delay 242 to diagnosis of cases and on the delay in contact tracing. For example, we assume that 243 household contacts can be traced with a high coverage and without delay, but that tracing 244 of non-household contact may take longer and be less complete. 245 Based on the distribution of the latent and infectious periods and infectivity, we calculate 246 the exponential growth rate and doubling time under various assumptions on the 247 intervention parameters.

In our255    analysis for different levels of social distancing we assumed that 60% of infected of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data260    interpretation, writing of the manuscript, or the decision to submit for publication. All 261 authors had full access to all the data in the study and were responsible for the decision baseline scenario without interventions we calibrate the transmission probability such 268 that the basic reproduction number equals R0 = 2.5. In that case, 39% of transmissions prevented, the outbreak would be just under the control limit. In the baseline 272 scenario without interventions the exponential growth rate is 0.19 per day and the doubling273 time is 3.6 days, which agrees with published estimates [13]. For sensitivity analysis of the 274 relation between R0 and Re for various combinations of parameters, diagnosed cases alone reduces the doubling time to almost 4 days. If social 278 distancing is implemented 28 days after the first case was diagnosed, and the number of 279 non-household contacts is reduced by 70% [21], the doubling time will increase to around 14 280 days (Figure 1a). The figure also shows that it takes a week before the impact on the 281 epidemic growth starts to be visible. If higher levels of social distancing can be achieved, the 282 doubling times can be increased more (Figure 1b), but even for 90% reduction of contacts 283 the curve has not been flattened. In Figure 1c the impact of the timing of social distancing 284 measures on the further course of the outbreak is shown. The figure demonstrates how 285 every week delay in implementing these measures leads to an order of magnitude higher 286 numbers of cases, thus emphasizing the importance of fast implementation of social 287 distancing measures. Finally, in Figure 4d we show a scenario where social distancing is 288 implemented at day 28 after diagnosing the first case and reduces non-household contacts 289 by 70%. Then at day 49, also contact tracing is implemented.

With increasing proportion of asymptomatic cases, the possibility of 307 controlling the outbreak with contact tracing and isolation quickly fades. This is shown in where we plotted the critical tracing coverage for non-household contacts for 309 several values of R0 as a function of the fraction of symptomatic cases (i.e. the fraction of 310 those who will eventually develop symptoms during their entire infectious period).311 Household contacts are assumed to be always traced and isolated.

Therefore social distancing will not be complete and may not be323 sufficient for containment.

In figure 3a we show for various 325 levels of social distancing, expressed as proportion reduction of non-household contacts, 326 what fraction of household-or additionally non-household contacts need to be traced and 327 isolated to reduce the effective reproduction number.

As evidence is mounting that the347 proportion of asymptomatic and mild cases is large and leads to substantial numbers of 348 unascertained cases [22], most countries have now switched to strategies of social 349 distancing or complete lockdowns. Such measures have proven effective earlier during the 350 2009 influenza pandemic [23, 24]. However, social distancing can never be complete, as 351 healthcare workers and doctors have to continue their work, but also personnel of 352 supermarkets, public transport employees, and others need to have contact outside their 353 households. Therefore, transmission chains may remain. We find that in a situation where 354 60% of cases are ascertained, social distancing of non-household contacts fails to contain 355 the epidemic even if contacts outside the household are reduced by 80%. In that case, 356 combining the social distancing with tracing and isolation of household contacts may suffice 357",

Using these estimates, our 368 model predicts that additional tracing and isolation of infected household contacts would 369 suffice as an additional measure to achieve containment. Possibly, this could be achieved by 370 using digital tracing applications as implemented in South Korea, where it has apparently 371 helped to bring the epidemic under control [the pandemic situation shows that COVID-19 epidemics cannot be contained by 374 contact tracing and rapid isolation alone, this does not render contact tracing useless. On 375 the contrary, contact tracing and isolation when used in addition to social distancing, may be 376 the tool needed to make this mix of strategies successful. Our analyses show that isolation 377 and contact tracing when combined with social distancing can contribute to reducing the 378 growth rate and increasing the doubling time of epidemics, thereby buying time, spreading 379 the number of severe cases out over a longer period of time, and potentially also reducing 380 the total number of infections (the \"final size\") [26].

Household contacts are at a higher risk of becoming infected than non-387 household contacts as persons in a household will usually have repeated contacts. On the 388 other hand, our analyses show that household infections contribute less to onward 389 transmission than non-household infections simply because the numbers of household 390 contacts are much lower than numbers of other contacts. As a consequence, the 391 effectiveness in isolating non-household contacts is key for a successful of the model is that quantitative information about distributions of the latent and 395 infectious periods, and the infectivity per day of the infectious period can be incorporated 396 easily and detailed, such that if new and better data on those quantities emerge, the 397 analysis can be updated quickly. In particular, the model can incorporate non-standard 398 distributions based on empirical data (e.g. viral load measurements to quantify 399 infectiousness per day), should they become available.400 401",
