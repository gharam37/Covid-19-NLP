The dramatic rate of cases that progresses has created a significant strain in the national health systems of these countries and has led to a significant shortage of ICUs equipped with extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to save the lives of very critical COVID-19 cases. Since early March several European governments have implemented numerous control measures to reduce the transmission of the disease and decrease the number of new daily cases of COVID-19 so that fewer patients need to seek treatment at any given time and avoid overwhelming hospital capacity, commonly referred as \"flattening the curve\". The strategy to achieve of the flattening of the curve of COVID-19 cases in Europe has consisted of (1) early detection of new cases and primary contacts followed by self-quarantine or hospitalization, (2) promoting the adherence to hygiene standards like washing hands and (3) ",

These restrictions have put a significant burden on German society and have reduced the quality of life for most.

These simulation studies have informed decision making for national governments on how to react to this coming COVID-19 epidemic.

This decline of the growth rate is either achieved by reaching herd immunity or by implementation of measures to hinder the transmission of the virus. As soon as the impact of these measures become apparent in the decline of the daily growth rate, empirical or so-called top-down methods can be applied to model the data (e.g. logistic growth model, Gompertz model, exponential growth rate decline model).

With this new data becoming available, we have used an exponential decline of the growth rate model to analyze the trajectory of the daily growth rate [10] . Thus, we have captured and quantified the dynamics of the epidemic in these countries and described the impact on the growth rate measures have had taken. Using this approach, we have captured a specific date for both countriestwo to three weeks after the start of these measurementswhen the spread of the epidemic significantly slowed down. In a second step we have used the model to forecast the dynamics of the epidemic in Italy and Germany and to estimate the number of daily and cumulative total COVID-19 cases. This allowed us to address the question of how long the epidemic will last in both countries. In a third step we have used these forecasts of diagnosed COVID-19 cases to estimate the number of severe and critical cases for each day of April and May to provide an estimate for the daily required capacity of hospital beds, in particular ICU beds with ECMO equipment to treat the predicted severe and critical COVID-19 cases in Germany.",

We also evaluated two well established growth models, the logistic function and the Gompertz function, but decided in favor of the exponential decline model as the model structure allows to easily capture differences in the growth curve that may result from the social distancing measures. The exponential growth rate decline model defines the growth rate as ratio of new cases today versus total cases yesterday as shown in equation (1) and assumes the growth rate is following an exponential decline function given in equation (2) . The parameter \uf074 characterizes how fast the growth rate is decreasing. High values of \uf074 indicate a slow decline of the growth rate, whereas low values indicate that the growth rate is declining fast and that the ratio of new cases versus total cases will reach zero more rapidly. With the given model a logarithmic plot of the daily growth rate trajectory thus provided a straight line and allowed us to derive \uf074 from the slope by linear regression.",

We made assumptions on the fraction of mild, severe, critical or fatal COVID-19 cases and on the average length of the required hospitalization and/or intensive care for each disease state (see methods and Figure 2) . We used the observed number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases as input before April 10 th and the number of projected COVID-19 cases after April 10 th . For the projections beyond April 10 th a confidence interval is given that results from the uncertainty in the parameter identification from a linear regression. According to the model the number of severe cases requiring hospitalization is expected to peak in the first week of April at ~13,000. The maximum of ~2500 critical cases requiring intensive care with ECMO capability is expected at in the first week of April. This is in good agreement with the reported number of COVID-19 cases on ICUs in Germany of 2.405 on April 12 th [1, 11] . Based on the expected number of new COVID-19 cases we would expect that the capacity needs for severe and critical cases will decline from the 2 nd week of April onwards from ~13,500 to ~2500 (range 1500 to 4300) for hospital beds and from ~2500 to ~500 (range 300 to 800) for ICU units, respectively.

Analyzing the data from Germany and Italy allowed us to identify changes in the trajectory of the growth rate that most likely are the result from the various \"social distancing\" measures that have been implemented to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. For Italy a stronger decline in the growth rate has been observed starting around the week of March Beyond the analysis of the given data the data-driven modeling approach presented allowed to describe the observed data with a mathematical model and to provide predictions of new and cumulative COVID-19 cases for both countries. The predictions suggest that the peak of the epidemic in terms of newly diagnosed cases has passed not only in Italy (in late March), but that also in Germany (early April). Under the assumptions that the impact of the control measures on the transmission of the virus will last for the duration of the simulated time period, the total size of the epidemic can be estimated to be 155,000 cases for Germany (range 140,000 to 180,000) and to be 185,000 cases for Italy (range 175,000 to 200,000) for Italy.

First the projection for new COVID-19 cases assume a continuation of (similar) control measures of social distancing having the same impact on the growth rate of new cases. They can only provide a trend, can't be applied to project further out into the future and obviously are not able to predict the size of a second wave (or whether there would be one at all). In addition, for the calculations used above to estimate the risk for the overwhelming of the German health care system, several assumptions are based on clinical data from the epidemic in China. Evidently due to differences in the age distribution of patients and in the health system between both countries these can only be estimates for the situation in Germany. Nevertheless, it appears that several of these assumptions translate into projections of death rate and capacity needs for ICU beds that are in-line with the observed clinical findings in Germany. We estimate the total rate of fatalities per diagnosed COVID-19 case to be 2.5% for Germany, resulting from the assumption that 20% of the diagnosed cases are severe, 25% of the severe cases get critical and 50% of the critical cases are fatal. On April 12 th for 2.2% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases in Germany a fatal outcome has been reported [11] . While the epidemic is still ongoing, this formula to calculate the final death rate can be misleading and may lead to a too low number as of today the outcome is unknown for a non-negligible proportion of these diagnosed patients [18] . In other words, current deaths belong to a total case figure of the past, not to the current case figure in which the outcome (recovery or death) of a proportion (the most recent cases) hasn't yet been determined. Applying the recommended equation to calculate the case fatality ratio (CFR) by death at day D / cases at day D-X and assuming a time of 7 days between reported diagnosis and death an average death rate for Germany of ~2.9 % can be obtained from the data up to April 12 th (total death by April 12 th / total cases by April 5 th ) [10] .",

Thus, it appears to be a valuable tool for Germany or other countries to provide guidance and support decision making in the health care system with respect to how much hospital capacity is required to be well prepared for the (next) wave.",

For Germany this change in the growth rate trajectory could be the result of several measures of \"social distancing\", which have been issued since March 9 th (banning of gatherings of more than 1000 participants), March 16 th (closures of university and school closures) and March 23 rd (prohibition of gatherings of more than two people).With the given delay between infection and reported COVID-19 diagnosis of approximately 12 days itcan be hypothesized that a significant part of the observed effect on the growth rate can be attributed to the banning of larger gatherings such as soccer matches of national and international leagues.",
