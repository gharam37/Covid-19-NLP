As the epidemic threatens to overwhelm health care systems, identifying regions where the expected disease burden is likely to be high relative to the rest of the country is critical for enabling prudent and effective distribution of emergency resources. Across all global regions affected by the pandemic, an elevated risk of severe outcomes has consistently been observed in older age groups. Using age-specific mortality patterns in tandem with demographic data, we map a projection of the cumulative burden of COVID-19 and the associated cumulative burden on the healthcare system at the county-scale in the United States for a scenario in which 20% of the population of each county acquires infection. We identify regions that may be particularly impacted relative to the rest of the country, and observe a general trend that per capita disease burden and relative healthcare system demand may be highest away from major population centers.",

While precise projections of peak disease burden would be highly illuminating for informing preparation efforts, such predictions are currently unreliable given the sparsity of data, particularly serological surveys. Uncertainty in region-specific transmission rates and the efficacy of mitigation efforts (e.g., timing, or absence, of shelter-in-place orders) further complicate long-term forecasting. In contrast, projections of cumulative disease burden are considerably more tractable. Such estimates will miss the nuance of the intensity and timing of outbreaks, yet their projection of the spatial footprint of disease burden contains core information relevant to resource distribution. In particular, comparing the total expected number of critical and severe infections against healthcare resources in each county in the U.S. allows for the identification of regions which may experience relatively high disease burden. Furthermore, analyzing simulations of multiple transmission scenarios (e.g., different contact patterns) makes it possible to identify regions of consistently high disease burden without needing to project an exact epidemic trajectory over time.",

The fraction of individuals who become pre-clinically infected rather than asymptomatically infected increases with age according to published estimates 7 . Pre-symptomatic individuals eventually become symptomatic (IC). Asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals eventually recover with immunity to classes RA and RS respectively. All individuals in the infected classes (IA, IP, IC) are infectious; however, our model assumes that the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals is reduced by a factor ba, and the relative infectiousness of clinical individuals is reduced by a factor bC to account for the effects of case isolation and quarantine.",

In brief, this algorithm distributes severe and critical cases based on relative distance and the relative capacity of healthcare systems to provide care (quantified as the number of hospital beds and ICU beds respectively).

Many regions have limited, or even no, facilities with the ability to provide the type of acute or critical care needed to treat COVID-19. Case fatality rates in these regions may rise above the national average if people are unable to access care. Bolstering the capacity of rural health systems and ensuring equitable access to care should be central goals of COVID-19 management strategies. It is important to note that while the healthcare systems of major population centers aren't identified as weak spots in our analysis, they do service a much larger number of people.

To accomplish this, we varied our assumptions about the overall transmissibility of COVID-19, contact patterns between different age classes, and the contributions of clinically presenting individuals to transmission. For each set of assumptions, we simulated our model for each county in the U.S. using demography data from the 2018 American Community Survey, and extracted the number of individuals in each age class who had become symptomatically infected by the time the cumulative population infection rate had reached 20%. In the main text, we present detailed results for the most optimistic scenario and most pessimistic scenario. Summarized results for 25 other scenarios are presented in the Supplementary Materials. In the 'optimistic' scenario (transmission, R0 = 2, mixing structure, \u0398 = 1, reduction in relative infectivity of clinically presenting individuals, bC, = 0.1, see Methods for further details)",
