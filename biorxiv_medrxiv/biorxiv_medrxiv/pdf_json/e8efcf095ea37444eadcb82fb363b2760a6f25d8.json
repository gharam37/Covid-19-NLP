The goal is to extract actionable public health insights. These insights include the infectious force, the rate of a mild infection becoming serious, estimates for asymtomatic infections and predictions of new infections over time. We focus on USA data starting from the first confirmed infection on January 20 2020. Our methods reveal significant asymptomatic (hidden) infection, a lag of about 10 days, and we quantitatively confirm that the infectious force is strong with about a 0.14% transition from mild to serious infection. Our methods are efficient, robust and general, being agnostic to the specific virus and applicable to different populations or cohorts.",

            "text": "As of March 1 2020, there was still much public debate on properties of the COVID-19 pandemic (see the CNN article, Cohen (2020) ). For example, is asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 a major driver of the pandemic? There was no clear unimodal view, highlighting the need for robust tools to generate actionable quantitative intelligence on the nature of a pandemic from early and minimal data. One approach is scenario analysis. Recently, Chinazzi et al. (2020) used the Global Epidemic and Mobility Model (GLEAM) to perform infection scenario analyses on China COVID-19 data, using a networked meta-population model based on transportation hubs. A similar model for the US was reported in Wilson (2020) where the web-app predicted from 150,000 to 1.4 million infected cases by April 30, depending on the intervention level. Such scenario analysis requires user input such as infection sites and contagion-properties. However, a majority of infection sites may be hidden, especially if asymptomatic transmission is significant. Further, the contagion parameters are unknown and must be deduced, perhaps using domain expertise.",

We also follow a data-driven machine learning approach to understand early dynamics of COVID-19 on the first 54 days of US confirmed infection reports (downloadable from the European Center For Disease Control). We address the challenge of realtime data-intelligence from early data. Our approach is simple, requires minimal data or human input and generates actionable insights. For example, is asymptomatic spread significant? Our fall away from predicteds, indicating that social distancing is working in agreement with our lag of 10 days (the two \"kinks\" in the curve). The figure emphasizes early data for learning about the pandemic, as later data is \"contaminated\" by public health protocols whose effects are hard to quantify.

We observe that the model and observed counts agree, modulo two \"kinks\" around 03/24 and 03/30, when the observed infections start falling away from the model. To understand the cause, the lag is important. Aggressive social distancing was implemented on about 03/13 and lockdowns around 03/21.

The deep-blue region shows the extent to which the model is ill-identified by the data. Indeed, all these deep-blue models equally fit the data which results in a range of predictions. For robustness, we pick the white square in the middle of the deep-blue region, but note here that it is only one of the models which are consistent with the data. In making predictions, we should consider all equivalent models to get a range for the predictions that are all equally consistent with the data. Similarly, in Figure 3 (b), we fix k * and M * 0 to their optimal robust values and show the uncertainty with respect to \u03b2 and \u03b3 (the deep-blue region). Again, we pick the white square in the middle of the deep-blue region of equivalent models with respect to the data. Hence we arrive at our optimal parameters in Equation (6). By considering all models which are equally consistent with the data, we get the estimates toghether with the ranges in Equation 1. We emphasize that these error-ranges we report have nothing to do with the data, and are simply due to the ill-posedness of the inverse problem to inifer the model from finite data. Several models essentially fit the data equivalently.

Later dynamics may be contaminated by human intervention, which renders the data less useful without a more general model. We learned a lot from the early dynamics of COVID-19. It's infectious force, virulence, incubation period, unseen infections and predictions of new confirmed cases. All this, albeit within error tolerances, from a simple model and little data. Asymptomatic infection is strong, around 30%, converting to serious at a rate at most 1.2%. There is significant uncertainty in the lag, from 1 up to 13 days, and we estimate 5.3 million asymptomatic infections as of 03/14, the range being from 1 to 26 million. Such information is useful for planning and health-system preparedness. Are our parameters correct? We were in a unique position to test our predictions because our model was time-stamped as version 1 of the preprint Magdon-Ismail (2020). A side benefit of the model predictions is as a benchmark against which to evaluate public health interventions. If moving forward, observed new infections are low compared to the data in, it means the interventions are working by most likely reducing \u03b2. Starting on about March 25, the observed infections starts falling off and we observe a flattening by March 28. The US instuted broad and aggressive social distancing protocols starting on or before March 13 and even stronger lockdown around March 21, which is consistent with the data and the model's lag of k = 10. Without such quantitative targets to compare with, it would be hard to evaluate intervention protocols.",

Such lags are present in traditional machine learning, for example the delayed reward in reinforcement learning settings.
