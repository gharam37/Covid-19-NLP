Thus, it is essential to determine how we can reuse respirators and other personal protection in these urgent times. We investigated multiple commonly used and easily deployable, scalable disinfection schemes on media with particle filtration efficiency of 95%. Among these, heating (\u226485 \u00b0C) under various humidities (\u2264100% RH) was the most promising, nondestructive method for the preservation of filtration properties in meltblown fabrics as well as N95-grade respirators. Heating can be applied up to 50 cycles (85 \u00b0C, 30% RH) without observation in the degradation of meltblown filtration performance. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was a secondary choice which was able to withstand 10 cycles of treatment and showed small degradation by 20 cycles. However, UV can also potentially impact the material strength and fit of respirators. Finally, treatments involving liquids and vapors require caution, as steam, alcohol, and household bleach may all lead to degradation of the filtration efficiency, leaving the user vulnerable to the viral aerosols.",

The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first detected in Wuhan, China. 2, 3 The virus is of likely zoonotic origin, and like the SARS-CoV, enters human cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is a membrane protein that is an entry point for coronaviruses found in the lungs, heart, kidneys, and intestines that is responsible for regulating vasoconstriction and blood pressure. It was found that the SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the ACE2 more efficiently than SARS-CoV, which may explain why the human-to-human transmissibility of the virus is so high. 4 Once infected, the patient will exhibit flu-like symptoms such as fever, chest tightness, dry cough, and in some cases development into severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [5] [6] [7] [8] . As the incubation period is around 3-4 days but can be as long as 20 days, along with the presence of asymptomatic carriers, the virus has been extremely difficult to contain 9 . While the initial mortality rate was estimated to be around 3.5% in China, compounding the longer incubation period and testing delays has led to new global estimates of around 5.7% 10 .",

            "text": "While the exact mode SARS-CoV-2's viral transmission is not known, a primary mode in viruses such as SARS and influenza is known to be through short-range aerosols and droplets. 11 When a person infected with a virus breathes, speaks, sings, coughs, or sneezes micron sized aerosols containing the virus are released into the air. Data gathered from influenza patients suggest that these aerosols are typically fine (<5 \u03bcm) or coarse (>5 \u03bcm). [11] [12] [13] For coarse particles, they can settle due to gravity within an hour. Fine particles, especially smaller than 1 \u03bcm, can essentially stay nearly indefinitely in the air. Droplets, or particles >10 \u03bcm, settle rapidly and are not typically deposited in the respiratory tract through means of aerosol inhalation. Particles >5 \u03bcm typically will only reach the upper respiratory tract, and fine particles <5 \u03bcm are critically able to reach the lower respiratory tract, similar to harmful particulate matter pollution ( Figure  1 ). While coughing and sneezing do provide many aerosols, the size distribution and number of particles emitted during normal speech serve as a significant viral transmitter. 12 Singing has been found to be comparable to continuous coughing in the transmission of airborne pathogens, 14 which was demonstrated during a choir practice on March 10, 2020 in Washington State. Although the choir members did not touch each other or share music during the rehearsal, 45 out of the 60 members of the Skagit Valley Choir were diagnosed with the virus three weeks later, and two have deceased.",

            "text": "For dangerous airborne particulates, including viral aerosols during the current COVID-19 pandemic, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the usage of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFR) as personal protective equipment for healthcare professionals. [15] [16] [17] The N95 grade is determined by the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) (document 42 CFR Part 84) which designates a minimum filtration efficiency of 95% for 0.3 \u03bcm (aerodynamic mass median diameter) of sodium chloride aerosols. In addition to N95, there are N99 and N100 which correspond to filtration efficiencies of 99% and 99.97%, respectively. For oil-based aerosols (DOP), NIOSH also has created grades R and P (with filtration efficiencies 95-99.97%). Elsewhere around the globe, the equivalent filtration grades to N95 are FFP2 (European Union), KN95 (China), DS/DL2 (Japan), and KF94 (South Korea). While the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus is around 150 nm, 18 commonly found N95 respirators can offer protection against particles as small as 80 nm with 95% filtration efficiency (initial testing, not loaded). 19 With the actual viral aerosols in the ~1 \u03bcm range, the N95 FFRs' filtration efficiency should be sufficient for personal protection. The N95 FFR is comprised of multiple layers of, typically, polypropylene nonwoven fabrics (Fig. 2a) . 20 Among these layers, the most critical of which is that produced by the meltblown process. In typical FFRs, the meltblown layer is 100-1000 \u03bcm in thickness, comprised of polypropylene microfibers with a diameter in the range of ~1-10 \u03bcm, as seen in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images in Fig. 2b -c. Due to the production method, meltblown fibers produce a very lofty nonwoven where the fibers can stack and create a 3D network that has a porosity of 90%, 21 leading to very high air permeability.",

To improve the filtration efficiency while keeping the same high air permeability, these fibers are charged through corona discharge and/or triboelectric means into quasi-permanent dipoles called electrets. 22, 23 Once they are charged, the filter can significantly increase its filtration efficiency without adding any mass or density to the structure (figure 2d). In addition, while other filter media may decrease in efficiency when loading the filter with more aerosol (NaCl, DOP), the meltblown electrets are able to keep a relatively consistent efficiency throughout the test. 24 The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant shortage of N95 FFRs, 25 especially amongst healthcare providers.

While none of these methods have been extensively evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation specifically, we tested methods that can be easily deployed within a hospital setting with relatively high throughput for FFR reuse. Among the CDC forms of disinfection, we chose five commonly used and potentially scalable, user-friendly methods: 1) heat under various humidities (heat denaturation inactivates SARS-CoV with temperatures >65 \u00b0C in solution, potentially the SARS-CoV-2 with temperatures >70 \u00b0C), 28-30 2) steam (100 \u00b0C heat based denature), 3) 75% alcohol (denaturing of the virus, based on the CDC), 4) household diluted chlorine-based solution (oxidative or chemical damage, based on the CDC), and 5) ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI was able to inactivate the SARS-CoV in solution with UV-C light at a fluence of ~3.6 J/cm 2 ). 28 Using an oven, a UV-C sterilizer cabinet (found in barbershops or salons), steam, or liquid sprays can all realistically be deployed in the modern hospital setting and potentially in homes if needed.

These samples are representative of how the filtration efficiency in a N95 FFR may change given exposure to these treatments in the worst-case scenario (i.e. no protective layer of the FFR). All meltblown samples were characterized using an industry standard Automated Filter Tester 8130A (TSI, Inc.) with a flow rate of 32 L/min and NaCl aerosol (0.26 \u03bcm mass median diameter). We subjected the meltblown samples to the aforementioned five disinfection methods and summarized the data in Table 1 . From the first disinfection, we can clearly note that the solution-based methods (ethanol and chlorine-based solution) drastically degraded the filtration efficiency to unacceptable levels, while the pressure drop remained comparable. As the pressure drop remained constant, this indicated that the loftiness and structure of the meltblown was unchanged, and the resultant efficiency degradation is the result of depolarization from the quasi-permanent polarization state of the electret ( Figure S1 ). It is hypothesized in the literature that small molecules such as solvents can permeate into the fabric and liberate the charge traps or frozen charges of the electret, 32 which would decrease the filtration efficiency. It is also possible that the chlorinebased solution may also degrade the efficiency less than the alcohol-based solution due to the higher water content. As polypropylene is hydrophobic, the chlorine-based solution may have a more difficult time in the penetration into the fabric and the static charge of fibers deeper within the meltblown may be less affected.",

Similar to the alcohol and chlorine solution treatments, the pressure drop can be maintained at ~8-9 Pa, but the efficiency has degraded to around ~80%, which would be concerning in an environment with high viral aerosol concentrations. As with the solution treatments, the pressure drops remained similar, which suggests it is also due to the decay of static charge. The dwelling time and frequency may be critical for how well the static charge can be preserved. If steam treatments saturate the fibers many times and can condense water droplets on the fibers, it is possible that the static charge decays after multiple treatments. As this decay is due to the direct water molecule contact with the fibers, it may be possible to alleviate the static decay if the fibers do not come into contact with the vapor directly (sealed container, apparatus, bag, etc.) and steam only serves as the heating element. Given that steam also resulted in eventual efficiency degradation, we further determined the limits of temperature and humidity. We performed multiple humidity experiments (30%, 70%, and 100% RH) at 85 \u00b0C (20 minutes/cycle), observing that no appreciable degradation of efficiency at any humidity level (Fig. 4a-b) . At 85 \u00b0C, 30% RH, we observed no efficiency degradation over fifty cycles on a meltblown fabric (Fig. 4c-d) . Using less harsh conditions (75 \u00b0C, dry heat), the results are expectedly in agreement ( Figure S2 ). This is further confirmed when testing multiple N95-level FFRs from various countries (listed in methods) at 85 \u00b0C, 30% and 100% RH for 20 cycles (Fig. 4e-f ). Testing conditions for the FFRs were under a flow rate of 85 L/min. From all the FFRs, we observed little change in the filtration properties, as all FFRs with filtration efficiency >95% were able to retain filtration efficiencies >95% after 20 cycles of heat treatment, even in a humid environment.",

There is little to no change in the filtration efficiency and pressure drop up to 100 \u00b0C in low moisture conditions. However, at 125 \u00b0C, there is a sharp drop in the filtration efficiency while maintaining a constant pressure drop at around cycle 5. Similarly, the lack of pressure drop change indicates that the degradation is also due to the static decay. Considering the higher temperature, polypropylene's melting point (130-170 \u00b0C), as well as the thin and fibrous nature of the media, it is possible that the higher temperature is enough to relax the microscopic charge state within the polymer resulting in some of the quasi-stable polarization to become depolarized to their neutral state. From SEM images, we did not identify any morphological changes and did not observe any apparent physical deformations ( Figure S3 ), which may support this conclusion. This effect is not as strong as direct solvent contact, which reduced the filtration efficiency to <80%, while 125 \u00b0C reduced the efficiency to ~90%. The mechanism of depolarization may differ, as the solvent can liberate charge traps, but the temperature here provides energy to return some of the fibers' polarized state to a relaxed state.",

This is supported by previous experiments that showed UV-C doses up to 950 J/cm 2 did not appreciably change the filtration efficiency. 34 A possible concern regarding UVGI disinfection for FFRs is of the UV penetration depth. As UV-C has a wavelength around 250 nm, and polypropylene is a UV absorber, it is difficult to conclude if smaller viral particles deep within the filter can be deactivated through UVGI. If the particles are of a larger size and remain localized on the surface, UVGI may be a candidate for FFR reuse. Furthermore, this means that UVGI requires FFRs to not be stacked, as the incident radiation is will only be absorbed by the top-most surface. Another disadvantage is that UVGI was reported to significantly impact the mechanical strength of some FFRs with doses of around 1000 J/cm 2 . 34 Therefore, UVGI may be a useful disinfection technique, but the exact exposure or intensity of the UV-C light fluence on the mask surface would need to be verified. The variation in UVGI intensity has been the cause of discrepancies in the literature, as 3M's own internal reports recently showed that their UVGI treatments damaged particular FFRs, 35 whereas other reports show that UVGI cycling on multiple N95 FFRs had minimal or no impact. 31 While most of our tests were performed on meltblown fabrics with initial efficiency >95% due to the current shortage of FFRs, there is a definite concern over whether other FFR components (straps, valves, nosepiece, foam, etc.) can change in these treatment environments. These can impact the fit and sealing of the FFR, which is equally important as the FFR efficiency itself. From our experiments, we also used typical N95-grade FFRs to test the strap elasticity and structural integrity after heat treatments. We noted no apparent or qualitative change in the strap elasticity or fit compared with the untreated model for the heat treatments, but future quantitative studies need confirm this.",

The current shortage of N95 FFRs during this time of rapidly spreading infection may be mitigated by methods that will allow the safe reuse. We have tested methods which may be suitable for the re-use of particulate respirators, and hope our results will be useful in helping hospitals and other health care facilities in formulating safe standard operating procedures (SOPs) so that virus inactivation is assured while not compromising mask protection. While we reiterate that these methods have not been tested on SARS-CoV-2 directly for inactivation, these methods use precedents set by either SARS-CoV or general disinfection strategies. We found that of commonly deployable methods, heating (dry or in the presence humidity) <100 \u00b0C can preserve the filtration characteristics of a pristine N95 respirator. The UVGI (254 nm, 8 W) sterilizer cabinet used in these tests does not have enough dose to damage the filtration properties within a reasonable number of treatment cycles and may be considered for disinfection, however the exact dose output of the cabinet would need to be determined such that it is suitable for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 with minimal FFR damage. Using steam to disinfect requires caution, as the treatments may seem to be suitable, but prolonged treatment may leave the user with unsuitable protection. Finally, we advise against using certain liquid contact, such as alcohol solutions, chlorine-based solutions, or soaps to clean the respirator, as this will lead to a degradation in the static charge that is necessary for the FFR to meet the N95 standard.",

The resting time between cycles was 10 minutes for the 75 \u00b0C and 85 \u00b0C treatments and 5 minutes for the 100 \u00b0C and 125 \u00b0C treatments. After resting, the samples were returned to the chamber to begin the next cycle. We initially chose 75 \u2103 due to the presence of blanket warming ovens in hospital environments that can reach ~80 \u2103. Further experiments used 85 \u2103, in the event that 75 \u2103 is not enough to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Microwaving was not considered as many FFRs contain metals which may spark and melt the fabric.",
