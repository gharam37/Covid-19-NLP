On March 11 th , 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and has called for aggressive actions from all countries to fight the disease. Current research has indicated that COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a betacoronavirus similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the genetic sequence [2] . Epidemiological evidence suggests that initially reported cases in China had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market [3] [4] . With the escalated spread of the infection, there has been clear evidence of human to human transmission [5] [6] . The most common symptoms include fever, dry cough and fatigue [5] [6] [7] [8] , with presence of asymptomatic, yet contagious cases [9] .",

First, most current research on pre-existing comorbidities of COVID-19 was based on univariate comparison, which did not account for important confounders such as age and gender [17] [18] [19] [20] . Second, no studies have investigated the hazard of the identified risk factors over time, or the probability of survival at a given time. Under the rapidly changing pandemic situation, it is crucial to provide timely survival-time guidance for implementing the targeted treatment to the high-risk patients in clinical practice. Third, most existing studies on mortality risk factors were focused on patients diagnosed in Wuhan, Hubei Province, with little understanding about the mortality risk factors outside of Hubei Province. The risk factors are likely different inside and outside of Hubei Province, since current research has found that the clinical symptom severity [5] and the fatality-case rate [9, 21] to be higher in Hubei Province (the center of outbreak) than cities outside of Hubei Province in China. Fourth, no studies thus far have taken into account the pandemic stage when evaluating mortality risk factors. It has been found that average daily attack rate in China was different before and after January 11 th 2020, since non-pharmaceutical interventions were taken by the government before this date [22] . The change of pandemic stage may also influence the risk factors for fatality associated with COVID-19.",

Specifically, the inflammatory reaction following pneumonia can result in plague instability and damage in the blood vessels, where evidence of elevated local inflammation in the atherosclerotic coronary arteries following acute systemic infections have been shown in many studies [38, 40] .
