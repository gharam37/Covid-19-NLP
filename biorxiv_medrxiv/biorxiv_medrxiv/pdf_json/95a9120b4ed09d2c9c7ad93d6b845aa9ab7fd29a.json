Here we use two different sampling methods to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater over a 17-day period and sequencing is used to infer viral ancestry. While SARS-CoV-2 is detected over the entire time course, viral RNA has been steadily decreasing over the last week, suggesting that state mandated social isolation is having a measurable impact on containment of the outbreak.",

However, SARS-CoV-2 containment has been outpaced by viral spread and limited resources for testing. Moreover, mounting evidence suggests that the virus is not only spread by aerosols, but may also be transmitted via feces (Hindson, 2020; Lodder and de Roda Husman, 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b; Xu, 2020) . This has important implications for the spread of the virus and suggests that wastewater may be used to monitor progression or abetment of viral spread at the community level (Mallapaty, 2020) . To test this hypothesis, we collected three 0.5-liter samples of pre-treated wastewater from the municipal wastewater treatment plant in Bozeman, Montana (USA). Samples were collected on 7 different days over the course of a 17-day period, using two different collection methods. The samples were filtered and concentrated prior to RNA extraction. Isolated RNA was used as a template for one-step reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) according to CDC recommended guidelines (https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/ download). Each RT-qPCR reaction was performed using two primer pairs (i.e., N1, and N2), each targeting distinct regions of the nucleocapsid (N) gene from SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 1 and Supplemental Fig 1) . The first two samples were collected manually, using a sampling stick on the mornings of March 23 rd and 27 th , respectively. While samples collected on these two occasions all tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the estimated .

RNA isolated from the Bozeman waste stream on March 27 th was used as a template for RT-PCR. All 10 primer pairs produced PCR products of the expected sizes (Fig 1C) . PCR products were sequenced using Sanger methods and the reads were aligned to the reference genome using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004; Wu et al., 2020a) .

By scaling the phylogenetic data according to viral isolation dates, Hadfield et al previously showed that the G25563T mutation, which predominates specifically in France, arose more recently than the other mutations (Hadfield et al., 2018) . This suggests that the predominate strain currently circulating in Bozeman may have originated in France.

Our data indicated that the sampling method is critical and that composite samples may provide the most reliable daily average of viral concentration in wastewater over time. Bozeman is a relatively small community (~50,000) and SARS-Cov-2 was not detected in Montana until March 12 nd , 2020. While the time course presented here is relatively short, we note a statistically significant increase in SARS-Cov-2 RNA between the first (March 30 th ) and the second composite sample tested (April 1 st , 2020), and then a gradual reduction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA over the next three time points (i.e., April 3 rd , 6 th and 8 th , 2020). While temporal sampling is ongoing, the data collected thus far, reveal an encouraging trend, which suggests that community prevalence is currently on the decline.
