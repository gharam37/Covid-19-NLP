We developed a simple, MS-based method to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins from gargle solution samples of COVID-19 patients. Our protocol consists of an acetone precipitation and tryptic digestion of proteins contained within the gargle solution, followed by a targeted MS analysis. Our methodology identifies unique peptides originating from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein. Building on these promising initial results, faster MS protocols can now be developed as routine diagnostic tools for COVID-19 patients.",

Strikingly, our protocol allowed us to identify unique peptides originating from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein that were identified in two out of three samples (Figure 1 ). These results are in agreement with preceding PCR analyses, exhibiting a higher viral load in the respective samples. A peptide originating from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, comprising the sequence RPQGLPNNTASWFTALTQHGK (amino acids 41-61; Figure   2 ), was found in both samples giving first hints to its value as a potential biomarker for an MS-based COVID-19 diagnostic method. SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein packages the positive-strand viral genome RNA into a helical ribonucleocapsid and plays a fundamental role during virion assembly through its interactions with the viral genome and membrane protein M [3]. It is also important for enhancing the efficiency of subgenomic viral RNA transcription, as well as viral replication [3] . The N-gene was found to be the most expressed viral gene [4] , which is in agreement with peptides of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein being detected in our MS analysis. Clearly, further experiments are needed to test larger patient cohorts, but our findings show that SARS-CoV-2 proteins can be identified from highly diluted solutions. Our current method has the drawback of long analysis times (3 hours per sample), requiring significant optimization to be applied to high-through-put measurements of patient samples. Also, more sensitive mass spectrometric equipment will be required to allow the detection and quantification of a larger number of virus proteins. author/funder. All rights reserved.

LC/MS analysis was performed on a nano-HPLC system (UltiMate RSLC 3000) coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer with nano-ESI source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The samples were loaded onto a trapping column (Acclaim PepMap C18, 300 \u00b5m x 5 mm, 5 \u00b5m, 100\u00c5, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and washed for 15 min with 0.1 % (v/v) TFA at a flow rate of 30 \u00b5l/min. Trapped peptides were eluted using a separation column (200cm \u00b5 PAC, C18, PharmaFluidics) that had been equilibrated with 3 % B (A: 0.1 % (v/v) formic acid in water; B: 0.08 % (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile). Peptides were separated with linear gradients from 3 to 10 % B over 15 min, followed by 15 % B to 30 % B over 165 minutes. The column was kept at 30\u00b0C and the flow-rate was set to 300 nl/min. Targeted MS analysis was performed based on an inclusion list of tryptic peptides from SARS-CoV-2 proteins (see Supporting Information) [3]. In case none of the target masses from the inclusion list was detected, a TOP-5s method was applied. The resolving power in MS mode was set to 120,000 at m/z 200. A parallel data acquisition strategy was employed, relying on Orbitrap-HCD (higher energy collisioninduced dissociation, R = 15,000) and linear ion trap-CID (collision-induced dissociation)-MS/MS experiments. Database search (UniProt human, dated November 2019 with 20,315 entries, and SARS-CoV-2 [3]) was performed with Proteome Discoverer version 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The search was restricted to humanand SARS-COV-2 proteins; two missed tryptic cleavages were allowed, carbamidomethylation of Cys was set as fixed modification, while Met oxidation and deamidation of Asp, due to PNGase F treatment, were set as variable modifications. author/funder.
