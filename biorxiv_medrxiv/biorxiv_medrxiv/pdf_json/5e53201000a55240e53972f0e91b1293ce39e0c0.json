For controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, many countries have implemented two non-pharmaceutical interventions: suppression like immediate lock-downs in cities at epicentre of outbreak; or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both interventions have apparent pros and cons; the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is limited. We aimed to conduct a feasibility study for robustly estimating the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, peaks and lengths of COVID-19 breakouts by taking multiple interventions in London and the UK, accounting for reduction of healthcare demand.",

In this scenario, the total infections and deaths in the UK were limited to 2.43 million and 33.8 thousand; the peak time of healthcare demand was due to the 65 th day (April 11 th ), where it needs hospital beds for 25.3 thousand severe and critical cases. If we took a simultaneous 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in all regions of the UK, the total infections and deaths increased slightly to 2.69 million and 37 thousand; the peak time of healthcare kept the same at the 65 th day, where it needs equivalent hospital beds for severe and critical cases of 25.3 thousand. But if we released high band of rolling intervention intensity to 6 or 8 and simultaneously implemented them in all regions of the UK, the COVID-19 outbreak would not end in 1 year and distribute a multi-modal mode, where the total infections and deaths in the UK possibly reached to 16.2 million and 257 thousand.",

It was based on an observation of COVID-19 breakouts in Wuhan that a large portion (like 42.5% in Wuhan) of self-recovered population were asymptomatic or mild symptomatic. 14 They did not go to hospital for official COVID-19 tests but actually were infected. Without considering this issue, the estimation of total infections were greatly underestimated. 13 In order to measure portion of self-recovery population, we assumed that exposed individuals at home recovered in 3.5 days; mild case at home recovered in 7 days. 19 The second feature was to consider shortage of health sources (hospital beds) in the early breakouts of COVID-19 might lead to more deaths, because some severe or critical cases cannot be accommodated in time and led to death at home (non-hospital). For instance, in Wuhan, taking an immediate suppression intervention on 23 rd Jan 2020 increased serious society anxiety and led to a higher mortality rate. In order to accurately quantify deaths, our modal considered percentage of elder people in the UK at a ratio O, occupancy of available NHS hospital beds over time at a ratios H t and their availability for COVID-19 critical cases at a ratio J t . We assumed that critical cases at non-hospital places led to death in 4 days; elderly people in critical condition at hospital led to death in 14 days, and non-elderly people in critical condition at hospital led to death in 21 days. 19 One parameter was defined to measure intervention intensity over time as M t . which was presented by average number of contacts per person per day. We assumed that transmission ratio \u03b2 equals to the product of intervention intensity M t and the probability of transmission (b) when exposed (i.e., \u03b2= mb). In Wuhan, intervention intensity was assumed within [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , and gave with a relatively accurate estimation of COVID-19 breakouts. 13 We calibrated its value with respect to the population density and human mobility in London and the UK, and estimated outcomes of COVID-2019 outbreaks by implementing different interventions.",

These people might think they had been healthy at home because they did not go to hospital for COVID-19 tests. It was one important issue that some SEIR model predicted infectious population in Wuhan that 10 times over than confirmed cases. 12 Our results show that taking rolling intervention is one optimal strategy to effectively and efficiently control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK. This strategy potentially reduces the overall infections and deaths; delays and reduces peak healthcare demand. In future, our model will be extended to investigate how to optimise the timing and strength of intervention to reduce COVID-19 morality and specific healthcare demand.",

The simulated results showed the epidemic appeared a unimodal distribution trend over 350 days, longer than the period of suppression. Similar to suppression in Fig.3, the peak date of infectious population in London or non-London regions remain same at the 50 th day. After three weeks, rolling intervention with released intensity in non-London regions led to a fluctuation with 4 or 5 peaks of infections until the end of epidemic. The total deaths and infectious population in the UK were greatly reduced to a range from 33 thousand to 37 thousand. It was about 37% -54% more than the outcome of taking suppression in all the UK.",

Above two rolling interventions taken in the UK gave a similar trend of R as suppression, where there was a fast decline in R in late March, from 3 on the 46 th day (March 23 rd 2020) to 1.4 on the 230 th day (September 23 rd 2020).

The overall infections and deaths significantly increased to over 450 thousand and 60 thousand. While the peak time of healthcare demand for severe critical cases delayed to the 80 th -110 th day, the total deaths of the UK would be double than other rolling interventions with low intensity. Another finding was that given equivalent intensity (M= 3 or 5) of rolling interventions, the longer period (4 weeks) led to slight reduction of the total deaths to 36288, compared to 37432 of 3 weeks rolling and 38537 of 2 weeks rolling in the UK. The peak time of healthcare demand nearly occurred at same: the 64 th -65 th day; with an equivalent peak value. Thus, in balance of total deaths and human mobility restriction, 3 weeks of period might be a feasible choice. the length of intervention in the UK impacting on social and economic. Maintaining a period of suppression in London, it was possible to control the outbreaks at the 100 th -150 th day that minimized economic loss to the greatest extent. Due to lower population density and less human mobility of non-London regions, 3 weeks rolling intervention was appropriated to non-London regions for balancing the total infections and economic loss, but the length of this strategy was extended to 300 days.",

Due to lower population density and less human mobility, realising some intervention intensity would not lead to a second breakout of COVID-19 and benefit maintenance of business activities. Considering difference and diversity of industrial structure of London and non-London regions in the UK, hybrid intervention was more suitable and effective to control outbreaks. It could complete London outbreak with suppression in 3 months, and tolerate a longer recovery period of non-London regions taking 3 weeks rolling intervention. The rapid completion of outbreak in London would strongly benefit to economic recovery of the UK. Other regions maintained essential production and business activities to offer sufficient support to London during these 3 months. After 3 months, London could drive UK economic recovery and help other regions of the UK.",

Also, the peak time of healthcare demand would occur at the 65 th day (April 11 th 2020), where it needed sufficient hospital beds to accommodate 25.3 thousand severe and critical cases. This scenario echoed that applying suppression at a right time was crucial to delay the peak date of healthcare needs and increase available hospital beds for severe and critical cases. We found that while immediate suppression being taken in Wuhan at 3 days earlier than London reduced 3.4 times infections, it led to nearly 1.56 times of severe and critical cases at non-hospital places (Wuhan: Peak 1389 at the 43 th day, London, Peak 889 at the 57 th day). It implied that taking immediate suppression without sufficient hospital beds was risky and led to more deaths in the early breakout.Our finding revealed that implementing suppression intervention required considering other conditions of this region like culture difference, industrial structure, etc.Success of immediate suppression in Wuhan relied on strict lockdown of human mobility to community level and sufficient resource support from other cities or provinces in China. If there were no sufficiently external support, it would be risky to take highly intensive suppression to entire country due to shortage of healthcare resources and huge impacts on its economics. In the UK, it was hardly to practically implement the same level of intensity as Wuhan. If intensive suppression was relaxed at any time points, the transmission would quickly rebound. This was more like a multi-modal curve when taking multiintervention strategies in",

            "text": ".13 Early release of intensity might increase a risk of the second breakout. There are some limitations to our model and analysis. First, our model's prediction depends on an estimation of intervention intensity that is presented by averagenumber contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals in a certain region. We assumed that each intervention had equivalent or similar effect on the reproduction number in different regions over time. The practical effectiveness of implementing intervention intensity might be varied with respect to cultures or other issues of certain county. In the UK or similar countries, how to quantify intervention intensity needs an accurate measure of combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family members. As for implementing rolling interventions in the UK, the policy needs to be very specific and well-estimated at each day according to the number of confirmed cases, deaths, morality ratio, health resources, etc. Secondly, our model used a variety of plausible biological parameters for COVID-19 based on current evidence as shown inTable.1, but these assumed values might be varied by populations or countries. For instance, we assumed that average period of mild cases to critical cases is 7 days, and average period of elderly people in hospital from severe cases to deaths was 14 days, etc. The change of these variables may impact on our estimation of infections and deaths in the UK. Lastly, our model assumes a condition that there will be a reasonable growth of available hospital source as time goes in the UK after 23 rd March 2020.
