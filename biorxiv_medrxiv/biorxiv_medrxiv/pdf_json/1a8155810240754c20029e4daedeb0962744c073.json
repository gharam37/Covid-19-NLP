While many clinical trials are underway to test the efficacy of HCQ as a treatment for COVID-19, underlying mechanisms of HCQ in the setting of COVID-19 remain unclear. Hence, we examined differential gene expression signatures of HCQ exposure, in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection, and host signatures of COVID-19 in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage, and postmortem lung to evaluate whether HCQ transcriptome signatures associate with restoration of SARS-CoV-2-related host transcriptional responses. Here, we show that 24 hours of in vitro treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) with HCQ significantly impacted transcription of 16 genes involved in immune regulation and lipid metabolism. Using transcriptome data from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE and A549 cells and PBMC derived from confirmed COVID-19 infected patients, we determined that only 0.24% of the COVID-19 PBMC differentially expressed gene set and 0.39% of the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 cells differentially expressed gene set overlapped with HCQ-related differentially expressed genes. Moreover, we observed that HCQ treatment significantly impacted transcription of 159 genes in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages involved in cholesterol biosynthetic process and chemokine activity. Notably, when we compared the macrophage HCQ-related gene lists with genes transcriptionally altered during SARS-CoV-2 infection and in bronchoalveolar lavage of COVID-19+ patients, the CXCL6 gene was impacted in all three transcriptional signatures revealing evidence in favor of chemokine modulation. HCQrelated transcriptional changes minimally overlapped with host genes altered in postmortem lung biopsies from COVID-19 participants. These results may provide insight into the immunomodulation mechanisms of HCQ treatment in the setting of COVID-19 and suggest HCQ is not a panacea to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

The most significant difference was observed for the IL1R2 gene linked to immune regulation [8] , which was downregulated with HCQ treatment. Transcription of IL1R2 has been reported to be significantly upregulated in monocytes from individuals with chronic graft-versus host disease [9] suggesting HCQ may exert antiinflammatory effects. Notably, we observed that the chemokine CCL22 gene was significantly down regulated after 24 hours of HCQ treatment as compared to the untreated condition (Fig.1a) . CCL22 codes for a CC cytokine that is involved in chemotactic activity for monocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and activated T cells. Other genes that were significantly differently expressed comparing the untreated and HCQ treated conditions included SEMA3G, FN1, MSMO1, ARHGEF28, SLC1A2, PHOSPHO1, ENC1, CPNE6, SCD, NDRG2, LDLR, A2M, AQP9, and CYP51A1. Pathway analyses of this gene set using the Enrichr gene enrichment analysis tool [10] showed that the top pathways involved lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, SREBF and miR-33 in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis, lipoprotein metabolism, and steroid biosynthesis (Supplemental Data 1). These in vitro data suggest that 24 hour in vitro treatment with HCQ minimally impacts immune gene transcription and support findings that HCQ has potential immunomodulatory and lipid metabolism effects [11] . Specifically, previous work from in vivo studies has reported that HCQ treatment significantly decreased serum TNF-A and increased IL-10 levels in women following treatment with 400mg/per day orally [12] and inhibited IL-1\u03b2 production from stimulated human neutrophils [13] . In the context of COVID-19 infection, clinical reports indicate severe patients exhibit a well-known immune cytokine storm that leads to multi-organ failure [14, 15] . Ongoing clinical trials will see if in addition to hypothesized in vivo viral impacts of HCQ whether this drug also averts the likelihood for a cytokine storm.",

We first sought to confirm the observed immunological changes observed during COVID-19 disease in peripheral blood by others [15, [21] [22] [23] [24] . We utilized the bulk transcriptome PBMC data and estimated the abundances of 22 immune cell types using the CIBERSORT analytical deconvolution tool [25] . Similar to other reports, we observed a drastic expansion of monocyte cells in peripheral blood of COVID-19 participants (75.3%, 46.4%, and 57.4%) compared to controls (19.8%, 5.6%, and 26.8%) using an estimation of member cell types in PBMC based on gene expression data ( Fig. 2a, Supplemental Figure 2) . Also, we saw that CD4 memory resting cells and NK cells resting drastically reduced in all three COVID-19 participants compared to controls (Fig. 2a, Supplemental Figure 2 ). differentially expressed genes related to COVID-19, we identified that only 5 genes overlapped between the gene set of HCQ-related transcriptional changes and COVID-19-related transcriptional changes in PBMC (Fig.   2b ). This accounted for only 0.24% of the host related COVID-19 transcriptional changes in PBMC, suggesting HCQ minimally restores/impacts COVID-19-related transcriptional immune changes. In the HCQ PBMC transcriptional dataset, we observed that the IL1R2, FN1, and A2M were significantly downregulated and LDLR and SCD gene were significantly upregulated (Fig.2c ). In the COVID-19 PBMC transcriptional dataset, we observed that the LDLR gene was significantly upregulated similar to the SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection dataset for NHBE (Fig.2d) . Additionally, in the COVID-19 PBMC dataset, the IL1R2, FN1, and SCD genes were significantly upregulated compared to a significant downregulation of the A2M gene (Fig.2d) . These results should be taken with caution as studies are needed comparing PBMC cells from COVID-19 participants before and after HCQ treatment. Additionally, whether the directionally of transcriptional change in PBMC cells due to HCQ treatment or related to COVID-19 has any immunomodulatory effect leading to clinical benefits requires further study. This comparative analysis is limited and does not address whether HCQ has antiviral effects by reducing SARS-CoV-2 virus entry through impacting cell lipid metabolism pathways since author/funder.

We preliminarily confirmed that PBMC cells do not harbor SARS-CoV-2 virus by mapping RNA-Seq reads from COVID-19 PBMC samples and identifying no significant reads aligning to the SARS-CoV-2 reference (Supplemental Figure 3b) . This was also observed by Xiong et al. [20] . In contrast, we observed viral mapping of reads in the Blanco-Melo et al. in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection dataset of A549 and NHBE cells (Supplemental Figure 3c,d) . Notably, the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection dataset contains a 3' bias of read alignment compared to the COVID-19 PBMC dataset. Recent in vitro work suggest SARS-CoV-2 infects T lymphocytes [26] . Whether this is observable in COVID-19 patient remains to be determined. We assume HCQ treatment of A549 or NHBE cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection would dramatically reduce the viral mapping detected by RNA-Seq. Our observations of overlapping transcriptional changes provides candidate genes to further study for addressing host immune-related mechanisms of action of HCQ in the setting of COVID-19.",

Together, these findings suggest that modulation of myeloid cells may have an impact on SARS-CoV-2-related host responses.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples predominantly contain macrophages with only a minor population of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. We used CIBERSORT to confirm that the majority population in the transcriptome dataset was macrophage cell types (Supplemental Figure 5) . Additionally, we confirmed that the BAL transcriptome dataset from COVID-19 participants contained high levels of SARS-CoV-2 virus by mapping reads to the viral reference (Supplemental Figure 3a) .

We sought to examine whether the differential gene expression signatures of HCQ in immune cells associated with a COVID-19related transcriptional profile in the lung. We analyzed a limited transcriptomic data from postmortem lung biopsies obtained from two male participants with COVID-19 over the age of 60 years and two uninfected agematched control male participants (Supplemental Table 1 ). The COVID-19 and uninfected control participants were confirmed to not have been on HCQ treatment. As expected, we also detected 108 viral SARS-CoV-2 reads in the bulk RNA-Seq lung dataset of one of the COVID-19 individuals and 7 viral SARS-CoV-2 reads in the second COVID-19 participant (Supplemental Figure 6) . These results are limited by the low sequencing depth and 3' bias but do offer an interesting means to confirm COVID-19 infection by RNA-seq screening in postmortem samples. Our comparative analysis of the both PBMC and macrophage HCQ-treated gene sets with the COVID-19 postmortem lung transcriptional dataset identified only 5 overlapping genes (Fig.5a) . This overlap included CCL18, FOS, MMP1, ITGB3, and AQP9 genes. Notably, our gene ontology analysis of the COVID-19 postmortem lung dataset showed the top GO Biological Process as negative regulation of viral genome replication, GO Molecular Function as chemokine activity, and GO Cellular Component as secretory granule lumen. Additionally, we used CIBERSORT [25] to examine the immune cell populations in COVID-19 lung compared to uninfected lung (Supplemental Figure 7) . This deconvolution analysis showed some interesting initial differences of interest for further study. First, the relative fraction of CD4 memory resting T cells was 15% and 19% in the uninfected lungs compared to only 3% and 4% for the COVID-19 lung. Second, author/funder. All rights reserved.

These results support the notion of continual neutrophil influx into the lung in the setting of COVID-19 during sustained and persistent inflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion [31] .

While these results are limited by the low sample size, they do provide evidence for certain areas of future investigation.

Notably, these alterations were more apparent in macrophage cells compared with bulk PBMC cells treated with HCQ. Our study is a start to address mechanisms of action for whether HCQ is an effective therapy for COVID-19. While these findings are of interest to studies of HCQ and COVID-19, transcriptional studies need to be conducted on in vivo treatment of COVID-19 participants before and after HCQ treatment. The mechanisms of action of HCQ in the setting of viral infection remains an area still under investigation and a research area containing contrasting findings. This is supported by previous HCQ research in the setting of HIV that reported HCQ treatment drastically reduced immune activation in HIVinfected individuals [32] . In contrast to these findings, a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial of 400 mg of HCQ failed to find any difference in T cell activation and reported increased viral replication [33] . While in vitro data of SARS-CoV-2 provide compelling rationale for suggesting clinical efficacy of HCQ [4, 34] , in vivo data and randomized double blinded placebo COVID-19 studies of HCQ are needed to account of contextdependent effects of the host being administered HCQ. Further work will need to determine whether the mechanism of action of HCQ is directly impacting SARS-CoV-2 or indirectly impacting the immune system and hence indiscriminately improving COVID-19 clinical outcomes. Unfortunately, at this moment HCQ is not a panacea for COVID-19 and alternative therapies are urgently needed. author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
