We performed an internet-based, region-stratified survey among 352 HCWs and 189 individuals in the general population enrolled on March 17 th and 18 th 2020 from 26 Chinese provinces. The HCWs developed a more in-depth understanding of SARS-Coronavirus-2 infection and showed a higher tolerance to the future vaccination than the general population. 76.4% of HCWs (vs. 72.5% in the general) showed their willingness to receive vaccination. Potential benefits from COVID-19 outbreak such as seeking influenza (65.3%) or pneumonia (55.7%) vaccination can be gained in HCWs. To estimate the relative effects of attributes influencing vaccination choice in the discrete choice experiment, 7 attributes (3 disease-relevant, 3 vaccine-relevant, and 1 of social acceptance) were identified as key determinants. Among them, disease trend (odds ratio, OR: 4.367 (95%CI, 3.721-5.126) for seasonal epidemic, OR: 3.069 (2.612-3.605) for persistent epidemic, with reference to disappearance in summer), social contacts' decisions (0.398: 0.339-0.467 for refusal, 0.414: 0.353-0.487 for neutral, with reference to acceptance) and high possibility of being infected (2.076: 1.776-2.425 for infection probability of 30%+ ) were significantly associated with increased probability of choosing vaccination in the HCWs. In contrast, for the general population, vaccine safety and social contacts' decisions were the most important predictors. For COVID-19",

In our study, nearly 20% of the HCWs and 25% of the general population are hesitant about COVID-19 vaccination, which may be a hinder to establish herd immunity within the population. A lack of preparedness for advising patients about vaccination and a lack of training are inhibiting factors for recommending the vaccine.

Then the selected profiles were randomly distributed to 8 choice sets, each comprised of two hypothetical profiles (Scenario A and Scenario B). For each choice set, all participants were invited to make their COVID-19 vaccination decisions from either scenario A or B. An extra choice set was established to identify subjects being potentially 'irrational' or unable to understand the choices, in which scenario A instead of B would be logically chosen for sensitive analysis.",

This indicates that disease trend in the future and high possibility of being infected may increase the importance of disease-relevant attributes relative to vaccine-attributes in the decision-making of HCWs.Similar or weaker effects of attributes on vaccination preference were found in the general population. However, general population seems to focus more on vaccine safety (OR:2.3), social contacts' decisions (OR:4.7 and 2.1) and case-fatality ratio (OR:1.3) than HCWs.",

Further potential benefits from the epidemic such as influenza or pneumonia vaccination can be gained from the epidemic. Disease trend, social contacts' decisions and high possibility of being infected are significantly associated with increased probability of choosing vaccination among HCWs, while for the general population, vaccine safety and social contacts' decisions are the most important predictors. Most HCWs (3/4) showed their willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccination after introduction, which, to a large extent, is due to the risk evaluation of infection and confidence in the effectiveness and safety of vaccine.

Basically, different fromHCWs from western countries who are hesitant to the vaccine itself, 60% Chinese HCWs focus on the less strict quality control during the production instead of vaccines. Incidences of vaccines such as Changchun Changsheng Biotech reported in China in the past decade may lead to the decline of confidence in domestic vaccines among the Chinese including HCWs(27, 28). Similar to human body's immune memory and reactivation in the way vaccine works, HCWs or the public will show much more grief and indignation towards the future COVID-19 vaccine if serious adverse events are reported after vaccine introduction.",

This is in accordance with what has been reported in other vaccine preventable diseases such as influenza(16).
