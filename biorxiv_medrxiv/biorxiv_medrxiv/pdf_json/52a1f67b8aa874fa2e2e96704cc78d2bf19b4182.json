Ventilator sharing has been suggested as a crisis standard of care strategy to increase availability of mechanical ventilation. The safety and practicality of shared ventilation in patients is unknown. We designed and evaluated a system whereby one mechanical ventilator can be used to simultaneously ventilate two patients who have different lung compliances using a custom manufactured flow control valve to allow for individual adjustment of tidal volume and airway pressure for each patient.",

This equates to nearly 50% of intubated patients continuing to require ventilatory support. Although the MSHS currently has enough ventilators to meet demand, the slow but steady rise in the number of intubated patients requiring prolonged ventilation is concerning. As this pandemic now spreads throughout the country and around the globe, especially in developing countries, tens of thousands more such patients are expected, leading to even greater concern that there will be insufficient ventilators to meet demand. 3 The United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps published a statement that a possible crisis standard of care strategy is the ventilation of two patients with a single mechanical ventilator. 4 The document described the challenges that must be overcome, and asserted that such a strategy should only be considered as an absolute last resort. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

The patients were required to have similar minute ventilation, PEEP, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) requirements. Informed Consent and Permission for Emergency Procedure with an Unapproved Article was obtained from the legally authorized representative of both patients prior to beginning the study. The patients were moved into the same room in an intensive care unit and connected to full physiologic monitoring. Each patient was placed on pressure control ventilation with the same respiratory rate, PEEP, and FiO 2 . The driving pressure of each patient's ventilator was adjusted to achieve a tidal volume of 4-6 ml/kg of IBW.

The adjustable flow valves allow the pressure and volume delivered to each patient to be continuously individualized and titrated to changes in compliance. Appropriately-placed spirometry sensors enable accurate measurement of the delivered tidal volume, airway pressure, compliance, and end-tidal CO 2 for each patient individually.

            "text": "Even if all patients connected to a single ventilator have the same clinical features at initiation, they could deteriorate and recover at different rates, and distribution of gas to each patient would be unequal and unmonitored. The sickest patient would get the smallest tidal volume and the improving patient would get the largest tidal volume. The greatest risks occur with sudden deterioration of a single patient (e.g., pneumothorax, kinked endotracheal tube), with the balance of ventilation distributed to the other patients. The use of flow control valves and individual patient monitoring and alarms overcome these risks. 10. Finally, there are ethical issues. If the ventilator can be lifesaving for a single individual, using it on more than one patient at a time risks life-threatening treatment failure for all of them.",
