Our review indicates proposed models are poorly reported and at high risk of bias. Thus, their reported performance is likely optimistic and using them to support medical decision making is not advised. We call for immediate sharing of the individual participant data from COVID-19 studies to support collaborative efforts in building more rigorously developed prediction models and validating (evaluating) existing models. The aforementioned predictors identified in multiple included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models. We also stress the need to follow methodological guidance when developing and validating prediction models, as unreliable predictions may cause more harm than benefit when used to guide clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD statement to facilitate validating, appraising, advocating and clinically using the reported models.",

All models reported good to even excellent predictive performance, but all were appraised as high risk of bias, due to a combination of poor reporting and poor methodological conduct for participant selection, predictor description and statistical methods used. As expected, in these early COVID-19 related prediction model studies, clinical data from COVID-19 patients is still scarce and limited to data from China, Italy, and international registries. With few exceptions, the available sample size and number of events for the outcomes of interest were limited, which is a known problem for building prediction models, increasing the risk of overfitting the prediction model. 39 A high risk of bias implies that these models are likely to perform worse in practice than the performance that is reported by the researchers. Hence, the estimated C-indices, often close to 1 and indicating near-perfect discrimination, are highly likely to be optimistic. Five studies carried out an external validation, 7 12 25 32 22 and only one study assessed calibration correctly. 7 We reviewed thirteen studies that used advanced machine learning methodology on chest CT scans to diagnose COVID-19 disease, COVID-19 related pneumonia, or to assist in segmentation of lung images. The predictive performance measures showed a high to almost perfect ability to identify COVID-19, although these models and their evaluations also suffered from a high risk of bias, notably due to poor reporting and an artificial mix of COVID-19 cases and non-cases.",

It is therefore key to identify a target population in which predictions serve a clinical need, and a representative dataset (preferably comprising consecutive patients) on which the prediction model can be developed and validated. This target population must also be carefully described such that the performance of the developed or validated model can be appraised in context, and users know in which individuals the model can be applied to make predictions. However, the included studies in our systematic review often lacked an adequate description of the study population, which leaves users of these models in doubt of the models' applicability. While we recognize that all studies were done under severe time constraints caused by urgency, we recommend that any studies currently in preprint and all future studies should adhere to the TRIPOD reporting guideline 15 to improve the description of their study population as well as their modeling choices.

If study participants have neither recovered nor died within that time period, their data should not be excluded from analysis, as most reviewed studies have done. Instead, an appropriate time-to-event analysis should be considered to allow for administrative censoring. 16 It should be noted that censoring due to other reasons, for instance due to quick recovery and loss to follow-up of patients that are no longer at risk of death from COVID-19, may necessitate analysis in a competing risk framework. 42 Instead of developing and updating predictions in their local setting, Individual Participant Data (IPD) from multiple countries and healthcare systems may facilitate better understanding of the generalizability and implementation prediction models across different settings and populations, and may greatly improve their applicability and robustness in routine care. [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] The evidence base for the development and validation of prediction models related to COVID-19 will quickly increase over the coming months. Together with the increasing evidence from predictor finding studies [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] and open peer review initiatives for COVID-19 related publications, 55 data registries 56-60 are being set up. To maximize the new opportunities and to facilitate IPD meta-analyses, the WHO has recently released a new data platform to encourage sharing of anonymized COVID-19 clinical data. 61 To leverage the full potential of these evolutions, international and interdisciplinary collaboration in terms of data acquisition and model building is crucial.",

Due to differences between health care systems (e.g., Chinese and European) in admission, discharge, and testing criteria for patients with COVID-19, we anticipate most existing models will need to be updated (i.e., adjusted to the local setting).",

This is especially true for datasets with limited sample size. 66 Based on the predictors included in multiple models identified by our review, we encourage researchers to consider incorporating the following as candidate predictors: (i) for diagnostic models -age, body temperature, and (respiratory) signs and symptoms; (ii) for prognostic models -age, sex, Creactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, lymphocyte count, and potentially features derived from CT-scoring. Predictors that were included in both a diagnostic and a prognostic model were albumin (or albumin/globin), direct bilirubin, and red blood cell distribution width; these could be considered as well. By pointing to the most important methodological challenges and issues in design and reporting of the currently available models, we hope to have provided a useful starting point for further studies aiming at developing new models or validating and updating existing ones.",
