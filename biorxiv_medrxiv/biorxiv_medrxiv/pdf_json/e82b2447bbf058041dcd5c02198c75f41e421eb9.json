            "text": "Due to supply chain disruption, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe shortages in personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care professionals. Local fabrication based on 3D printing is one way to address this challenge, particularly in the case of simple products such as protective face shields. As a consequence, many public domain designs for face shields have become available. No clear path exists, however, for introducing a locally fabricated and unapproved product into a clinical setting. In a US health care setting, face shields are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); similar policies exist in other countries. We describe a research protocol under which rapid iteration on an existing design, coupled with clinical feedback and real-world testing in an emergency department, allowed a face shield to be implemented by the members of the incident command team at a major academic medical center. We describe our design and testing process and provide an overview of regulatory considerations associated with fabrication and testing of face shields and related products. All designs, materials used, testing protocols, and survey results are reported in full to facilitate the execution of similar face shield efforts in other clinical settings. Our work serves as a case study for development of a robust local response to pandemics and other health care emergencies, with implications for healthcare professionals, hospital administrators, regulatory agencies and concerned citizens.",

The origins of these shortages are varied but reflect the fragility of medical supply chains in which relatively few international vendors dominate many critical medical product areas. Because many hospitals use just-in-time inventory management, supply chain problems rapidly deplete hospital supplies and prevent restocking from traditional vendors. Faced with this crisis, many caregivers and medical centers have turned to local fabricators to see if they can provide replacements for products such as face shields, filtering respirators, and even ventilators. The substitution of conventionally sourced products with non-traditional local products is made feasible by rapid expansion in inexpensive additive manufacturing capabilities (\"3D printing\") by small business and hobbyist (\"maker\") communities. Computer-aided design (CAD) software has also become widely available, making it possible to share designs in public forums, including the NIH 3D Print Exchange 1 . This has resulted in dozens of open-sourced designs, online videos, and blogs dedicated to fabricating different types of PPE.",

We discuss how hospital systems can most effectively test and make use of alternative or innovative products in the face of lifethreatening disease while ensuring staff and patient safety. This is a critical issue. Multiple projects led by small companies and citizens are asking how the PPE they have fabricated can be provided to hospitals in need -the 'last mile' of the supply chain. We review the regulatory guidance on this issue and explore the life cycle of a product implemented in a crisis situation, including whether a product adopted in crisis should remain in inventory after the crises has passed.",

Although they are simple appearing devices they are subject to regulation. In the US, the ANSI/ISEA Z.87.1-2015 standard specifies nearly twenty required physical features of a face shield and testing requirements for visual resolving power, resistance to high-velocity impacts, and protection from droplets and splashes. Similar standards exist in Europe and other countries. The need for such standards is obvious given that defective face shields can expose users, particularly those in industry, to serious and life-threatening injuries (e.g., in welding). In a health care setting, face shields are categorized as Class I medical devices, the least-regulated FDA category.",

The FDA (and in some cases the CDC) maintain a list of approved products 4 . Unlike more complex medical products, a 510(k) filing is not required; 510(k) filings require a demonstration that a device is substantially equivalent to an existing, legally marketed device. Except in rare circumstances, local manufacturers, maker communities and hospitals are unlikely to have the necessary expertise to test face shields to ANSI/ISEA Z.87.1-2015. However, as of April 2020, the FDA has provided guidance that it \"does not intend to object to individuals' distribution and use of improvised PPE when no alternatives, such as FDA-cleared masks or respirators, are available.\" 5 This provides a regulatory framework in which to use locally fabricated (\"improvised\") PPE, but it does not address a critical question: how can these devices be introduced into the hospital supply chain in a rational, safe and controlled manner?",

These designs have been introduced with different use cases in mind. Unlike industrial face shields, which can be expensive and are often used for extended periods of time, the vast majority of medical face shields are low-cost and intended to be discarded after a single use. Some nonregulated designs (e.g. from Prusa 6 ) are intended for multiple uses and are potentially superior in fit and function to regulated disposable face shields. As a practical matter, at a time when PPE is in extremely short supply, even lower-quality face shields are unlikely to be discarded after a single use. This raises questions about procedures for face shield sterilization, which also requires testing and evaluation.",

The use of a research protocol made it possible to introduce an untested device, and ready it for deployment, in advance of FDA guidance and in a manner that greatly increased the confidence of hospital leadership. All of the designs and protocols generated through this effort are being freely shared for reuse and improvement, and the results for our testing at the BWH emergency department are reported in 3 full to facilitate the execution of similar face shield efforts in other clinical settings.

Our design, shown in Figure 2B , is similar in many respects to the DtM-v3.1 face shield which was subsequently released via the NIH 3D Print Exchange 8 . The similarity between the DtM-v3.1and the PanFab design is a result of convergence on a core set of features, the consistency of feedback across health care staff, and the applicability of the design to other health care settings. Expert user feedback was an essential part of the process. For example, potential users were concerned that the original Prusa design did not provide adequate liquid protection at the top and sides of the visor. We therefore added a fin above the headband to prevent fluid from entering the top of the face shield during high-risk procedures in which a clinician is required to lean forward; this includes endotracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation, one of the riskier procedures that must be performed on COVID-19 patients. We also added a lip above the visor so that any liquid that did fall on the fin would be retained by the lip and would not spread over the visor and affect a user's ability to see through the face shield. Overall, four substantial design modifications were made based on clinical feedback, as outlined in Table 2 .",

The resulting BWH/PanFab Mk 1.0 face shield provides protection from spray in a reusable design that can be cleaned using standard hospital disinfectants. Using a team that self-organized on-line in response to a request of hospital incident command, PanFab was able to proceed from project inception to implementation in three weeks. Critically, using a clinical testing approach, we were able to introduce a nontraditionally manufactured product into a hospital supply chain. To date, we have fabricated hundreds of face shields, all of which remain in use, and we expect to introduce an additional thousand face shields within the coming weeks. Keys to successful integration of this face shield in the hospital setting included a dedicated liaison within incident command, the willingness of the IRB to work closely and quickly with designers, and the ability of the BWH legal and leadership teams to act quickly on policy issues. With a design in hand, we expect that others can deploy the solution we describe in as little as two weeks, plus 2-3 days for clinical testing (if required). In some cases, teams seeking to replicate our approach will need to modify the PanFab design due to shortages of raw materials or differences in fabrication capabilities. Under these circumstances, additional user testing under an IRB protocol might be required.",

We note however that design and testing standards are not freely available (they currently cost several hundred USD) and testing represents a substantial additional expense. Nonetheless, having a set of tested and approved designs would increase resiliency during a public health emergency such as COVID-19. Finally, we are testing various procedures for decontaminating and reusing face shields and similar PPE.

Alternative approaches include rotary die cutting to produce the face shield transparent visors and injection molding to fabricate the headband and support bracket. The transition from laser-cutting to rotary die cutting is straightforward, but injection molding the headband will require several adjustments to the design. This includes subtly changing the shapes of specific elements and selecting appropriate materials. Once complete, engineers can leverage the expertise of a company specialized in rapid-turnaround injection molding (e.g. Protolabs, Xcentric Mold in the US and similar companies in Europe and Asia) and quickly reach larger-scale production. In addition to enabling higher volume production than 3D printing, injection molding creates a more consistent product that is more likely to pass ANSI/ISEA testing. Injection molded parts can also be sterilized using a range of technologies whereas concerns have been raised about sterilization of 3D FFF parts made from PLA. 11 9",

In the current crisis, face shields are a likely prelude to testing and introduction of products in which safety considerations are more critical such as ventilator splitters. An IRB-approved protocol was used in the current study because we performed a user survey. However, use of a research protocol in this setting may have wider applicability if we consider a non-traditionally manufactured face shield as an Investigational Device. For non-significant risk devices such as face shields, the FDA authorizes IRBs to conduct the necessary risk assessment, and an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) is not likely to be required from the FDA. We note however, that the relevant US regulations in 21 CFR 812.2 do not cover circumstances in which a normally approved device (i.e., a face shield meeting ANSI/ISEA Z.87.1-2015) that has become unavailable might have a non-approved variant (i.e., the PanFab face shield) that would be tested via research protocol.

Community-level disaster resilience is well-recognized as essential in responses to both natural disasters and public health emergencies, 14 but the role of local manufacturing and maker communities in medical supply chains has not previously been considered part of such resiliency. We strongly believe that this should change and that such change will require refinement of regulatory and institutional policies. Hospitals should integrate individuals with engineering and manufacturing expertise into their incident command structure and prioritize longitudinal relationships with the local fabrication and maker communities well before an emergency happens. Our experience highlights the fact that individuals with the necessary medical, engineering and managerial experience already exist in many academic medical centers; such individuals need to be included in future pandemic planning.",

Studies over a period of at least 15 years by the US National Academies of Sciences and other US government bodies 15 have repeatedly highlighted the need for innovation in PPE but little has changed. Practitioners and ordinary citizens should demand a much more transparent and distributed system for providing essential medical products of all types. Designs for key products should be tested clinically and published in peer-reviewed journals and demonstrated to meet existing fabrication standards well in advance. Unpatented designs for essential medical products should be made publicly available under nonrestrictive Creative Commons or similar licenses. Patented designs should be placed in a patent pool for free use during public health emergencies or be subject to compulsory licensing at a reasonable cost. National suppliers and local fabricators must be compensated for their work but in extreme cases, 28 U.S. Code \u00a7 1498 (\"Section 1498\") gives the US Federal government the \"right to use patented inventions without permission, while paying the patent holder 'reasonable and entire compensation',\" with immunity from patent claims. The current crisis has shown that, when a pandemic is spreading, and health care workers are placed at high risk, we require a distributed and robust community level approach to essential medical supplies, not a secretive and centralized one. The resulting devices, developed and produced largely by volunteers, are not only likely to decrease the risk of hospital infection in the current example, but also send a powerful message to front-line medical staff that the local community stands behind them. Although a pandemic was required to galvanize these insights and promote rapid change, our hope is that the spirit of thoughtful collaboration and rapid innovation does not dissipate once the world returns to its pre-COVID-19 state.",
