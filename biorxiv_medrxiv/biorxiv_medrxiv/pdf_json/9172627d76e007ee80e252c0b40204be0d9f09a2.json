Although there are several potential therapeutic targets to repurpose the existing antiviral agents or develop effective interventions against this novel coronavirus [6] , toxicology and clinical trials are required for potential uses in the clinic. According to the pathological reports for COVID-19, it was shown that SARS-CoV-2 mainly caused inflammatory responses in the lungs [7] . Several studies showed that COVID-19 patients developed lymphopenia and rising pro-inflammatory cytokines in severe cases [8, 9] . Inflammation can be triggered when innate and adaptive immune cells detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. Innate T cells can provide a first line of defense against pathogens.

During acute HIV infection, previous studies showed that the surface expression of the activation marker, CD25, is significantly increased on \u03b3 \u03b4 T cells [14] , whereas various viruses may have different effects on the patterns of \u03b3 \u03b4 T cells activation [17, 18] .",

We showed that upon infection, the percentage of \u03b3 \u03b4 T cells in the peripheral blood isolated from COVID-19 patients was drastically decreased when compared with healthy donors ( Figure 1A ). Although in the acute or early stages of other viral infections\uff0c the percentage of \u03b3 \u03b4 T cells increased, we observed a decrease of \u03b3 \u03b4 T cells in symptomatic patients. This might be explained that various types of virus impact \u03b3 \u03b4 T cells in different ways. It is likely that \u03b3 \u03b4 T cell response, including proliferation and cellularity, is dependent on the specific types of viral infections. It is also possible that most patients in this study showed mild symptom besides fever, as opposed to serious illness featuring pneumonia.",
