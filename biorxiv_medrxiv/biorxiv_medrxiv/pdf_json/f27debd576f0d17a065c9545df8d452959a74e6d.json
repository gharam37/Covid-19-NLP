Recently, messenger RNAs (mRNAs) have emerged as a promising platform for vaccination. Here, we systematically investigated the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs in order to enhance protein production. Through a comprehensive analysis of endogenous gene expression and de novo design of UTRs, we identified the optimal combination of 5' and 3' UTR, termed as NASAR, which was five to ten-fold more efficient than the tested endogenous UTRs. More importantly, NASAR mRNAs delivered by lipid-derived nanoparticles showed dramatic expression of potential SARS-CoV-2 antigens both in vitro and in vivo. These NASAR mRNAs merit further development as alternative SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

            "text": "Vaccine is the most effective strategy to prevent viral infections for a large population 4 . Different types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines such as mRNA, DNA, and recombinant proteinbased antigens are currently in clinical trials 5 . Among these agents, mRNA-based vaccine candidates first entered the clinical trial, because of the fast process for developing and manufacturing mRNA 6 . To express an antigen effectively, an mRNA requires several essential components, including 5' cap, 5' untranslated region (5' UTR), antigen-encoding sequence, 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) , and polyadenylated tail 7 . Among these components, the 5' UTR and 3' UTR are unique regulators for protein translation 8 . The design and selection of 5' UTR and 3' UTR are critically important to ensure the sufficient production of antigens and efficacious vaccination of the host 9 . Therefore, systematic explorations of UTRs may provide broad applicability for mRNA vaccines in response to emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies utilized many UTRs from endogenous genes for protein expression 8, 10, 11 . For example, the UTRs from human cytochrome B-245 alpha polypeptide (CYBA) outperformed several other UTRs for protein expression 12 . The 5' UTR from alpha globin mRNA enabled higher translation efficiency than that from beta globin mRNA in cells 13 . Alternatively, UTRs can be designed via a de novo method. A recent study reported a series of 5'UTRs consisting of 12-14 nucleotides (nt) 14 . Also, a deep learning method was applied to screen and analyze a large set of 5'UTRs 15 . Based on these significant advances, we hypothesize that the integration of endogenous UTRs with further de novo design may be a superior approach for UTRs engineering, facilitating the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (Fig. 1) . Our results prove the concept of this approach and significantly increase protein production compared to the UTRs reported in the literatures 12, [16] [17] [18] . Lastly, a series of potential SARS-CoV-2 antigens are visualized via fluorescent imaging in both cell and animal models, which may serve as vaccine candidates for the clinical trials. Figure 1 .

            "text": "To screen endogenous UTRs in mammalian cells, we utilized a bioinformatics analysis of global gene expression as a starting point. Previously, the average half-life (h) and translation rate constant [protein copy number/(mRNA\u00d7h)] of 4248 mRNAs and corresponding proteins were quantified in mammalian cells 19 . According to their data, we calculated the translation capacity per mRNA molecule using the following equation: average half-life (h) \u00d7 translation rate constant [protein copy number/(mRNA\u00d7h)] \u00d7 protein length (amino acids) = translation capacity per mRNA molecule (total amino acids/mRNA) (Supplementary Table 1 ). These results indicated the number of amino acids produced by a single mRNA during its half-life. The mRNA from the murine Rps27a gene was found to possess the highest translation capacity per mRNA molecule. Rps27a is a housekeeping gene that encodes one of the components of the ribosome 40S subunit 20 . Two proteincoding transcripts exist for the murine Rps27a gene (named S27a-44 and S27a-45). These two transcripts have different 5' UTRs and share the same 3' UTR (Supplementary Table  2 and Supplementary Table 3 ). Therefore, we generated two mRNAs utilizing S27a-45 and S27a-44 5' UTRs, respectively. In these two 5' UTRs, we found putative terminal oligo-pyrimidine (TOP) motifs consisting of 4-15 clustered pyrimidines (C and U), which were reported to negatively regulate mRNA translation (Supplementary Table 2) 21 . Subsequently, we removed the TOP motifs from S27a-44 and S27a-45 5' UTRs and constructed two additional 5' UTRs: S27a-44' and S27a-45'. The mRNAs encoding Firefly luciferase were synthesized with these 5' UTRs and were delivered to Hep3B and 293T cells using lipofectamine 3000. The control UTRs include CYBA UTRs (named CYBA) 12 , alpha globin UTRs (named AG) 13 , and modified alpha globin UTRs (AG+G with a complete Kozak sequence and 5AG+G without 3' UTR) 18 . 5' UTR from S27a-44 was better than that from S27a-45 (Fig. 2a) . Removal of the putative TOP motif from S27a-45 moderately improved expression, while S27a-44' without the TOP motif increased the relative luciferase activity over 70% compared to the S27a-44 in the two cell lines. S27a-44' was comparable to CYBA and AG+G, the two best controls (Fig. 2a) .",

Additionally, replacing S27a 3'UTR with another unstructured 3' UTR of the same length significantly decreased protein expression (Supplementary Table  3 and Supplementary Fig. 1 ).

During the process of de novo design for UTRs, several general principles can be considered. For example, the Kozak sequence (GCCACC) located directly upstream of the translation start codon (AUG) can be included because it is a conserved sequence among many mammalian mRNAs for accurate start codon recognition 25 . Second, AUG within 5' UTR is excluded to avoid alternative translation initiation and mutation of the amino acid sequence 10 . Third, secondary structures may be minimized to reduce the energy barriers for smooth scanning of the translation initiation complex along the 5' UTR 13, 26 . Based on the knowledge in the literature, we designed 5' UTR of different length: 10nt, 30, 50nt, 70nt, and 90nt with minimal secondary structures as modeled by RNAfold, a wellestablished computational tool for the prediction of RNA secondary structures ( Supplementary Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2 ). We then prepared the mRNAs and evaluated their luciferase expression as mentioned above. The results showed that relative luciferase activity increased with 5' UTR length and peaked at 70nt (Fig. 3a) . Further increase of the length lowered luciferase expression. Therefore, 70nt was used as the optimal length for the subsequent design of 5'UTRs.",

Generally, high GC content is commonly associated with increased structural complexity 27 . G can base pair with both C and U and induce the formation of more secondary structures 27 . The increase of U content may introduce additional chemically modified nucleotides into 5' UTR if modified U, such as pseudouridine are used in mRNA synthesis. To understand the effects of nucleotide compositions, we performed nucleotide compositions analysis and designed a series of 5' UTRs (NCA-1 to NCA-8). When adjusting nucleotide composition, the minimal numbers of G and C are 3 and 4, respectively, due to the transcription start site determined by the T7 promoter sequence (GG) and the use of Kozak sequence (GCCACC). These 5' UTRs were also built to avoid secondary structures (Supplementary Fig. 2b) , thereby minimizing the impact of structures on translation initiation. As shown in Fig. 3b , a decrease of relative luciferase activity was observed with less A and more G when the amount of C and U were constant (NCA-1 vs NCA-2; NCA-1 vs NCA-3). When G and U were minimal, the increase of C and decrease of A content showed a moderate decrease of luciferase expression (NCA-3 vs NCA-4). When holding G content to the minimal of 3, the inclusion of U boosted relative luciferase activity (NCA-5 vs NCA-6 vs NCA-7 vs NCA-8). Moreover, these 5' UTR with ACU outperformed those consisting of mostly AC and AG, suggesting the importance of U on 5' UTR. Consequently, two constructs with high U contents, NCA-7 and NCA-8, were selected for further studies.",

Previous studies reported that abundant cis-regulatory elements existed in mRNA 3' UTR to modulate protein expression, such as functional motifs for RNA binding proteins (RBPs) 11 . Specific RBPs are able to bind to their cognate motifs within mRNA 3' UTR and enhance protein expression through various mechanisms 30 . One of the RBPs, QKI-7, was shown to enable cytoplasmic polyadenylation of mRNA and upregulation of protein expression after binding to its target motif called QKI Response Element (QRE) in 3' UTR 31 . Two QRE sequences were obtained from previous reports, namely QRE1 32 and QRE2 33 . Another RBP, HuR, was believed to stabilize target transcripts by binding to its cognate motifs called AU-Rich Element (ARE) in eukaryotic cells 34 . One such ARE sequence was obtained from human eIF4E mRNA 3' UTR 34 . Besides eukaryotic mRNA, the sindbis virus (SinV) evolved to utilize part of its viral 3' UTR to recruit HuR and induce potent stabilization of the viral RNA genome 35 . The SinV RNA regions responsible for HuR binding, including repeated sequence element 3 and U-rich element (together named R3U) was obtained. Additionally, the ribosome binding fragments from two internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 36 and foot-andmouth disease virus (FMDV) 37 were selected. These two fragments possess high binding affinities to ribosomal subunits and have the potential to retain and recycle the subunits for more efficient translation re-initiation. Based on these literature findings, we prepared mRNA transcripts with the integration of the following elements after S27a 3' UTR: QRE1, QRE2, R3U, ARE, EMCV, and FMDV (Supplementary Table 3 ). R3U was identified as a preferred functional motif from the results in both Hep3B and 293T cells (Fig. 4a) . Through the comprehensive UTR engineering, the optimal UTRs was identified as NCA-7d as the 5' UTR and S27a plus a functional motif R3U as the 3' UTR (named as NASAR). After several rounds of design and validation of UTRs, we then compared NASAR with S27a-45, the starting point of endogenous gene together with two additional control UTRs (MOD1 and MOD2) in the literature 16, 17 . NASAR was over 10-fold more potent than S27a-45, 4 to 7-fold better than CYBA or AG+G, and up to 2-fold superior to MOD1 and MOD2 in cell lines and primary cells ( Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 3) . These results demonstrate that our concept, integration of endogenous UTRs with further de novo design, is an efficient strategy for UTRs design. Relative luciferase activity was normalized to that of S27a-45. All data are presented as the mean \u00b1 s.d. (n=4).

According to previous studies on SARS-CoV, its structural spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, regarded as the dominant antigens eliciting neutralizing antibodies in SARS-CoV patients, were explored as vaccine candidates 38, 39 . The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein responsible for viral entry was also utilized for vaccine development 38 . The membrane (M) protein contained epitopes 40 . Additionally, the envelope (E) protein interacting with M was indispensable for the assembly of viral particles 41 . Therefore, five NASAR mRNAs were prepared to express RBD, S, N, M, and E proteins as the vaccine candidates. Since no antibodies have been developed against these five potential antigens in SARS-CoV-2, we installed a FLAG tag to RBD andS protein , and a VSV-G tag to N, M, and E proteins in order to detect their expression. To confirm the effects of UTRs on antigen expression using NASAR mRNA vaccine, three additional mRNAs were synthesized using the coding sequence of RBD with control UTRs, CYBA, MOD2, and NASAR. After the delivery of these three mRNAs into 293T cells using our previously developed lipid like-nanoparticles, TT3 42 , RBD expression was analyzed by an ELISA. NASAR enabled antigen expression 3-fold of CYBA and 1.6-fold of MOD2 (Fig. 5a) , consistent with the luciferase expression results in Fig. 4c . Then, NASAR mRNAs encoding all five SARS-CoV-2 antigens were delivered to 293T cells by TT3 separately. We observed the obvious expression of these antigens through immunostaining (Fig. 5b,  Supplementary Fig. 4) .",

Regarding the 5' UTR, the length is critical and the optimal sequences tested in this work do not exceed 70nt. And it should be free of certain regulatory elements, e.g. TOP motifs, secondary structure, upstream open reading frame, and microRNA binding site. (2) . In terms of 3' UTR, secondary structures may benefit protein production. A plausible explanation is that such structure in 3' UTR might prevent ribosome from skipping the stop codon and reaching mRNA 3' end that triggers Non-Stop mRNA Decay (NSD) 46 . Long 3' UTR length does not necessarily provide additional translation benefits. Long 3' UTR typically contains a mixture of positive and negative cis-regulatory elements 11 . Although it is challenging to obtain a long endogenous 3' UTR with only positive elements, specific positive cis-regulatory motifs in 3' UTRs may be used to improve mRNA translation. R3U, a HuR binding motif added to 3' UTR, enhanced protein expression, consistent with the observation in their natural context 34, 35 . This indicates that certain positive cis-regulatory elements may be used as an important UTR component. author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

The microRNA binding sites within 5' UTR were predicted using the custom prediction tool in the microRNA database (miRDB) (http://mirdb.org/) 48 . Due to the minimum size limit of 100nt for mRNA target submission, the full 5' UTR and first 100 nucleotides of the firefly luciferase coding region were used as the input sequences.",

The transformed E. coli was allowed to grow on LB broth (Miller) plate with agar and 100ug/mL carbenicillin (Teknova). Individual colonies were inoculated and outgrown in LB broth liquid medium (Miller) containing 100ug/mL carbenicillin overnight with vigorous shaking at 250 rpm. Plasmids were extracted using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). Concentration was measured on a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo). The region of interest in the plasmid from the T7 promoter to 3' UTR was confirmed by Sanger Sequencing. mRNA synthesis All mRNA transcripts were synthesized by in vitro transcription using a protocol modified from our previous publication 49 . Briefly, DNA templates were synthesized by PCR amplification of the corresponding plasmids using a forward primer and a reverse primer containing 120T at 5' end. The DNA templates were purified by QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. All mRNAs were synthesized by in vitro transcription with 100% substitution of UTP by pseudouridine-5'triphosphate (TriLink) using AmpliScribe T7-Flash Transcription Kit (Lucigen) following the manufacturer's instruction and purified by RNA Clean & Concentrator (Zymo). The capping of mRNA was conducted using Vaccinia Capping System (NEB) and Cap 2\u00b4-O-Methyltransferase (NEB), followed by another purification by RNA Clean & Concentrator (Zymo).
