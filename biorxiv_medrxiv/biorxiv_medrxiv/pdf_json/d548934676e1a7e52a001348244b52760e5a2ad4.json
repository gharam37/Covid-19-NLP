The main protease (M pro ) of COVID-28 19 virus is a key enzyme, which plays an essential role in viral replication and 29 transcription, making it an ideal drug target. An FDA-approved antineoplastic drug, 30 carmofur, has been identified as an inhibitor that targets COVID-19 virus M pro .",

The crystal structure 33 shows that carmofur contains an electrophilic carbonyl reactive group, which 34 covalently binds to C145, a member of the catalytic dyad. As a result, its fatty acid tail 35 occupies the hydrophobic S2 subsite of M pro whilst its 5-fluorouracil head is cleaved as 36 product of the new covalent bond that has formed. Carmofur is active in a cell based 37 antiviral assay with an EC50 of 24.87 \u03bcM. It is therefore a promising lead compound 38 for the development of new antivirals to target COVID-19.",

The number of 46 confirmed cases worldwide continues to grow at a rapid rate and is far from peaking. 47 However, there are no specific drugs or vaccines available to control symptoms or the 48 spread of this disease. 49 The COVID-19 virus has a ~30,000 nt RNA genome encoded with two translation 50 products, polyproteins 1a and 1ab (pp1a and pp1ab) which are crucial for replication 51 and transcription 1,2 . These polyproteins become matured non-structural and structural 52 proteins through auto-cleavage by the main protease (M pro ) and by a papain-like 53 protease 3 . Because of this, M pro is an excellent target for anti-coronavirus (CoV) drug 54 development 4-6 . In order to rapidly discover new drug leads that target COVID-19 virus 55 M pro , our group screened over 10,000 compounds from a library that consisted of 56 approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other pharmacologically active 57 compounds. Amongst these we identified carmofur as compound that can inhibit M pro 58 with an IC50 of 1.82 \u03bcM 7 . 59 Carmofur is an FDA-approved antineoplastic drug, and a derivative of 5-60 fluorouracil (5-FU) a widely drug used against solid cancers. 5-FU is especially 61 efficient for controlling head, neck, and gastrointestinal tumors 8 . Carmofur ( Figure 1A) 62 is a derivative of this compound and has been used in colon cancer therapy since 1981 9 . 63 Clinical research has also shown that carmofur has a curative effect on breast, gastric, 64 bladder, and colorectal cancers 10-12 . The target for carmofur is believed to be 65 thymidylate synthase an enzyme that converts deoxy uridine monophosphate (dUMP) 66 to deoxythymidine monophosphate 13,14 . Carmofur has also been shown to target human 67 acid ceramidase (AC) 15 , a potential drug target for the treatment of melanoma and 68 glioblastoma tumors 16,17 . Carmofur inhibits human AC through the covalent 69 modification of its catalytic cysteine 18 . Our previous data shows that carmofur inhibits 70 M pro activity 7 , but the molecular details as to how it inhibits this target are unresolved.",

It 141 indicates that carmofur have a larger EC50 value than that for Ebselen (EC50=4.67 \u03bcM). 142 We then set out to determine the accurate EC50 value for carmofur.
