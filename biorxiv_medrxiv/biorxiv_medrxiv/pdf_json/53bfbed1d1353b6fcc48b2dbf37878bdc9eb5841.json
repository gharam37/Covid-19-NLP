Vehicle or remdesivir were given by intraperitoneal injection or renal injection through the left ureter in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice. Serum and kidneys were harvested. The concentrations of remdesivir and GS-441524 were measured using LC-MS/MS. Renal and liver function were assessed. Renal fibrosis was evaluated by Masson's trichrome staining and Western blotting. Results: Remdesivir and GS-441524 inhibited cell proliferation and the expression of fibrotic markers (fibronectin, pSmad3, and aSMA) in NRK-49F and HK2 cells.",

Novel coronavirus pneumonia is becoming a worldwide public health event due to the rapid increase in new cases and the high severity and mortality (1) (2) (3) . A latest research shows that COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit were older (median age 66 vs 51) and more likely to have comorbidities (72.2% vs 37.3%) than patients not in the intensive care unit, suggesting that elderly people or patients with underlying disease have higher disease severity (3). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common disorder and the prevalence of CKD is around 10% in adults (4, 5). Thus, CKD patients combined with COVID-19 should be drawn enough attention from nephrologists.",

There was no dead cells and cell morphology was normal at the highest concentration (100 \u03bc M) of GS-441524 when observed by microscopy. The protein expression of fibronectin (FN), phosphorylation of Smad3 (pSmad3), and alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) were assessed by Western blotting as markers for fibrosis. TGF-\u03b2 stimulation increased the expression of FN, pSmad3 and \u03b1 -SMA in NRK-49F cells, and dose-dependent inhibition of these fibrotic markers was observed starting from 10 \u03bc M of GS-441524 (Figure1B). The effect of GS-441524 on renal fibrosis was further studied in renal epithelial cells (HK2). 48 hours stimulation with 2.5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 increased the cell proliferation of HK cells as shown by CCK8 assay, and inhibition of cell proliferation was observed at 100 \u03bc M of GS-441524 (Figure 1C). Remarkable inhibition of FN, pSmad3, and \u03b1 -SMA expression by GS-44152 was observed starting from 10 \u03bc M of GS-441524 (",

Mice were treated with vehicle or 10 mg/kg remdesivir daily by i.p. injection. Mice were sacrificed at day 10 at 1 hour after last injection. Serum and kidney tissue were collected. For the experiment of 1 hour or 7 days treatment by intrarenal injection, mice were randomly divided into two groups: (I) UUO + vehicle (n=11), and (II) UUO + remdesivir (n=11) group. Four mice from each group were sacrificed at 1 hour after renal injection, and the rest of mice were sacrificed at day7. Serum and kidney tissue were collected.
