With a mortality originally posted by WHO at 3-4% 1 rising to over 10% in some nations 2 , and ventilator shortages reported in Italy 3 and USA 4, 5 there is considerable cause for concern. Importantly whilst senior NIH authorities have since revised mortality estimates in the general population downward to below one percent 6 mortality rates in the elderly and patients with chronic disease are likely to remain appreciable [6] [7] [8] [9] .

A large literature describes the immunosuppressive properties of several cannabinoids including \u03949tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol and cannabinol [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Cannabis users frequently inhale with deep breaths which are held for long period so that smoke can penetrate deeply into the lung 12, 21 . Moreover cannabis has been shown to be contaminated with foreign chemicals, viruses and fungal spores 22-25 so that concern has been expressed that patients can be relatively immunocompromised and at heightened risk of exposure to microorganisms placing them at increased risk of infection 26 .",

When the effect was studied in a multivariable geospatial model after controlling for international travel, ethnicity, income, population, population density and drug use interactive terms in last month cannabis were significant from 7.3x10 -15 and daily cannabis use from 7.3x10 -11 . Cannabis use was independently predictive of CVIR in the final spgm model. These results strongly support the hypothesis of an ecological geospatial link between cannabis use and coronavirus infection rate.",

This is an important issue requiring further research. This report has several strengths and limitations. Our study is timely, and uses a current dataset for CVIR. The study uses a well validated nationally representative drug use dataset, which is widely studied and extensively quoted. Importantly we use two metrics of cannabis use including one which provides a measure of daily (or near daily) cannabis use, which has been shown to be the major parameter of American cannabis consumption 27 . We use a very large dataset of international flight arrivals into USA which captures the whole population of these events over a 12 month period.

A strong quintile effect was noted along with a prominent effect of cannabis decriminalization. After adjustment cannabis use emerged as a persistent, independent and robust correlate of CVIR at high levels of significance. This finding is of concern and suggests a powerful negative feedforward interaction between two major public health challenges faced by USA and the international community. Given the immediate salience and potent imminence of the coronavirus epidemic this association is well worth further immediate epidemiological research. The present report indicates stricter cannabis controls as one public health measure by which to address an infectious challenge and support cellular and soluble immunity for the whole community. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60 .

Eight drug codes were employed namely: IRABUPOSPNR for prescription pain reliever abuse in past year, PNRNMYR for Recoded -pain relievers past year misuse, MRJMDAYS for percent using cannabis on all or most days (defined as \u226420 days per month), MJRMON for past month cannabis use, COCYR for past year cocaine use, CIGMON for past month cigarette use, BNGALC for binge alcohol use in past month and AMPHETAPYU for any amphetamine past year use.
