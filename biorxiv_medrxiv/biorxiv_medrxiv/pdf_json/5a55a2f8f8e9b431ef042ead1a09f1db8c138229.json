Furthermore, requirement and use of a nasal catheter or oxygen mask was significantly lower in COVID-19 infected patients with mycoplasma lgG positivity (p=0.029), suggesting a better prognosis.

Of particular note, the immune response rendered against the virus was noted to be stronger in the IgG positive group, evident through an overall higher leukocyte count. This can partially be explained by reprogrammed immune cells. 4 Prior evidence has supported that when the lungs recover from infection they develop new alveolar macrophage biology, which can protect the lungs of adults against pneumonia. 5 Our retrospective patient review highlighted a similar phenomenon: COVID-19 patients with IgG positivity displayed milder symptoms and rarely experienced severe disease (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.89-3.02). To eliminate the interference of age, we compared the outcomes of elder patients (> 60 years) and Normal ranges for the laboratory values are as follows: white blood-cell count, 3.5-9.5x10 9 /L; hemoglobin, ",

COVID-19 was diagnosed in accordance with the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program, 7th edition, published by the National Health Commission of China. Clinical symptoms, medical records as well as laboratory tests were reviewed. Continuous variables were described as mean, median, and interquartile range (IQR), while categorical variables were compared by X 2 test or Fisher's exact test between COVID-19 infected patients with mycoplasma lgG (-) and mycoplasma lgG (+). Data were expressed using frequency rates and percentages. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to establish whether continuous variables were normally distributed. Then independent group t test was used if normally distributed, otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was used. A two-sided \u03b1 of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. SPSS version 23.0 was used for all statistical analyses. This retrospective study was approved by The Institutional Review Board at Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Results A total of 133 patients with COVID-19 were identified, of which 38 displayed Mycoplasma IgG positivity. Comparison of COVID-19 patients with mycoplasma lgG positivity against those without mycoplasma IgG, showed no differences in the demographics (age, p=.105; female sex, p=.375) or common signs and symptoms of the patients (fever, p=0.23; cough, p=0.53; fatigue, p=1.000; dyspnea, p=0.67; diarrhea, p=0.39; Table 1). Statistically significant differences were, however, shown in terms of laboratory test results.
