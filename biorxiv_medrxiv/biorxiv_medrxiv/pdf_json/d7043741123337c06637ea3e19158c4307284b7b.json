In the meantime, public health officials must rely on other interventions, such as social distancing and travel restrictions, to slow the spread and reduce the peak of the outbreak, in order to prevent health systems from being overwhelmed. 4, 5 In January 2020, as the epidemic in Wuhan grew, many countries implemented travel bans, and airlines canceled flights to attempt to slow the spread. 6 A number of studies have estimated the risk of importation globally, with some suggesting up to two-thirds of all imported cases went undetected. 7, 8 For Taiwan, there have been 267 reported cases as of March 27, 2020 9 , with 227 imported (85%) and 40 local cases (15%). 37 local cases (92.5 %) were linked to imported or known cases, and 3 local cases (7.5 %) have unknown origin.",

Travel reductions started from the beginning of the simulations or when there were 10, 20, 30, 50, or 100 accumulated infections. The proportion of reduction is denoted by G.

We then examined the level to which travel restrictions could reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Taiwan at the initial stage of an outbreak. In both the contact model and the residence model, decreasing intracity movement had a much larger impact on P1000,3 ( Figure 1 ) and T1000,3 ( Figure  S3 ) than decreasing intercity movement.

Intracity travel reduction reduced the total number of infections and delayed time to peak in both the contact and residence models ( Figure 5 and Figure S10 ), while intercity travel reduction had only minimal impact on the overall dynamics in both models. Similarly, increased intercity and intracity colocation probabilities during the Lunar New Year ( Figure S6B ) led to increased total number of infections and decreased time to peak in the contact model, but increasing only intercity movements during Lunar New Year in the residence model only shortened time to the peak minimally ( Figure 5 and Figure S10 ), suggesting reducing large gatherings during holiday times is more important than reducing intercity travel.",

We identified the top cities with the highest risk of infection as well as the top cities with the highest importation risk from other cities based on Facebook data and population sizes. We made a web-based interface showing the geographic distribution of infections at different time points (T100, T500 and T1000) in the initial stages of the outbreak given different locations of initial infections. This will help the public avoid high-risk areas, help public health professionals identify surveillance targets, and inform decisions on travel restrictions. Consistent with previous findings showing that international travel bans are less effective than social distancing within the country, 6, 19 we found that intracity travel reduction has a higher impact on disease dynamics than intercity travel reduction and increasing the length of intracity travel reduction increases the impact. Intercity travel reduction, however, influences the variation in infection numbers across cities and can reduce the number of cities that have infections at the initial stage of the outbreak. While intercity travel did not decrease the probability of having high numbers of infections, containing the infections to a few cities has important public health impacts, as this means surveillance system can focus on fewer cities and control efforts can be more targeted.",

The effectiveness of travel reductions varied depending on how early into the outbreak they started and their duration; for example, if restrictions lasted at least three months, starting them as early as possible had the greatest impact on P1000,3, but if limited to only one month, starting them later sometimes had more of an impact and sometimes did not, depending on the context. Health officials can therefore take into consideration feasibility of different interventions, impact on society, and the capacity of the healthcare system to determine the optimal interventions and their duration. 5 We found that the volume of intercity travel around Lunar New Year, where both intercity movements and intracity colocation rates increased, can significantly increase the speed of virus spread. Another traditional holiday, Ching Ming festival, is coming soon (April 2 to 5), and the volume of human movement between cities during this period is expected to increase like Lunar New Year, but at a lower level. Our results suggest that it is important to avoid travel or reduce the impact of travel through measures such as limiting social interactions and wearing facemasks when taking public transportation to reduce the spread of the virus.",

Travelers go back to their home location at probability # per unit of time. Mij,t,t+1 represents the number of people moving from location i to location j between time t and t+1. For simplicity, we assumed that the majority of travel is work-related travel and on average travelers spend eight hours in the travel destination ( # =1 given the unit of time is 8 hours) and that Tij is proportional to Mij, leaving Fi the only parameters to be fitted. We used a gradient descent algorithm to find the local optimum solution for Fi, where the cost function is defined by the sum of the squared difference between normalized mij and the normalized value of Mij from the model.
