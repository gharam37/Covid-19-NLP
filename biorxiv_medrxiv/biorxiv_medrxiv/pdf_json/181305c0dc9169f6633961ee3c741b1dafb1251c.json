Although two 29 vaccines are available, the vaccination coverage of the equine population is largely insufficient to 30 prevent new EAV outbreaks around the world. In this study, we present a high-throughput in vitro 31 assay suitable for testing candidate antiviral molecules on equine dermal cells infected by EAV. Using 32 this assay, we identified three molecules that impair EAV infection in equine cells: the broad-spectrum 33 antiviral and nucleoside analog ribavirin, and two compounds previously described as inhibitors of 34 dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), the fourth enzyme of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. 35 These molecules effectively suppressed cytopathic effects associated to EAV infection, and strongly 36 inhibited viral replication and production of infectious particles.

This is supported 86 by a recent study showing that a global strategy based on vaccination combined with drug therapies 87 enhances protection against foot-and-mouth disease 10 . In our study, we have developed a high-88 throughput cell-viability assay based on infected equine dermal cells. Then, we took advantage of this 89 new assay to explore the potential of broad-spectrum antivirals ( replication through multiple direct and indirect mechanisms. In particular, ribavirin inhibits inosine 5'-103 monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), a key enzyme catalyzing the first committed and rate-104 limiting step in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. As such, IMPDH inhibition interferes with 105 the production of GTP that is necessary for the synthesis of viral RNA molecules 22 , but other 106 mechanisms have been reported such as the direct inhibition of viral polymerases or the lethal 107 mutagenesis of viral genomes 23,24 . Besides ribavirin, we also tested two newly designed BSA that 108 target the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, namely GAC50 and IPPA17-A04. These two molecules 109 are inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), the fourth and rate-limiting enzyme of the 110 de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, and were shown to impair the replication of many different 111 positive-strand and negative-strand RNA viruses [25] [26] [27] . In this study, we have shown, for the first time, 112 that both ribavirin and pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors inhibit EAV in equine dermal cell cultures. 113 114 115 author/funder.

As a cellular model, we selected the ED cell line that 120 originates from equine dermis and thus matches the host specificity of EAV. To setup our in vitro 121 assay, we first analyzed the proliferation of non-infected ED cells in 96-well plates. To determine the 122 number of viable cells in each culture well, we quantified ATP which parallels the number of 123 metabolically active, living cells. Assays were performed using a commercial reagent based on the 124 principle that firefly luciferase luminescence is proportional and dependent on ATP concentrations 125 (CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay; Promega). In non-infected cells, ATP levels increased 126 by 41% in the first 24 h as a consequence of cellular proliferation, but then plateaued at 48 h as cell 127 cultures reached confluence ( Figure 1A ). Same experiment was performed using cell cultures infected 128 with the Bucyrus strain of EAV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. As shown in Figure 1A as the number of genome copies increased by more than 2 logs in the first 24 h, and by 3 logs at 48 h 136 post-infection ( Figure 1B ). Finally, we showed that infectious viral particles are also produced by ED 137 cells. Indeed, at least 1x10 5 PFU/ml were detected in supernatants of infected cultures 48 h.p.i. 138 ( Figure 1C ). Therefore, ED cells represent an excellent in vitro model for EAV infection, and 139 quantification of ATP levels in culture wells is a convenient way to measure cytopathic effects 140 associated to viral growth. 141 142",

We thus tested the antiviral effects of ribarivin on EAV using the cell-viability assay 146 described above. As a prerequisite, we first evaluated the cytotoxicity of ribavirin on ED cells.

No significant cell death was reported at 10 \u00b5g/ml or lower concentrations of ribavirin when 150 compared to the initial number viable cells seeded in the culture wells ( Figure 2A ).

Using 164 our in vitro EAV infection assay, we tested first the cytotoxicity of both compounds. IPPA17-A04 and 165 GAC-50 treatment did not show any sign of cytotoxicity on ED cells. At 100 \u00b5g/ml, cell viability was 166 above 80% after 48h of treatment, but cytostatic effects were observed as expected for this class of 167 drug ( Figure 2B and 2C). These results indicate that TC 50 for IPPA17-A04 and GAC-50 is over 100 168 \u00b5g/ml in ED cells. We then explored the cytoprotective effect of these two compounds in EAV-infected 169 cultures at different concentrations. Our results showed that after 48 h of culture, the viability of 170 infected ED cells reached 79% when treated with 1 \u00b5g/ml of IPPA17-A04, and was above 80% when 171 treated with concentrations >5 \u00b5g/ml ( Figure 3B ). The IC 50 of IPPA17-A04 was estimated at 0.70 172 \u00b5g/ml, i.e. 1.74 \u00b5M. GAC50 is not as effective since viability of ED infected cells treated with GAC50 is 173 >80% only at the highest concentrations of 20 or 50 \u00b5g/ml ( Figure 3C ) with an IC 50 at 7.2 \u00b5g/ml, i.e. 174 author/funder.

            "text": ". Indeed, RNA viral infections are a substantial public health 58 burden affecting humans and domestic animals 2 . The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is the 59 latest and most striking example with thousands of deaths reported so far in different countries in 60 Europe, Asia and Middle East. Horses are not an exception, and five of seven equine viruses listed by 61 the World Organization for Animal Health are RNA viruses (OIE). Unfortunately, the veterinary 62 therapeutic arsenal to fight against equine viral diseases is limited, or even not-existent as no antiviral 63 molecule is listed today. During the last years, several studies have used high-throughput screening 64 (HTS) techniques to scan small compound libraries that could impair the replication of equine viruses. 65 These studies were mostly focused on zoonotic viruses like West-Nile virus 3,4 . Non-zoonotic equine 66 RNA viruses, such as equine arteritis virus (EAV), were not included in those screenings. Equine 67 arteritis virus (EAV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, member of the subfamily 68 Equarterivirinae, member of the family Arteriviridae, genus Alphaarterivirus from order Nidovirales like 69 the Coronaviridae. Equine viral arteritis disease is a recurrent viral infection that causes important 70 economic losses to the horse industry. In most of the cases, EAV infection is subclinical, but some 71 viral strains are virulent and induce fever with body temperature going up to 41 \u00b0C, depression, 72 anorexia, edema, nasal discharge, and conjunctivitis. EAV is a virus transmitted by respiratory or 73 venereal routes. After EAV primary infection, up to 70% of stallions may become persistently infected 74 and shed the virus in their semen. Those stallions, also called shedder stallions, are a key component 75 in EAV epidemiology and transmission of the disease 5,6 . Moreover, infected pregnant mares could 76 abort or stillbirth a weak foal. Besides, foal infection can cause fulminating pneumonia with a lethal 77 outcome. The loss of these animals, together with the restrictive reproductive activity of infected 78 stallions, are significant complications for the equine industry 7 . 79",

We also confirm that 133 observed cytopathic effects reflect EAV replication by quantifying the number of viral genome copies 134 at 1, 24 h and 48 h post-infection using RT-qPCR.

Cells were cultured in absence or presence of the compounds at 192 different concentrations for 48 h. Supernatants were collected and viral titers determined onRK13  193    cells. Ribavirin treatment reduced viral titers (expressed as pfu/ml) by almost 6 logs at 5 \u00b5g/ml, and 194 more than 8 logs at 10 \u00b5g/ml (Figure 5A). These results demonstrate that ribavirin sharply reduces the 195 number of viral particles produced by infected ED cells, and thus the viral dissemination to proximal 196 cells. On the other side, IPPA17-A04 and GAC50 showed the same antiviral activity when used at 50 197 \u00b5g/ml with a reduction of viral titers of 7 and 8 logs, respectively (Figure 5Band 5C) whereas cytotoxic 198 effects on ED cells were not significant (Figure 2B and 2C).

            "text": "Uridine reverses the antiviral action of IPPA17-A04 211IPPA17-A04 is known to inhibit DHODH, a key enzyme involved in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. 212To demonstrate that IPPA17-A04 prevents EAV replication through the inhibition of de novo pyrimidine 213 biosynthesis, culture medium of infected ED cells was supplemented with uridine. Indeed, uridine 214 absorption from the microenvironment can efficiently replenish the intracellular pool of pyrimidines 215 when de novo biosynthesis is impaired. Addition of uridine at 30 \u00b5g/ml in the culture medium of EAV-216 infected ED cells abolished the cytoprotective effect of IPPA17-A04 (Figure 6A) and restored viral 217 replication (Figure 6B). These results indicate that the antiviral activity of IPPA17-A04 in ED cells 218 relies on the inhibition of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway and depletion of the pool unknown when the next EAV outbreak will occur, but since 1953, when the EAV was 223 isolated for the first time, EAV has regularly reemerged around the world. We think that antiviral 224 therapy used in conjunction with vaccination can reduce the viral load of infected animals, thus 225 significantly decreasing the risk of viral dissemination in the vicinity of stables. This should also reduce 226 the risk of animal losses due to opportunistic infections such as fulminating pneumonia in young foals.227 Only a recent study, exploring the inhibition of nidoviruses by the broad-spectrum antiviral molecule 228 K22 in infected hamster cells (BHK-21), reported the first evidence of EAV inhibition by a synthetic 229 molecule 29 . The identification of BSA was until now impeded by the lack of suitable assay for 230 monitoring EAV growth in high-throughput settings. To address this need, we have developed a 231 relevant EAV infection model that is based on equine cells and was optimized for the screening of 232 compound libraries. The infection model developed is based on the infection of the ED cell line which 233",

            "text": "A04 was the least toxic for ED cells and the most efficient to block EAV replication as well as 241 the production of infectious viral particles (SI>140). Addition of pyrimidine to the culture medium of 242 EAV-infected equine cells reverted the antiviral activity of IPPA17-A04. This demonstrates that as 243 expected for this well-characterized DHODH inhibitor, the anti-EAV effect critically depends on the 244 inhibition of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway by this molecule. The IC 50 of IPPA17-A04 245 was 1.74 \u00b5M against EAV in ED cells. Quite surprisingly, this is much higher than IC 50 values 246 previously reported for the inhibition of measles virus (MV; IC 50 = 2.7 nM) or human respiratory 247 syncytial virus (hRSV; IC 50 = 5 nM) in human cell lines27  . This could be explained by the lower 248 sensitivity of EAV to DHODH inhibitors. However, our data show that GAC50, another inhibitor of de 249 novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, impaired EAV replication with an IC 50 of 30.2 \u00b5M, very close to hRSV in 250 human cells (IC50 = 25 \u03bcM; 27 ). This suggests EAV is not particularly resistant to DHODH inhibitors 251 compared to hRSV. One hypothesis to explain the lower antiviral activity of IPPA17-A04 in equine 252 cells compared to human cells, one hypothesis is that IPPA17-A04 is less fit to equine DHODH. 253Indeed, despite high levels of DHODH conservation amongst mammals, and in particular between 254 human and horse (92% of amino acid identity), host specific effects were previously reported for small 255 molecules targeting this enzyme 31 . For example, GAC50 but also Compound 1 described by Dong-256 Hoon Chung et al and brequinar, three unrelated DHODH inhibitor, were all shown to be active in 257 human but not in rodent cells 3,27,32 . This host specific profile could explain that IPPA17-A04 is more 258 active in human cells, and well illustrates the interest of screening molecules against EAV in a culture 259 model based on cells from equine origin. Although IPPA17-A04 already has the highest selectivity 260 index compared to GAC50 or ribavirin, our results suggest that it could be further optimized to better fit 261 the structure of equine DHODH and inhibit this enzyme at lower concentrations. 262 HTS pipelines are essential to screen large chemical libraries and/or evaluate multiple drug 263 combinations.

Our results demonstrate that this antiviral activity extends toArteriviridae,  276    suggesting that pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors may act as pan-nidovirales inhibitors.

ED cells were infected with EAV at a 310 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. Infected ED and mock-infected ED cells were seeded in 96-well 311 plates (Greiner Bio-one) at 2.5.10 4 cells per well in 100 \u00b5l of supplemented DMEM and incubated for 312 1, 24, and 48 h.

BSA are 90 small molecules that, because of their peculiar mode of action, impair the replication of multiple 91 viruses from different species and genotypes. Nucleotide and nucleoside analogs are excellent 92 examples of BSA. They inhibit transcription and/or replication of different RNA and DNA viruses by 93 targeting components of the viral replication machinery. However, it is established that numerous 94 viruses eventually mutate and develop resistance to these molecules 11-13 . To circumvent this 95 limitation, newly designed BSA overtake the drug resistance problem by targeting host cellular 96 pathways hijacked by the virus to replicate instead of viral factors themselves. 97 Interestingly, one of the most studied BSA is ribavirin which has been described as an inhibitor of 98 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus 99 (PEDV) 14 , two nidoviruses closely related to EAV.
