COVID-19 forecasts have played an important role in capturing the probability of infection and the basic reproduction rate. In this study, we predicted some trajectories of trajectories associated with COVID-19 in the coming days in India using an Autoregression integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and Richard's model. By the end of April 2020, the incidence of new cases is predicted to be 5200 (95% CI: 4650 to 6002) through the ARIMA model versus be 6378 (95% CI: 4904 to 7851) Richard model. We estimated that there would be a total of 197 (95% CI: 118 to 277) deaths and drop down in the recovery rates will reach around 501 (95% CI: 245 to 758) by the end of April 2020. These estimates can help to strengthen the implementation of strategies to increase the health system capacity and enactment of social distancing measures all over India.",

Nonlinear models/functions are more advanced methods that provide solution iteratively [6] . The iterative methods such as nonlinear regression include the modified Gauss-Newton method, gradient or steepest-descent method, multivariate secant or false position, and the Marquardt method [6, 7] . With regards to COVID-19, forecasts have played an important role in capturing the probability of infection and the basic reproduction rate. No studies have used a specific nonlinear model to forecast the COVID-19 dynamics in India. Therefore, we generated 30 days forecast the dynamics of cumulative confirmed death and recovery of COVID-19 cases in India.",

Here susceptible is meant by people exposed to this COVID-19, infected comes after COVID-19 is confirmed in a person and removed means that either the person is recovered or death due to COVID-19. Mathematical it is determined concerning time, i.e.the proportion of susceptible individuals in total population I -the proportion of infected individuals in total population R -the proportion of removed individuals in total population \u03b2 -transmission parameter (rate of infection for susceptible-infected contact) c -number of contacts each host has per unit time (contact rate) is fundamental and has important assumptions.

Second, the population is homogenous (all individuals are the same) and only differ by their disease state.

We estimated that there would be a total of 197 (95% CI: 118 to 277) deaths and drop down in the recovery rates will reach around 501 (95% CI: 245 to 758) by the end of April 2020.
