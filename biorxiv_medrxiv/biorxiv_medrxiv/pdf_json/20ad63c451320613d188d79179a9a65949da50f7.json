SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the +RNA virus family that utilize single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecules as genomes. SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, has an unusually large genome for a +RNA virus that encodes four structural proteinsthe matrix (M), small envelope (E), spike (S) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) -and sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) that together ensure replication of the virus in the host cell. The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N is essential for linking the viral genome to the viral membrane. Its N-terminal RNA binding domain (N-NTD) captures the RNA genome while the Cterminal domain anchors the ribonucleoprotein complex to the viral membrane via its interaction with the M protein.",

The non-structural proteins carry all of the enzymatic activities important for the viral replication, mostly associated with RNA replication. The genome SARS-CoV-2 also encodes an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase complex (nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12), RNA capping machinery (nsp10, nsp13, nsp14 and 16) and additional enzymes such as proteases (the nsp3 PL pro and the nsp5 3CL pro ) which cleave viral polyproteins and/or impede innate immunity (1) . The four structural proteins together with the viral +RNA genome and the envelope constitute the virion. The matrix (M), small envelope (E), and spike (S) proteins are embedded within the lipid envelope. The fourth structural protein, the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), physically links the envelope to the +RNA genome. It consists of an N-terminal (NTD) and a C-terminal (CTD) domain ( Figure 1 ). Both domains are capable of RNA binding. In addition, the CTD serves as a dimerization domain and binds the matrix protein forming the physical link between the+ RNA genome and the envelope. The SARS N protein has also been shown to modulate the host intracellular machinery and plays regulatory roles during the viral life cycle (2) . In light of the genomic similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is reasonable to expect the N protein to function in a similar way.",

The structure revealed an overall right hand-like fold composed of a \u03b2-sheet core with an extended central loop. The core region adopts a five-stranded U-shaped right-handed antiparallel \u03b2-sheet platform with the topology \u03b24-\u03b22-\u03b23-\u03b21-\u03b25 flanked by two short \u03b1-helices (\u03b11 occurs before the \u03b22 strand and \u03b12 after the \u03b24 strand). A prominent feature of the structure is a large protruding loop between \u03b22-\u03b23 that forms a long basic \u03b2-hairpin (\u03b22' and \u03b23') ( Figure 2 ). This long \u03b2-hairpin is reminiscent of a finger and composed mostly of basic amino acids residues, and we therefore refer to it as a basic finger ( Figure 2 ). This basic finger extends from the \u03b2-core structure that we refer to as a palm. Analysis of the electrostatic potential of the N-NTD revealed a highly positively charged cleft between the basic finger and the palm creating a putative RNA binding site in the hinge/junction region between the palm and basic finger. Our NMR analysis is consistent with recent X-ray analysis (PDB IDs: 6M3M and 6VYO). In addition, the NMR structure revealed that the basic finger is highly flexible (Figure 2A ) whereas in the crystal structures it is locked in one place by crystal lattice contacts.",

We performed an NMR-based titration experiment using a short double-stranded RNA (5'-CACUGAC-3' and 5'-GUCAGUG-3'). Basically, we were adding isotopically unlabeled RNA to the 15 N/ 13 C labeled protein and we followed changes in positions of assigned signals in NMR spectra ( Figure 3 ) to reveal the molecular interface of the N-NTD:RNA complex. Overlay of the 2D 15 N/ 1 H HSQC and 2D 13 C/ 1 H HSQC spectra of a free and RNA bound N-NTD revealed residues that were significantly perturbed by RNA binding. All these significantly affected residues (A50, T57, H59, R92, I94, S105, R107, R149, Y172) are located in the basic finger or close to the junction between the basic finger and the palm as expected based on the analysis of the electrostatic potential.

We used the HADDOCK protocol for NMR-restraint driven docking simulations (4) . As a starting conformation of the RNA we chose a short double helix based on the published crystal structure of a short RNA duplex (5) . A detailed analysis of the chemical shift perturbations (CSP) mapped onto the solution structure of N-NTD provided a set of 'active' solvent-accessible residues on N-NTD that were expanded to surrounding 'passive' residues. The selection criteria for active residues were that their CSP values were more than one standard deviation from the average value (0.05 ppm) calculated for the entire set of CSPs and that their accessibility to solvent was more than 20% (6) . Restraints for the RNA molecule were kept ambiguous to avoid potential bias. A standard docking protocol yielded a set of water-refined conformations for the protein:RNA complex that were clustered into several distinct classes. As expected, the RNA duplex molecule was bound in the positively charged cleft in all clusters. The most populated cluster also contained the fewest violations of experimental restraints and was therefore selected as a representative conformation for the N-NTD: RNA complex.",

The most promising drug is remdesivir, a nucleotide analog that targets the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp). Viral polymerases are certainly good targets for antiviral compounds as these enzymes are absolutely vital for any +RNA virus. However, every viral protein is a potential target for antiviral compounds and an effective treatment may require several active compounds, each targeting a different protein at the same time. This approach, known as HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy), has proven effective in the case of HIV, which is another virus with an RNA genome.

First, the combined automated NOE assignment and structure determination protocol (CANDID) was used for automatic NOE cross-peak assignment. Subsequently, five cycles of simulated annealing combined with redundant dihedral angle restraints were used to calculate a set of converged structures with no significant restraint violations (distance and van der Waals violations <0.5\u00c5 and dihedral angle constraint violations <5\u00b0). The 40 structures with the least restraint violations were further refined in explicit solvent using the YASARA software with the YASARA forcefield(13) and subjected to further analysis using the Protein Structure Validation Software suite (www.nesg.org). The statistics for the resulting structure is summarized in Table 1 . The structures, NMR restraints and resonance assignments were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB, accession code: 6YI3) and BMRB (accession code: 34511).",

The CSP of each assigned resonance in the 2D 15 N/ 1 H HSQC spectra of the protein in the free state is calculated as the geometrical distance in ppm to the peak in the 2D 15 N/ 1 H HSQC spectra acquired under different conditions using the formula: \u0394 = \u221a \u0394 2 + (\u0394 \u2022 ) 2 , where \uf061 is a weighing factor of 0.2 used to account for differences in the proton and nitrogen spectral widths. (14) Molecular docking -The structure for the N-NTD in complex with the 7mer RNA duplex was calculated using HADDOCK (4) . The RNA homology model was prepared by mutating the native 7mer RNA duplex (PDB 4U37) (5) in Pymol (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0 Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC.) that was subsequently subjected to an energy minimization in YASARA (13) . For the actual docking, we used a representative structure from the set of obtained structures and followed a standard protocol. As active were selected those N-NTD residues with CSP > 0.05 ppm and at least 20% solvent accessibility (A50, T57, H59, R92, I94, S105, R107, R149, A152 and Y172), while as passive were additionally selected adjacent solvent exposed residues (T49, T54, L55, R88, A90, K102, L104, Y109, Y111, P151, A155, A156, E174 and G175).

In addition, in total three regions within the N-NTD were defined as fully flexible segments for the advanced stages of the docking calculation (the N-terminal G1-T9, the central loop I54-M61 and the C-terminal S136-S140). The final set of 200 water-refined structures was clustered using a Fraction of Common Contacts approach (15) with a default cut-off 0.75 and a minimal cluster size = 4. The resulting structures were sorted into 7 clusters and the most populated cluster (n = 30) that also exhibited the lowest interaction energy was selected for detailed analysis. ",
