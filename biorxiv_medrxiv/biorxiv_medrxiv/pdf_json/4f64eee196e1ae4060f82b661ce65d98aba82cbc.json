We contrasted the binding interactions between human ACE2 and coronavirus spike protein receptor binding domains (RBDs) from (i) SARS-CoV-2, (ii) the related but less virulent OC43 (Singapore COVID-19 strain), and (iii) the 2002 epidemiccausing SARS-CoV-1. We find that the RBDs of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 are highly optimized to achieve the strongest possible binding interaction with ACE2 which is consistent with its enhanced pathogenicity. SARS-CoV-2 RBDs form the most stable complex with ACE2 (64.91%, and 28.07% higher binding scores than SARS-CoV-1 and OC43, respectively) while occupying the greatest number of residues in the ATR1 binding site. In fact, the spike protein RBDs from SARS-CoV-2 out-compete the angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1) which is the native binding partner of ACE2 by 64% in terms of binding affinity (quantified using the Rosetta scoring function). They accomplish this through strong electrostatic attachments with every fourth residue on the N-terminus alpha-helix (starting from Ser19 to Asn53) as the turn of the helix makes these residues solvent accessible. We further discern biophysical insights that explain higher susceptibility by cats, while dogs show lower and chicken no susceptibility to the virus. These results offer a computational explanation for the increased pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and allude to therapeutic modalities by identifying and rank-ordering the ACE2 residues involved in binding with the virus.",

Next, we focus on the role of glycine residues (see Figure 4 ) in all three spike RBDs which form important electrostatic contacts with ACE2 as they lead to more than 55% loss of binding (on average) upon mutation to alanine.

Atomic coordinates of both these complexes were independently, and experimentally confirmed by Song et al. 3 in 2018 and Wang et al. in 2020 (manuscript unpublished but structure deposited at -www.rcsb.org/structure/6lzg). In both cases the SARS-CoV spike RBD uses a combination of a cation-and a strong electrostatic interaction to bind with Lys353. The electrostatic interaction is mediated by Asn501 in SARS-CoV-2 and Thr487 in SARS-CoV-1. Two glycine residues and a short hydrophobic group together allows the Asn501 (and Thr487 for SARS-CoV-1) to be within strong electrostatic reach of Lys353 while ensuring a cation-interaction between Tyr505 (and Tyr491 for SARS-CoV-1) and Lys353. Mutation Y505A (or Y491A for SARS-CoV-1) has no effect on ACE2 binding. However, mutation to alanine of either Gly502 or Asn501 (or their corresponding residues in SARS-CoV-1) leads to >70% loss of ACE2 binding. Thus, we recover a strong functional motif, which is conserved between the two SARS-CoV strains as seen in Figure 5 .",

In an uninfected cell, through the action of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 forms a complex with the angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1) 4 . Due to the lack of an experimentally resolved structure for the ACE2-ATR1 complex, we used protein-protein docking and Rosetta-binding score screening to identify the most stable configuration of the complex. Analysis of the ACE2-ATR1 binding interface reveals 41 ACE2 residues and 26 ATR1 residues at the interface connected by five strong electrostatic contacts and several long range weak electrostatic contacts. We find that eleven SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding residues of ACE2 are shared by the ATR1 binding region. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RBD binds ACE2 with ~64% better binding score than ATR1. In contrast, SARS-CoV-1 show ~2.1% worse binding score with ACE2 compared to the ACE2-ATR1 complex while sharing only nine residues with the ATR1 binding interface of ACE2 (see Figure 6 ). These numbers indicate that SARS-CoV-2 (and OC43) outcompete the ATR1-ACE2 complex thus facilitating the formation of the ACE2-spike complex whereas SARS-CoV-1 cannot. This is in line with their respective viral infection rates. We computationally explored the potentially available margin of improvement for the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 using the IPRO 5 protein design software. We allowed all 21 contacting residues of the RBD of the spike protein to simultaneously mutate. We run two separate design trajectories and, in both cases the best design achieved an approximately 25% improvement in binding affinity using the Rosetta scoring function. This improvement is less than the difference between the calculated binding scores of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 implying that SARS-CoV-2 has already achieved most of the theoretically possible binding affinity gain with ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-1. Interestingly, the network of glycine residues in SARS-CoV-2 is conserved in all redesigned RBDs.",

Similar to SARS-CoV-1 7 , it has been reported that felines are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 followed by canines 8 whereas chickens and ferrets are less susceptible 8 . As seen in Figure 7 the calculated Rosetta binding energies largely, but not entirely, follow the trends expected from their respective sequence identities with the human ACE2 (see supplementary information for full sequence alignment). In all cases, the Rosetta binding energies for all animal ACE2s were at most 78.3% of the one calculated with hACE2. We found that feline ACE2 had the closest (78.3% of hACE2-spike RBD) Rosetta binding energy with the spike (see Figure 8 for contrasting spike interactions between feline and canine ACE2). Bovine ACE2 even though it is closer to human (95.2% seq. id. vs. 92.9% for feline) had the lowest Rosetta binding energy (72.2%) among all tested animal ACE2s except for chicken. Canine and equine ACE2 were similar and in between feline and bovine in terms of their Rosetta binding energies. Chicken ACE2 is by far the most distant from human and also was predicted to be the least effective in binding the viral spike protein RBD. These findings seem to be in broad agreement with the literature reports on the relative animal susceptibility to COVID-19. shows an electrostatic link between Tyr442 and His34, while canine ACE2 establishes a self-stabilizing salt bridge between Lys30 and Gly34, thus disallowing spike Tyr442 from establishing an electrostatic contact with any nearby ACE2 residue.",

We also provide key biophysical insights to explain the difference in pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to OC43 and SARS-CoV-1. Multiple lines of computational evidence indicate that the spike RBDs gain entry into the human cell through electrostatic attachment with every fourth residue on the N-terminal alpha-helix (starting from Ser19 to Asn53) as the turn of the helix makes these residues solvent accessible. Results from computational models of canine, feline, bovine, equine, and chicken ACE2 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD reveal residue-level underpinnings that explain why felines show highest, canines much lower, and chicken almost no susceptibility to COVID-",

Implicit solvation treats the water as a dielectric continuum. The rotational sampling interval was set to 10\u00b0. Clustering of the docked poses were done at an 8 \u00c5 cutoff. Subsequently, PyRosetta 13 scripts were written to rank and identify the most stable complexes from each cluster which were then energy-minimized and re-ranked. Finally, the complex which ranked high in stability and binding scores was chosen as the model. An alanine scan was again performed using PyRosetta scripts, where the computational models of the alanine variants were first generated, energy minimized, and ACE2 binding scores computed. The ACE2 interface definitions for each binding partner (RBDs and ATR1) were obtained by feeding the energy minimized proteinprotein complexes through the find_contacts module of OptMAVEn-2.0 14 .",
