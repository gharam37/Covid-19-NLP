            "text": "There is a rapidly expanding literature on the in vitro antiviral activity of drugs that may be repurposed for therapy or chemoprophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. However, this has not been accompanied by a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of these drugs to achieve target plasma and lung concentrations following approved dosing in humans. Moreover, most publications have focussed on 50% maximum effective concentrations (EC50), which may be an insufficiently robust indicator of antiviral activity because of marked differences in the slope of the concentration-response curve between drugs. Accordingly, in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity data was digitised from all available publications up to 13 th April 2020 and used to recalculate an EC90 value for each drug. EC90 values were then expressed as a ratio to the achievable maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) reported for each drug after administration of the approved dose to humans (Cmax/EC90 ratio). Only 14 of the 56 analysed drugs achieved a Cmax/EC90 ratio above 1 meaning that plasma Cmax concentrations exceeded those necessary to inhibit 90% of SARS-CoV-2 replication. A more in-depth assessment of the putative agents tested demonstrated that only nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir) and sulfadoxine achieved plasma concentrations above their reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity across their entire approved dosing interval at their approved human dose. For all drugs reported, the unbound lung to plasma tissue partition coefficient (KpUlung) was also simulated and used along with reported Cmax and fraction unbound in plasma to derive a lung Cmax/EC50 as a better indicator of potential human efficacy (lung Cmax/EC90 ratio was also calculable for a limited number of drugs). Using this parameter hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, mefloquine, atazanavir (boosted with ritonavir), tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir), ivermectin, azithromycin and lopinavir (boosted with ritonavir) were all predicted to achieve lung concentrations over 10-fold higher than their reported EC50. This analysis was not possible for nelfinavir because insufficient data were available to calculate KpUlung but nitozoxanide and sulfadoxine were also predicted to exceed their reported EC50 by 3.1-and 1.5-fold in lung, respectively. The antiviral activity data reported to date have been acquired under different laboratory conditions across multiple groups, applying variable levels of stringency. However, this analysis may be used to select potential candidates for further clinical testing, while deprioritising compounds which are unlikely to attain target concentrations for antiviral activity. Future studies should focus on EC90 values and discuss findings in the context of achievable exposures in humans, especially within target compartments such as the lung, in order to maximise the potential for success of proposed human clinical trials.",

This rapidly expanding pandemic warrants the urgent development of strategies, particularly to protect people at high risk of infection. Repurposing currently available drugs that have been utilised clinically with a known safety profile, is the quickest way to address this serious unmet clinical need. Antiviral drugs are urgently required for treatment of patients with mild/moderate disease to prevent the worsening of symptoms and reduce the burden upon healthcare systems. However, a different approach is likely to be needed for patients that are already in a critical state, due to the immune dysregulation which is so apparent in severe cases [3] .",

A study on normal lung tissue showed that 83% of ACE2-expressing cells were alveolar epithelial type II cells [5] , highlighting the lungs as the primary target organ that facilitate viral invasion and replication. Furthermore, the ACE2 receptor is also highly expressed in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, with SARS-CoV-2 RNA observed to be present in stool specimens of patients during infection [1, 6] . A recent retrospective analysis of 85 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 also indicated that SARS-CoV-2 infects human kidney tubules and induces acute tubular damage in some patients [7] . Furthermore, 2-11% of patients with COVID-19 exhibit liver comorbidities [8] . Of note is an observation of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) having a tropism to the gastrointestinal tract [9] and causing liver impairments in addition to respiratory disease. The genomic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (79.6% sequence identity) would imply that the current virus would act in a similar manner and be present within the body systemically [10] [11] [12] . Therefore, treatment options that provide therapeutic concentrations of drug(s) within the systemic circulation and other affected organs are likely to be required.",

The formulae provided in these methods use the physicochemical properties of the drug (pKa, log P, classification as acid/base/neutral) and in vitro drug binding information (fraction unbound in plasma, blood to plasma ratio), in combination with tissue specific data (lipid content, volumes of intra/extracellular water etc.) to predict tissue KpU values.

However, it should be noted that for amodiaquine, atazanavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, mefloquine, nelfinavir, remdesevir and toremefine, more than one EC50 value had been reported across the available literature and these were not always in agreement ( Figure 1A) . Moreover, this variability in reported EC50 values sometimes resulted in Cmax / EC50 ratios giving a different estimation of the likely value of the molecule. Meaning that for the same drug, the Cmax / EC50 ratio could be above or below 1 ( Figure   1B ). For amodiaquine and toremifene all reported EC50 values were below their reported Cmax and only for nelfinavir was the reported Cmax expected to exceed both reported EC50 values. For atazanavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, mefloquine and remdesivir, some EC50 values were above the Cmax whereas other were below. This observation dramatically highlights the sensitivity of the current analysis to the reported antiviral activity data, and this should be taken into account when interpreting the data presented hereafter.",

The mechanism of antiviral action is not fully understood for nitazoxanide, but it has been reported to affect viral genome synthesis, prevent viral entry and interfere with the N-glycosylation and maturation of the influenza hemagglutinin [46] [47] [48] [49] . Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is also highly N-glycosylated [50] . This drug has also been shown to elicit an innate immune response that potentiates the production of type 1 interferons [46, 51] and a phase 2b/3 clinical trial demonstrated a reduction in symptoms and viral shedding in patients with uncomplicated influenza [42] . The safety of nitazoxanide is well understood, but it has not been fully investigated during renal or hepatic impairment. The antiviral activity of nitazoxanide for SARS-CoV-2 requires further study but the existing data for this drug are encouraging. Niclosamide is another antiprotozoal drug that exhibits broad antiviral activity due to its ability to perturb the pH-dependent membrane fusion required for virus entry [52] but it was reported to have no impact upon the attachment and entry of SARS-CoV-2",

Sulfadoxine inhibits the activity of dihydropteroate synthase within the malaria parasite, but its mechanism of action for SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. It should also be noted that the authors can find no data describing antiviral activity of this drug against other viruses. Also, the concentrations used in the in vitro activity used in this analysis [26] were not high enough to reach or calculate an EC90 value. Therefore, like other molecules described in this manuscript in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity should be repeated. Notwithstanding, sulfadoxine plasma concentrations far above the reported EC50 are maintained in patients receiving a single 1500 mg dose (with 75 mg pyrimethamine) for over 40 days [72] . Compared to some other reported molecules sulfadoxine is not expected to have as high an accumulation in the lungs, but concentrations higher than its EC50 are estimated from the analysis of its lung KpU.

            "text": "During inflammation or injury, changes to the vascular microenvironment, could have a profound effect on the ability of these drugs to accumulate in lung cells. Due to the recruitment of neutrophils and leaky endothelial cells [73] , the lung inflammatory microenvironment is characterized by increased body temperature, excessive enzymic activity and most importantly, by a low interstitial pH [74] . In the case of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, these diprotic weak bases are exquisitely dependent on a pH gradient to drive lysosomal uptake as a mechanism of lung accumulation. It has been demonstrated that cellular chloroquine uptake is diminished one hundred-fold for every pH unit of external acidification [75] . This situation is likely to deteriorate further on mechanical ventilation, which also induces acidification of the lung tissue, independently of inflammation [76, 77] . Therefore, the benefits of lung accumulation for many of these drugs may be lost during treatment of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conversely, mefloquine is monoprotic and more lipophilic than chloroquine, which may make it much less reliant on the pH gradient to drive cellular accumulation in lung. It is likely that the charged form of the drug is sufficiently lipophilic to allow movement across biological membranes along a concentration gradient [78] . Only two studies have described mefloquine uptake into cells, one study suggested that mefloquine uptake is not energy-dependent and the other suggested that mefloquine uptake is mediated by secondary active transport, rather than passive proton trapping [79, 80] . Mefloquine is known to cause severe psychiatric side effects in some patients and so use of this drug should be managed with care [81] . Therefore, mefloquine may offer opportunities for treatment during severe disease that are not available with other drugs currently being tested for COVID-19 therapy. If the high lung exposures are proven empirically for the drugs on this list, then some may also prove to be valuable for chemoprevention strategies.",

Fifthly, robust pharmacokinetic data were not available for all the molecules and subtle differences have been reported in the pharmacokinetics in different studies. Where possible, this analysis utilised the pharmacokinetics described at the highest doses approved for other indications and checked them to ensure that profound differences were not evident between different studies. However, in some cases higher doses and/or more frequent dosing has been investigated for some of the drugs mentioned so higher exposures may be available for some drugs with off-label dosing. Sixthly, the digitised pharmacokinetic plots presented in this manuscript represent the mean or median profiles depending on what was presented in the original manuscripts. Many of the drugs presented are known to exhibit high inter-individual variability that is not captured within the presented analysis and it is possible that even for promising candidates a significant proportion of patients may have sub-therapeutic concentrations despite population mean/median being higher than the Cmax.

Those drugs with a ratio above 1 (shown in orange) were deemed to have potential to provide plasma concentrations sufficient to exert at least some antiviral activity for at least some of their dosing interval at their approved dose. Drugs shown in green were predicted to exceed plasma concentrations over their EC90 by more than a two-fold. (dashed green lines) are also highlighted. References for the utilised data are nitazoxanide 500mg BID and 1000mg BID [87] , tipranavir 500mg BID with 200mg ritonavir [88] , sulfadoxine 1500mg with 75mg pyrimethamine [72] , nelfinavir 1250mg BID [89] , indomethacin 50mg TID [90] , atazanavir 300mg QD with 100mg ritonavir [91] , hydroxychloroquine 2000 mg hydroxychloroquine sulfate / 1550 mg base administered over 3 days [92] , Eltrombobag 75mg single dose [93] , lopinavir 400 mg with 100 mg ritonavir [94] , chloroquine 1500mg administered over 3 days [95] , mefloquine 1200mg over 3 days [96] , anidulafungin 100 mg QD [97] . Robust pharmacokinetic data were unavailable for niclosamide 500mg, ritonavir 600mg and merimepodib 300mg in order to conduct this digitised interrogation of these molecules. deemed not to provide lung concentrations at their approved doses to exert sufficient pulmonary antiviral activity for treatment or prevention strategies. Those drugs with a ratio above 1 (shown in orange) were estimated to provide lung concentrations sufficient to exert at least some antiviral activity at their approved dose. Drugs shown in green were predicted to exceed lung concentrations over their EC50 by more than a ten-fold.",

The implications of drug interactions have already been raised for this reason with lopinavir/ritonavir use for COVID-19 [60] and are likely to be exacerbated with the higher ritonavir dose needed for tipranavir. Moreover, tipranavir has a black box warning from the FDA for fatal and nonfatal intracranial haemorrhage as well as severe hepatotoxicity [61-63]. The major route of metabolic clearance for nelfinavir is via CYP2C19 and this pathway generates the M8 metabolite that retains activity against the HIV protease [64]. No data are available for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by the M8 metabolite but if active, this could provide and advantage for nelfinavir over tipranavir for COVID-19. Conversely, While the analysis of pharmacokinetics relative to potency of these molecules against SARS-CoV-2 is encouraging, it should be noted that the reported in vitro activity for HIV [58, 65] is far higher than that against SARS-CoV-2 and both drugs are highly protein bound [66, 67].
