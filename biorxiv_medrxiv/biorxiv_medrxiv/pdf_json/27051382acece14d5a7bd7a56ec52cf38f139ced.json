This pandemic highlighted a pressing clinical and public health need for rapid, scalable diagnostics that can detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, interrogate strain evolution, and map host response in patients. To address these challenges, we designed a fast (30 minute) colorimetric test to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection and simultaneously developed a large-scale shotgun metatranscriptomic profiling platform for nasopharyngeal swabs. Both technologies were used to profile 338 clinical specimens tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 86 NYC subway samples, creating a broad molecular picture of the COVID-19 epidemic in NYC. Our results nominate a novel, NYC-enriched SARS-CoV-2 subclade, reveal specific host responses in ACE pathways, and find medication risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and ACE inhibitors. Our findings have immediate applications to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, public health monitoring, and therapeutic development.",

Current approaches to molecular testing are mostly limited to hospital laboratories and are largely reserved for the most severe cases, with limited accessibility to the general population. As a result, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the population is mostly unknown, particularly among mild or asymptomatic cases.

Clinically positive samples showed a much higher fluorescence than negative samples, with superior performance observed with higher (10\u00b5L vs 5\u00b5L) input volumes (Supp. Figure 3b) . Clinically positive samples that failed to generate LAMP fluorescence were associated with lower viral genome abundance (high cycle threshold [Ct] value qRT-PCR). We obtained similar performance on bulk oropharyngeal swab lysate (Supp. Figure 3c -e), including increasing reaction sensitivity as a function of viral copy number. This required only a 30-minute lysis time for the oral collections and 30-minute LAMP reaction time.

These data provide evidence that false negatives from qRT-PCR are likely rare (3-6/205, or 1.4-2.8%), but may require orthogonal assays to reliably detect.",

However, there were distinct variations in known respiratory viruses, including human coronaviruses 229E, NL63, and HKU1, as well as influenza A, rhinovirus (A and C), and respiratory syncytial virus (Supp Figure 7a ). As expected, most patients (129/133) that presented with the SARS-CoV-2 virus lacked reads associated with other respiratory viruses. A subset of patients (4/133, 3.0%) also harbored Influenza A. These cases were enriched in the lower titer (bottom third) of COVID-19 positive (3/4) patients. One patient carried SARS-CoV-2, human metapneumovirus, and coronavirus NL63 at the same time (Supp Figure 7a,b) . These results indicate that a positive test for common respiratory viruses does not rule out the presence of SARS-CoV-2. There was also an associated depletion of several species of Streptococcus, Veillonella, and Prevotella in the high viral patient category (Supp Figure 7c ) that was co-incident with SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating a possible disruption of the host microbiome at the airway site of the NP swab collection.",

All six of these variants were significantly enriched (Bonferroni-adjusted p-value <0.05) in a second analysis comparing A2a GISAID cases from NYC vs. the rest of the world (Figure 5a ). Visualizing these variants across the Nextstrain derived phylogenetic tree (Figure 5b) , demonstrated that the highest frequency of these variants (1059C>T, 25563G>T), defined a novel subclade of A2a, which we call A2a-25563. This subclade comprised 82% (281 / 344) of (NYPH-WCMC and GISAID) NYC samples, and 92.7% (281/303) of the A2a portion of NYC cases. Interestingly, while both of the NYPH-WCMC A2a cases harboring the aforementioned NSP1 9-bp deletion were in A2a-25563, many of the remaining cases were distributed across other subclades.

We first integrated the LAMP, qRT-PCR, and total RNA-Seq viral load estimates to identify a final set of 93 SARS-CoV-2 positive (COVID-19 positive) and 204 negative (COVID-19 negative) cases with coverage across the host and viral genomes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were calculated using DESeq2. (see Methods). Overall, 5,982 significant DEGs (q<0.01, >1.5-fold change) were found for the COVID-19 positive samples (Supp . Table 3 ) , spanning 2,942 upregulated DEGs and 3,040 down-regulated DEGs, which could be separated into high, medium, and low viral response categories based on the three detection methodologies (qRT-PCR, NGS, and LAMP) (Figure 6b ). To test for the possibility of cell proportion changes due to infection, we used Bisque to predict the cell types for all COVID samples, which showed consistent cell distributions of mostly goblet and ciliated airway cells for all samples (Supp. Figure 9 )",

Since ACE2 expression can be increased in patients taking ACEIs, the observed correlation of viral titer with ACE2 expression may be attributed to the pre-infection use of such inhibitors, which is common in older patients and those with comorbidities (Fang et al., 2020) . To address this, we analyzed an observational cohort of 8,278 patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from NYPH-CUIMC were analyzed for their usage of ACEIs (4,574 who tested positive). We found that use of ACEIs was strongly associated with testing positive in patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Odds Ratio, OR=3.06, and 95% Confidence Interval, CI= 2.38-3.94, p=2.44E -18 ). This result was also consistent when corrected for age, sex, and IL-6, where exposure to ACEIs has an OR=1.54, and when corrected for other reported clinical covariates (1.18-2.01, p=1.41E -03 ); patients exposed to ACEIs were 1.85 (1.40-2.44,p=1.71E -05 ) times more likely to test positive. In the univariate analysis, ACEI usage conferred an increased risk of intubation and mortality for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients ( (Figure 6f) .",

While hospital-grade, core lab devices can achieve massive throughput (thousands of samples per day), a key limitation of these assays is accessibility of testing facilities (even roadside testing stations) to patients and the logistics of sample transport and timely test reporting. These limitations become even more stark in the context of widespread quarantines and nationwide lockdowns, where requiring patients to travel (even for viral testing) incurs significant personal and public health risks. The most urgent diagnostic need in this situation is for scalable rapid point-of-care tests that can be potentially implemented in the home. Our validation of a rapid one-tube colorimetric SARS-CoV-2 assay with both qRT-PCR and total RNA-seq provides a potential solution to this problem. Further work will be needed to assess whether this LAMP assay can detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 at lower (but clinically relevant) viral concentrations in specimen types that are less cumbersome to collect than naso-/ oro-pharyngeal swabs (e.g. saliva, stool). As we demonstrate, this LAMP SARS-CoV2 can be also applied for environmental sampling, which may be crucial in the containment phase of this pandemic. Specifically, LAMP positivity may quickly indicate if an area is infectious and a negative result (with appropriate confirmation) will possibly represent a lower risk. Indeed, these tools and methods can help create a viral \"weather report\" if broadly used and partnered with continual validation.",

Though remaining NYC cases show a wide distribution across all identified clades, the predominance (>80% in NYC) of such a narrowly defined set of sequences within NYC from a rare (\u226420%) Western European subclade is striking. These results suggest either (1) a very early introduction by a single patient harboring A2a-25563; or (2) multiple A2a-25563 founder events; or (3) disproportionate community transmission of strains within this subclade. The latter possibility could be consistent with A2a-25563 harboring differential fitness with respect to transmissibility or virulence relative to other A2a viruses. Future studies correlating viral genotypes with patient outcomes in larger cohorts will be necessary to determine whether any of these A2a-25563 associated variants, including the 9 bp in-frame deletion in NSP1 (p.141_143KSD), functionally influence viral transmission or disease severity. The polyphyletic pattern of NSP1 p.141_143KSD, comprising both patients within and beyond A2a-25563, including clades outside of A2a, raises the possibility that this variant arose multiple times and may be under positive selection.

For example, if some patients are more susceptible because they are already expressing high levels of ACE2, this could help with targeting ACE2 in these patients as a prophylactic method. However, if the cells respond to infection with ACE2 expression, and this leads to the cytokine storm seen in patients, then this could be used as a downstream treatment (post-infection), for when ACE2 interacts with TMPRSS2, such as the ongoing trials with camostat mesylate (Hoffman et al., 2020) . Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 has been found to induce phosphorylation of STAT1 and increases in ISG proteins, a mechanism not previously seen in SARS-CoV, suggesting a potential molecular mechanism behind the upregulation of interferon response (Lokugamage et al., 2020).",

However, further studies comparing nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and buccal collection approaches, as well as a comparison of different swab types, are needed. Depending on the availability of reagents and resources, as well as automation, a LAMP-based approach on such sample types could allow facilities to increase testing capabilities by orders of magnitude. Since viral pandemics can have significant, long-lasting detrimental impacts for affected countries, it is crucial to deploy methods that can track and profile cases (e.g. RNA-seq, LAMP, qRT-PCR) and provide a comprehensive view of host and viral biology. These methods can help mitigate the medical and socioeconomic harm from viral outbreaks, as well as establish protective surveillance networks that can help defend against future outbreaks.",

This specifically utilized the LAMP-compatible primers for the on the COVID-19 reference genome (NCBI). LAMP's inherent specificity (using 4-6 primers vs. 2 for PCR amplification) in combination with this in-silico analysis revealed there is limited opportunity for cross-reactivity to allow for false-positive reporting or affect performance of the N-gene primers for SARS-CoV-2 detection (Supp Table 5 ). Overall, the primers had less than 80% homology with the vast majority of tested pathogen sequences. For any organisms where a primer hit >80% homology, only one of the primers (forward or reverse) had significant homology making an amplified product extremely unlikely. Overall, the results of this analysis predict no significant crossreactivity or microbial interference. We also assessed the potential impact of sequence variation in circulating strains that might lead to poor amplification. In the thousands of sequences deposited in GISAID (Shu and McCauley, 2017) , only one site in the priming region was observed to be polymorphic. The polymorphism (T30359C) was only observed in 106 of 6753 (<2%) sequences with coverage of this region. This variant overlaps the priming site of the LB primer but is not near a 3-prime end and is not anticipated to cause amplification failure. ",

The individual call sets were merged using bcftools (Li, 2011) (merge -g) and allele counts were added with bcftools view (-q 0.01) . Population-level variants across all samples were converted in a presence/absence matrix using a customized script where every SNV was counted as present if it was supported by at least 5% of the reads. This matrix was loaded in R and underwent hierarchical clustering using the function dist with the euclidean method and hclust using the average method. All samples were further analyzed using Manta (Chen et al., 2016) , and subsequently summarized and filtered using the SURVIVOR pipeline (Jeffares et al., 2017) . Subsequently, SV calls were re-genotyped using SVTyper (doi:10.1038/nmeth.3505) and a population-level VCF was generated using SURIVOR merge (allowing for 100bp maximum distance). Events were filtered for only <1000bp insertions and deletions that were homozygous in a sample.",

Samples that had more than 10 million human mapped reads were used for differential expression analysis. Reads, as reported by featureCounts, were normalized using variance-stabilizing transform (vst) in DESeq2 package in R (Love et al., 2014) for visualization purposes in log-scale. DESeq2 was used to call differential expression with either Positive cases vs Negative, or viral load (High/Medium/Low/None) as reported by either qRT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values or the combination viral load method as explained before. Genes with BH-adjusted p-value < 0.01 and absolute log2 fold-change greater than 0.58 (at least 50% change in either direction) were taken as significantly differentially regulated (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) . The complete gene list for all comparisons are given in Supp Table 3 . Resulting gene sets were ranked using log2 fold-change values within each comparison and put into GSEA to calculate gene set enrichment for molecular signatures database (MSigDB), MGI Mammalian Phenotypes database and ENCODE transcription factor binding sets (Liberzon et al., 2011; Subramanian et al., 2005; Sergushichev, 2016; Smith et al., 2018) .

Patients with a history of ACE inhibitor exposure were more likely to require intubation (HR=2.63 95%CI 2.01-3.43, p=1.22E-12; (e) and less likely to survive (HR=1.68 95%CI: 1.22-2.31, p=1.42E-03; (f). Because several individuals were intubated shortly before they first tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, each first positive test was set back by seven days to account for testing delays. author/funder.

ACEI Multivariate and Comparative Analyses. (a) Regression coefficients for variables indicating exposure/history of exposure to ACE inhibitors for each of the three cohort comparisons: (left) test outcome in a cohort of patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, (middle) requirement of mechanical respiration in patients who tested positive, (right) mortality in patients who tested positive. Univariate analyses are shown as red circles. The green triangles coefficients are when correcting for age, sex, and baseline IL-6 levels take upon admission. The blue squares are from a model that includes age, sex, and IL-6 as well as comorbidities including CAD/CHD, diabetes, obesity, and self-reported race and ethnicity. (b) Comparison of the effects of different ACE inhibitors. We directly compared the effects of specific ACE inhibitors among those patients with evidence of exposure to ACE inhibitors. We found two significant associations: benazepril was significantly associated with higher mortality (HR=2.37 95%CI 1.05-5.35, p=3.70E-02) and trandolapril was associated with requirement of mechanical ventilation (HR=15.85 95% CI: 2.11-119.08, p=7.25E-03).
