We screened 525 health workers of our Cancer Institute with rapid serological test Viva-Diag analyzingCOVID-19 associated-IgG/IgM. Six subjects (1,1%) resulted with Viva-Diag test not-negative for IgM. All 6 cases had RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test negative; repeating analysis ofIgG/IgM expression by CLIA assay also, 2 cases resulted IgM positive and 1 case IgG/IgM positive. This latter subject reported a contact with an infected SARS-CoV-2 person, a month earlier.In conclusion our study seems to suggest: a) a different analytical sensitivity inIgG/IgM evaluation for Viva-Diag and CLIA assays needing to be further determined; b) the ability of Viva-Diagrapid COVID-19 test to evidence health workers positive for Immunoglobulins expression. Discordant results of rapid serological tests with respect to RT-PCR stress the different clinical meaning the two assays can have, question clearly referring to further studies to optimize the utilization of rapid serological test in asymptomatic subjects at high risk for infection.",

A surface antigen from SARS-CoV-2 which can specifically bind to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (including both IgM and IgG) is conjugated to colloidal gold nanoparticles and sprayed onto conjugate pads. The SARS-CoV-2 rapid IgG-IgM combined antibody test strip has two mouse anti-human monoclonal antibodies (anti-IgG and anti-IgM) stripped on two separated test lines. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies is indicated by a red/purple line that appears in the specific region for those antibodieson the device. If the specimen did not contain SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, no labeled complexes were bound. Each test was evaluated by two operators and a picture was taken of the result.

Our finding that subjects who were positive for COVID-specific IgM/IgG did not present any viral load is in agreement with Lou (13) who reported that higher Ig levels can be asynchronous with respect to viral presence and that can persist long time aftervirus RT-PCR testsbecome negative.One more point that drew our attention wasthe difference between VivaDiag TM and CLIA in detecting the twoimmunoglobulins. SNIBE (www.SNIBE.com) recently announcedthat its MAGLUMI SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG Kits receivedits CE mark. Considering the cases that tested positivewith theVivaDiag TM kitand negative withthe CLIAMAGLUMIkit, it would appearthatthe VivaDiag TM testcould have a greater analytical sensitivity. However, our study was not designed to directly compare the performances of the two assays and, then, we cannot exclude conversely a better specificity of CLIAMAGLUMI kit. This because negative cases at VivaDiag TM kit were not tested with the CLIAassay. This aspect will be further investigated in ournext trialin which all cases will be double,Viva-Diag and CLIA MAGLUMI kits, tested. Separate discussion deserves the case strongly positive for IgG/IgM at both serological tests. The subject was a nurse who referred contacts with a COVID-19 patient 30-days before and then it is easy to relate herIg positivity to that event. It is the first time that a screening with rapid serological test individualize a single asymptomatic health worker with presumed passed virus infection within a cohort of hundreds of subjects.",

The swabs were subjected to nucleic acid extraction by MagNA Pure (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The presence of the E gene, RdRP gene and N gene of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were identified by a commercial real-time PCR assay (Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay; Seegene, Seoul, Republic of Korea). Samples were considered positive at molecular screening if all the three genes were detected. The WHO Real-time-PCR protocol was used to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV2(https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/uscdcrt-pcr-panel-fordetection-instructions.pdf?sfvrsn=3aa07934_2).Chemiluminescence (CLIA) IgG/IgM detectionThe IgG/IgM dosage was determined utilizing MAGLUMI TM 2019-nCoV IgG (Cat.
