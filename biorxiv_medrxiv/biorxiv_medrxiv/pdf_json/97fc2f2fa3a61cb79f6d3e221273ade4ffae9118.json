Especially a good choice of \u03b2 as the number of others that one infected person encounters per unit time (per day) influences the adequateness of the results of the model. For the example of the actual COVID-19 pandemic some aspects of the parameter choice will be discussed. Because of the incompatibility of the data of the Johns-Hopkins-University [3] to the data of the German Robert-Koch-Institut we use the COVID-19 data of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [2] (ECDC) as a base for the parameter estimation. Two different mathematical methods for the data analysis will be discussed in this paper and possible sources of trouble will be shown.",

This group has a significant higher mortality rate than the rest of the infected people. Thus we can presume that \u03b1=10% of I must be especially sheltered and possibly medicated very intensively as a highrisk group. This result proves the usefulness of a lockdown or a strict social distancing during an epidemic disease. We observe a flattening of the infection curve as requested by politicians and health professionals. With a strict social distancing for a limited time one can save time to find vaccines and time to improve the possibilities to help high-risk people in hospitals.",
