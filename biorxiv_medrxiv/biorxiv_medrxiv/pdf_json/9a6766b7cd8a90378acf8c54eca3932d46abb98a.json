Apart from biological properties, it is susceptible that few environmental, social and economic elements can act as possible catalysts for the spread of novel Coronavirus. First, connection with China is likely to be an important factor for rapid transmission of the disease at the initial stage of the pandemic. As the virus continues to spread many countries, any connection with badly effected countries may equally responsible for the transmission. In other words, level of international connection of a country is probably playing a vital role in country-tocountry transmission of the virus. International trade, alternatively economic openness can be treated as a good measure of international connection of a country. Thus, economic openness is likely to play an important role in the spread of the disease. If a country is more open, the virus will find it easier to transmit from human to human by crossing national borders. Once the virus is in, the rate of spread within a country will depend on several factors, some of which are difficult to identify, some though can be pointed out by educated guess. Population density, level of urbanization, social cohesiveness and weather conditions can be primarily identified as influential factors of human-to-human transmission of a pathogen. Viability of infectious viruses is found being affected markedly by environmental factors like temperature and humidity 3 .",

There is some evidence that fear of economic penalties sometimes lead authorities to under-report epidemics 4 . Countries of autocratic rulers are reluctant to reveal exact or approximate number of cases as it may hamper their reign adversely. Moreover, social cohesiveness is likely to be higher in free societies leading to possibilities of more infections of a highly pathogenic disease. Though, democratization does not necessarily mean social cohesiveness or integrity, it can be used as a proxy to assess how much the citizens of a society are involved in social activities. If social activities are higher, the chance of more infections are higher. Thus, the level of democratization is a possible inducer of the number of cases of infection.",

The realized value is a random selection from a range of possible values that could be generated by the interaction of all factors. Though it is not easy to reveal the true characteristics of the underlying data generation process, the realized or observed values can be utilized to draw inferences about the process. As a stochastic process the important determinant of the number of cases of a day is its own past values, implying that Yt, the number of cases on a day, depend on the past values, i.e. Yt-1, Yt-2, Yt-3 etc. Hence, an autoregressive model may be suitable to approximate the data generation process of the cases of infection on a day. Nevertheless, our aim in this study is not to find the data generation process of total number of cases of a country on a specific day. Rather, our objective is to examine data to investigate any possible linkage between country level severities of infection with few selected environmental, economic and social variables.

The WHO declared a global health emergency on January 30. Two months afterward was the time of Corona. The number of infected people was rising rapidly. Due to time variation across countries, figures on infection and death by Coronavirus on a specific day differs slightly by sources. As published on the website of ECDC, on 05 April 2020 world-wide total confirmed cases of infection reaches at 1174652 and world-wide total number of deaths reaches at 64400. The global number of infections of Coronavirus is becoming doubles just in 8 days and the number of deaths in 7 days. After China, the worst affected regions are Europe and USA. Europe is expecting a downturn after a long upward rise, while USA is supposed to experience the rise further. Many third world countries of Asia and Africa have just started experiencing of COVID-19, with huge anxiety about possible fatality that may happen. The trends of China, Europe and USA in the figure-1 indicate a similar steepness, whereas they differ in time of spread. The graph of India, another populous country, now at its early stage of infection, exhibits almost similar steepness. Patterns of daily new cases for Italy, Europe, USA and India are almost similar showing a very steep upward trend, though fluctuations are more obvious in case of Italy.",

On the other hand, number of cases of infection in a country will usually be accelerated by the number of imported cases from abroad, either from China or via other country. If more people enter a country as a vector of the pathogen, the secondary number of cases must be higher inflating the total number of cases. The number of imported infection cases is likely to increase if the country is involved in higher degree of international trade indicating economic openness as a determining factor of the ongoing pandemic. Many social conditions of a country may influence the shape of the spread. A cohesive society where people are involved in more festivals or religion gatherings is more likely to have more cases. Many other cultural issues may also have connection with the disease. We consider the level of democratization as a proxy variable for social cohesiveness. Population density is also likely to have positive association with the spread of COVID-19. Data sources and characteristics Data on Coronavirus infection cases along with population in 2018 are collected from the website of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Average yearly temperature and average precipitation data were collected from meteoblue.com and indexmundi.com respectively. Openness data as defined by ratio of international trade to GDP were downloaded from Databank of the World Bank. The scores of democracy index 2019, compiled by Economist Intelligence Unit, UK, is collected from Wikipedia. As the sources are various in type, we cannot include all by COVID-19 in our analysis due to unavailability of all data for few countries. Total 163 countries are included in this analysis. Total number of cases of Coronavirus infection by countries is time variant. The number accumulates over time. Nonetheless, total cases of infection in a specific country on a specific day (Y) is a fixed number. Thus, the variable, total cases of infection by countries has both time series and cross-section elements. We collect data on total infection cases by countries from 31 December 2019 to 03 April 2020. Total cases of infection are converted to cases per one million population to capture the population effect. Cases of infection per one million people on 03 April 2020 by countries is denoted by Y and used as the dependent variable in our experimentation.Values of this variable obviously depend on its previous values. Consequently, Y is simultaneously a cross-section and time series variable. We consider country level yearly average temperature and precipitation as environmental variables. On the other hand, the economic and social variables, viz. openness, democracy index and population density are also measured on yearly basis. Accordingly, the explanatory variables we are dealing with are static in nature.",

If model (2) represents a true relationship, then it will suffer from multicollinearity as lagged Y must have high correlation with time invariant explanatory variables included in the regression equation. In the presence of multicollinearity, the estimated coefficients will be biased. To get rid of the multicollinearity problem, we first regress the lagged Y on rest of the explanatory variables and get the residual series. Henceforth, we run the following regression-",

Inclusion of more social and economic variables, for instance, level of urbanization, level of globalization, trade share with China etc. in the regression model may increase model validity. As the number of cases of infection accumulates over time for each country, panel data analysis including more time variant relevant variables may produce interesting outcomes. Government interventions are likely to influence the spread mechanism of Coronavirus and thus success of those interventions should be explored by further research. The results of this analysis should be interpreted cautiously keeping in mind the fact that statistical relations do not necessarily imply causation.
