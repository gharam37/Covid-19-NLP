            "text": "A novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has already spread into 186 countries and territories around the world (as of March 21st, 2020). With over half a million confirmed infections and over 24 thousand deaths (as of March 26th, 2020), it became a global challenge. COVID-19, the disease caused by this coronavirus, was characterised as a pandemic by WHO on 11th of March 2020. While a number of different measures to contain the virus have been implemented by countries all over the world, their effectiveness remains to be seen. The models used to inform decision-makers are differing significantly in their basic assumptions because it is the first coronavirus of such an impact in terms of the number of fatal cases. Also the existing modelling approaches often use biased data for tuning parameters or assessing models quality. Until an effective treatment is available, the accuracy of these models and the decisions made on their basis are the major factors in reducing the overall mortality in the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple efforts of calculating the transmissibility of the SRAS-Cov-2 virus and its geo-temporal modelling have been undertaken, but none of the models succeeded to describe the pandemic at the global level. For those models the estimates of the basic reproduction number of the virus were typically obtained using only Chinese data on the number of diagnosed cases. Additionally the actual prevalence of the virus remains unknown, as many infections are mild, asymptomatic or with atypical symptoms. In fact, many COVID-19 cases pass unnoticed (in China, over 50% according to the research). This hampers successful modelling of the pandemic. This study presents the first global modelling of COVID-19 pandemic that builds on top of successful modelling framework GLEAM. The basic reproduction number for SARS-CoV-2 used in the simulation is 4 . 4. It is higher than the value proposed by WHO, but best-fits the observed number of diagnosed cases over 135 days in multiple countries around the globe. Our analysis also provides the estimation of the global rate of total diagnosed to undiagnosed cases of 0 . 0061. The set of parameters used in our simulation forms a solid foundation for further modelling of the pandemic. In this study, we present putatively the first global model of SARS-CoV-2 spread that within confidence intervals accurately depicts the current state of diagnosed cases of COVID-19 for multiple countries at once. Implications on the transmissibility and policymaking are also discussed.",

Due to 1) long lp , effectively much longer than reported for other coronaviruses, and 2) known cases of presymptomatic transmission (Woelfel et al., 2020; Tong et al., 2020) , for the modelling purposes we decided to split the latency period into two parts: 1) average latent non-infectious period ( lnip ) of 1.1 days (based on the time of infectivity for other viruses (Wallinga & Teunis, 2004) ), and 2) average presymptomatic infectious period ( pip ) of 4.5 days.

We assumed that patients with mild symptoms, in contrast to those in severe condition, are still capable of travelling. For model simplicity, we decided to merge into one compartment all mild and asymptomatic cases. We decided to set the probability of detection of a severe infection ( pDS ) to 0.6 , in order to accurately mimic two obstacles typically preventing proper diagnosis. Firstly, the majority of patients with a severe course of the disease are either chronically ill or above 60 (Zhou et al., 2020) -their symptoms might be mistaken with those caused by their general health condition, and thus not reported on time. Secondly, the model is supposed to reflect the average illness detection around the globe which includes many countries with low quality or underfinanced healthcare where the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests is limited. Another parameter of the model, pDM is the probability of being diagnosed with COVID-19 when expressing either mild symptoms or an asymptotic illness course. This parameter depends on previously defined pS and pDS , as well as the rate of total diagnosed to undiagnosed cases ( tDR ):",

This means that in our model we assume a higher proportion of undetected cases in comparison to other models proposed so far. Taking into account that none of them was capable of providing a plausible global simulation of the pandemic, plus the fact that the potential low detectability has already been discussed in the literature (Li et al., 2020) , we decided to test such a possibility in simulation by setting the lowest possible tDR .

However, following the assumption of much higher than the currently suspected rate of undiagnosed and mild/asymptomatic cases, we decided to use in our model a higher rate of transmissibility, yet well within the range of 2-5, modelled for SARS (Wallinga & Teunis, 2004) .

The model did not include any information on already implemented movement restrictions and preventive measures undertaken by different governments. As overall data on the pandemic dynamics around the globe is likely to be biased by regions, often considerable in size and population, for which official statistics might be inaccurate, we decided not to compare overall model results with global data. Instead we limited the analysis of results to thirteen countries across four continents (see Table 2 ) which are, in our belief: a) divergent in the proportion of the tested population, quality of healthcare, and strength of undertaken preventing measures; b) likely to provide the public with real data; c) reporting number of cases high enough to assume their population exchange with the rest of the world did not significantly change the pandemic dynamics. Two countries which fulfill the above criteria, were excluded from the analysis: Canada, due to its lack of coherency in reporting COVID-19 cases (as reported in https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing-source-data ); and Australia, as its geographical isolation and early overtaken precautions seem to successfully hamper the spread of the disease. The obtained 95% confidence intervals of predicted numbers of diagnosed patients were compared with empirical data. In Figure 2 we present a percentage difference over time between the number of reported confirmed cases and confidence intervals limits for modelled predictions. Positive values state that the model overestimates the number of diagnosed cases; negative values indicate the underestimations of the model; for the observed numbers of diagnosed cases that are within the model's CIs the percentage difference is equal to 0. For selected countries the model predictions fit well to the observed data, and the observed discrepancies are explained in captions to Figures 4 -16 showing results for individual countries. There are two main reasons for the discrepancies between model predictions and reported number of COVID-19 cases. The first is the fast governmental response and early introduced precautions, which significantly influence the pace of the disease spread, but are not reflected in the modelling. For such countries (e.g. Japan, the Republic of South Korea), the model overestimates the number of detected cases. The second reason is the increase of the virus detectability in countries where the proportion of tested individuals is larger, leading to higher tDR than the one assumed in our model. This is illustrated by the fact that the spread of the model accuracy between the countries is negatively proportional to the estimated number of tests performed per million citizens reported as of March 26, 2020 (see Figure 3 ). Spearman correlation coefficient calculated for the estimated number of performed tests and the average percentage difference between modelled and reported numbers of diagnosed cases is -0 . 697 (95% CI: [-0 . 92, -0.12], n=10). Figures 4 -16 confront the number of actual confirmed COVID-19 cases with confidence intervals for the modelled number of diagnosed cases. Some countries present epidemic dynamics different from the model, however, the direction of these deviations may be explained by the measures undertaken by their governments, their societal response, or the number of tests carried per million of citizens (discussed in captions to figures). We believe that further modelling efforts, including careful parameters' modifications that reflect local response, would greatly improve the accuracy of the model, but it is outside of the scope of this work.",

This would indicate that the vast majority of the COVID-19 infections are so mild that they pass unnoticed. This is not implausible, considering the fact that there are 1 . 9 billion children aged below 15 years in the world (27% of the global population) and predominantly (ca. 90%) the course of their infections is mild or asymptomatic (Dong et al., 2020) . Additionally, they gather in large groups at schools on a regular basis which facilitates further disease transmission. Also, some COVID-19 cases may show atypical symptoms (e.g. diarrhoea) (Gao, Chen & Fang, 2020) which hinders correct diagnosis. Taking all this into account, plus the results of our model, one may risk a hypothesis that the virus is already more prevalent in the global population than shown in official statistics at the moment, and consequently, its mortality rate is much lower. To verify this hypothesis further actions are required. At first, the model should be simulated with a larger number of iterations, which will narrow the obtained confidence intervals and allow further refinement of the parameters. Also, a simulation with the tDR parameter increasing over time or geographically diverse might better reflect the actual virus detectability in the course of the pandemic. Finally, the real spread of the virus should be assessed empirically by conducting a sufficient number of tests on fully random samples (currently most tests are limited to individuals with strong and typical symptoms). Only after obtaining a solid measurement of the actual prevalence of the virus, one might draw conclusions about its true mortality rate. We emphasize that our conclusions are a hypothesis based on a single computational model and without empirical verification, they may serve as a platform for further research. At this stage, by no means should they be used as a reason for governmental decisions on lifting the precautions. Even if the true mortality of the virus is indeed lower than announced by the media, many people remain in the high-risk group. Lack of population resistance facilitates their contact with the virus and may lead to a rapid increase of severe cases in a short period of time (as seen in Italy) leading to the collapse of the healthcare system, which affects the entire society and results in many additional deaths not related to the virus itself. Careful use and tuning of non-drug intervention methods, constant balancing of the disease spread and healthcare capacity, protecting the most vulnerable individuals, farsighted anticipation and agility in decision making may altogether be able to minimize the number of deaths without resulting in the global economic breakdown.",
