While the importance of behavior-change for epidemic dynamics is broadly recognized, the approaches to modeling the coupled dynamics of epidemics and behavior change have been limited. An important mode of behavior change in epidemics is a reduction in potentially infectious contacts. We develop a model for endogenous change of the effective contact rate of Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic model by positing a dynamic utility function associated with the expected number of contacts people have in the population. This utility function trades off the ideal number of social contacts with the expected cost of becoming infected. Our analysis of this simple, deterministic model reveals the existence of a non-zero endemic equilibrium, oscillatory dynamics under some parametric conditions, and complex dynamic regimes that shift under small parameter perturbations. Time-lag between current epidemic conditions and behavioral response is essential for the more exotic dynamics. These results suggest that reducing this lag may reduce both the final-size of the epidemic and the uncertainty associated with epidemic projections.",

Individuals have greater incentive to change behavior as prevalence increases; conversely they have reduced incentive as prevalence decreases [10, 11] . Endogenous behavioral response may then theoretically produce a non-zero endemic equilibrium of infection. This happens because, at low levels of prevalence, the cost of avoidance of a disease may be higher than the private benefit to the individual, even though the collective, public benefit in the long-term may be far greater. However, in epidemic response we typically think of behavior change as an exogenously-induced intervention. While guiding positive change is an important intervention, neglecting to recognize the endogeneity of behavior can lead to the reversal of those changes when they no longer appear necessary from an individual perspective. This can frustrate efforts to eradicate a disease.",

This model predicted a final size of the epidemic two orders of magnitude greater than what actually occurred [13] and this excess was due, in large measure, to behavior change. Behavior is difficult to measure, quantify, or predict [9] , in part, due to the complexity and diversity of human beings who make different choices under different circumstances.

Continuous-time modeling of epidemics and adaptive behavior generally assumes perfect instantaneous information and immediate response and does not allow for delay of information or reactions. However, in reality, information about the state of an epidemic can take time to collect and distribute, and the reaction to this information may also be delayed. For example, if behavior responds to mortality rates, there will inevitably be a lag with an average duration of of the incubation period plus the life expectancy upon becoming infected.

Finally, we assume that the utility function is symmetric around the optimal number of contacts so that increasing or decreasing contacts above or below the target contact rate respectfully yield the same reduction in utility. These assumptions allowed us to create the simplest possible model that includes adaptive behavior and time delay.

This means that oscillations and even erratic, near-chaotic dynamics and collapse in an epidemic may not necessarily be due to seasonality, complex agent-based interactions, changing or stochastic parameter values, demographic change, host immunity, or socio-cultural idiosyncracies. This dynamical behavior in number of infecteds can result from mathematical properties of a simple deterministic system with homogeneous endogenous behavior change, similar to complex population dynamics of biological organisms [40] . The mathematical consistency with population dynamics suggests a parallel in ecology, that the indifference point for human behavior functions in a similar way to a carrying capacity in ecology, below which a population will tend to grow and above which a population will tend to shrink. For example, the Ricker Equation [41] , commonly used in population dynamics to describe the growth of fish populations, exhibits similar complex dynamics and qualitative state thresholds. The existence of a non-zero, stable equilibrium in our model is consistent with economic epidemiology theory: if individuals are incentivized to change their behavior to protect themselves, they will, and they will cease to do this when they are not [10] . If we couple this with delayed information, the results can lead to limit-cycle dynamics, consis-tent with other negative feedback mechanisms with time delays [42, 43] . This is because the system is reacting to conditions that were true in the past, but not necessarily true in the present.",

Including institutional and public efforts that are incentivized to eradicate, rather than to optimize personal utility trade-offs, would alter the dynamics to look more like real-world epidemic curves. This may have a useful implication for policy. For example, beyond infectious diseases that remain endemic to society, outbreaks may also flare up once or multiple times, such as the double-peaked outbreaks of SARS in 3 countries in 2003 [44] . There may be many causes for such double-peaked outbreaks, one of which may be a lapse in behavior change after the epidemic begins to die down due to decreasing incentives, as represented in our simple theoretical model [17] . This is consistent with findings that voluntary vaccination programs suffer from decreasing incentives to participate as prevalence decreases [45, 46] .",

These parameters are very hard to measure precisely; they change depending on the disease system and context and their measurement is generally subject to large errors. To maximize the ability to predict and minimize loss of life or morbidity, outbreak response should not only seek to minimize the reproduction number, but also the length of time taken to gather and distribute information.",
