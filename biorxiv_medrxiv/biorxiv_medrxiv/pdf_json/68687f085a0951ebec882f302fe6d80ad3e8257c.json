            "text": "Over the past years, NGS has become a crucial workhorse for open-view pathogen diagnostics. Yet, long turnaround times result from using massively parallel high-throughput technologies as the analysis can only be performed after sequencing has finished. The interpretation of results can further be challenged by contaminations, clinically irrelevant sequences, and the sheer amount and complexity of the data. Results: We implemented PathoLive, a real-time diagnostics pipeline for the detection of pathogens from clinical samples hours before sequencing has finished. Based on real-time alignment with HiL-ive2, mappings are scored with respect to common contaminations, low-entropy areas, and sequences of widespread, non-pathogenic organisms. The results are visualized using an interactive taxonomic tree that provides an easily interpretable overview of the relevance of hits. For a human plasma sample that was spiked in vitro with six pathogenic viruses, all agents were clearly detected after only 40 of 200 sequencing cycles. For a real-world sample from Sudan the results correctly indicated the presence of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic Fever Virus. In a second real-world dataset from the 2019 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Wuhan, we found the presence of a SARS Coronavirus as the most relevant hit without the novel virus reference genome being included in the database. For all samples, clinically irrelevant hits were correctly de-emphasized. Our approach is valuable to obtain fast and accurate NGS-based pathogen identifications and correctly prioritize and visualize them based on their clinical significance.",

            "text": "The identification of pathogens directly from patient samples is a major clinical need. While highly accurate pathogen detection methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cell culture, or amplicon sequencing exist, such routine procedures often fail to identify the underlying cause of a patient's symptoms due to their targeted behavior (Breitwieser, et al., 2015; Bzhalava, et al., 2013; Greninger, et al., 2017; Salzberg, et al., 2016) . As a complementary approach, metagenomics Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has been proposed as a valuable technique for clinical application. NGS facilitates the detection and characterization of pathogens without a priori knowledge about candi-date species. Further, it generates a sufficient amount of data to detect even lowly abundant pathogens without targeted amplification of specified sequences allowing for hypothesis-free diagnostic analysis.",

            "text": "Regardless of the algorithmic approach, existing methods based on unbiased metagenomics NGS face various obstacles, especially concerning the ranking of the results according to their clinical relevance and the long overall turnaround time (Breitwieser, et al., 2017; Dutilh, et al., 2017; Frey, et al., 2014; Lecuit and Eloit, 2014; Lecuit and Eloit, 2015; Mokili, et al., 2012; Roux, et al., 2017; Snyder, et al., 2009) . The lack of good ranking methods is based on the fact that the distinction of clinically relevant and irrelevant data is not trivial. First, the dominating part of the sequences in a patient sample usually originates from the host genome. Second, there are nucleic acids of various species that are usually of low clinical relevance such as endogenous retroviruses (ERV) or nonpathogenic bacteria which commonly colonize a person. For these reasons, the number of reads hinting towards a relevant pathogen can be as low as a handful of individual reads. To put it more generally, it is a widespread misconception to rely only on quantitative measures when ranking the importance of candidate hits as not the amount but the uncommonness of a species in a given sample may give critical indications on its relevance. Based on the premise that a large proportion of the produced reads may stem from the host genome, species irrelevant for diagnosis, or common contaminations, even highly accurate methods struggle with false positive hits potentially concealing the relevant results. This central problem is getting worse when considering that even microbial databases are contaminated with human sequences (Breitwieser, et al., 2019) . Existing pipelines tackle this problem in different ways. One common strategy is to ignore sequences that occur in a reference database of host and contaminating sequences (Byrd, et al., 2014; Dutilh, et al., 2012; Flygare, et al., 2016; Naccache, et al., 2014; Wommack, et al., 2012; Zheng, et al., 2017) . While facilitating cleaner results, this approach may lead to a premature rejection of relevant sequences and does not solve the problem of human contaminations in reference databases as those \"derive primarily from high-copy human repeat regions, which themselves are not adequately represented in the current human reference genome\" (Breitwieser, et al., 2019) . Further, the definition of precise contamination databases proves rather difficult and has not yet been adequately solved. Thus deleting any results to gain a better overview comes at great risk of overlooking the true cause of an infection. A different strategy are intensity filters, as implemented e.g. in SLIMM (Dadi, et al., 2017) , that disregard sequences with low genome coverages. As the author states, this step eliminates many genomes which introduces the risk of losing information that might be relevant in the following diagnostic process. This problem even intensifies for marker-gene based methods such as MetaPhlAn2 (Truong, et al., 2015) , as large parts of the sequenced reads cannot be assigned due to the miniaturized reference database. While this may lead to a better ratio of seemingly relevant assigned reads to those from the background, it comes with the risk of disregarding relevant candidates.",

Even when considering the reduction of sequencing time in the last years, current mid-and high-throughput devices still have maximum runtimes of more than a day (NextSeq 550) and up to two (NovaSeq 6000) or three days (HiSeq X), respectively. The resulting turnaround times of two to four days including data processing and analysis are not short enough for many critical scenarios such as sepsis and infectious disease outbreaks. To obtain actionable results within an appropriate time frame it is crucial to reduce the time span from sample receipt to diagnosis. However, existing approaches to speed up NGS-based diagnostics come with significant disadvantages such as a highly reduced throughput and data quality (Quick, et al., 2015) , massive reduction of analyzed reads or targets (Stranneheim, et al., 2014) or the need of specialized hardware that involves additional costs and relatively low flexibility to adapt the workflow to a given scenario (Miller, et al., 2015) . An actual approach for taxonomic classification of NGS data during runtime of sequencing is implemented in LiveKraken, a real-time version of the well-known Kraken software (Tausch, et al., 2018) . However, by not providing positional information in the results, a sequence-based ranking to determine the relevance of hits is not possible with this approach.",

The currently high turnaround times from sample arrival to final diagnosis make it necessary to develop efficient methods to generate, analyze, and understand large metagenomics datasets in an accurate and quick manner to pave the way for NGS as a standard tool for clinical diagnostics. This enforces NGS-based diagnostics workflows to generate and evaluate large numbers of reads to facilitate adequate sequencing depths while reducing the time span between sample receipt and diagnosis. To overcome the named obstacles, we present PathoLive, an NGS-based real-time pathogen detection tool. We present an innovative approach to handle the occurrence of common contaminations, background data and irrelevant species in a single step. To tackle the problem of long overall turnaround times, we based our novel approach on the real-time read mapper HiLive2 that enables the analysis of sequencing data while an Illumina sequencer is still running (Loka, et al., 2019) . This enables PathoLive to perform nucleotide-level analysis based on NGS providing an open view and high accuracy in short turnaround times while generating an intuitive and interactive visualization of results that highlights organisms of high clinical significance.",

While preserving the original NCBI annotation of each sequence, additional information is appended to the sequence header. This information consists of each taxonomic identifier (TaxID), rank and name of each taxon in the lineage of an organism. Afterwards, user definable sub-databases of taxonomic clades relevant for a distinct pathogen search are automatically created. For the experiments in this manuscript, we focused on viruses. The database updater used for this purpose is available at https://gitlab.com/rki_bioinformatics/database-updater. The viral database used in this manuscript can be downloaded as a single compressed FASTA file from Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2536788) and is ready to use for viral diagnostics with PathoLive.",

This includes various sources of contamination such as sequencing artefacts, ambiguous references and clinically irrelevant species, which hinder a quick evaluation of a dataset. Defining an exhaustive set of possible contaminations is a yet unachieved goal. Furthermore, deleting such sequences carries the risk of losing relevant results. Since in this step, raw sequencing data from a human host is examined, the logical conclusion is to contrast it to comparable raw datasets instead of processed genomes. We implemented a method to define and mark all kinds of undesired signals on the basis of comparable datasets from freely available resources. For this purpose, raw data from 236 randomly selected datasets from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2015) were downloaded, assuming that a large majority of the participants in the 1000 Genomes Project were not acutely ill with an infectious disease. The full list of selected datasets is provided in the supplementary material (Section 3.3). The reads are quality trimmed using Trimmomatic (Bolger, et al., 2014) and mapped to the selected pathogen reference database using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) . Whenever a stretch of a sequence is covered once or more in a dataset from the 1000 Genomes Project, the overall background coverage of these bases is increased by one. Coverage maps of all references from the pathogen database are stored in the serialized pickle file format. Stretches of DNA found in this data are marked as of lower clinical significance and visualized as such in later steps of the workflow. The coverage maps of the background abundances are plotted in red color against the coverage maps of the reads from the patient dataset in green color on the same reference (Fig. 2) . This enables highlighting presumably relevant results without discarding other candidate pathogens, giving the researcher the best options to interpret the results in-depth but still in an efficient manner. The code for the generation of these databases is part of PathoLive.",

To improve BSL classification, minor changes were manually applied to improve matches to the organism names in the reference database. The BSL score gives information on the biological risk emanating from an organism. Therefore, it qualifies as a measure of hazardousness in this use case. The BSL-score is color-coded in green (no information/BSL1), blue (BSL2), yellow (BSL3) or red (BSL4), and the maximum hazardousness-level of a branch is propagated to the parent nodes.

We selected Clinical Pathoscope for its very sophisticated read reassignment method, which promises a highly reliable rating of candidate hits. It also is perfectly tailored to this use case. Other promising pipelines such as SURPI (Naccache, et al., 2014) or Taxonomer (Flygare, et al., 2016) were not locally installable and had to be disregarded. Bracken, a method based on metagenomics classification with Kraken (Wood and Salzberg, 2014) , was included in the benchmark as one of the fastest and best known classification tools which makes it one of the primary go-to methods for many users. The experiment is based on a real sequencing run on an Illumina HiSeq 1500 in High Output Mode. We designed an in-house generated sample in order to have a solid ground truth. We ran all tools using 40 threads, starting each at the earliest possible time point when the data was available from the sequencer in the expected input format. For the non-real-time tools, the base calling was executed via Illumina's standard tool bcl2fastq and the runtime was regarded in the overall turnaround time. Clinical Pathoscope and Bracken were both run with default parameters, apart from the multithreading. We built the databases for PathoLive and Bracken using the viral part of the NCBI RefSeq (O'Leary, et al., 2016) . For Clinical Pathoscope we downloaded the associated database from http://www.bu.edu/jlab/wpassets/databases.tar.gz using the provided viral database as foreground and the human database as background. Details of the database construction are given in the supplementary methods (Section 3.1). Please note that, in contrast to all other results shown in this manuscript, the live analysis of the in-house sample was performed using read-mapping results of HiLive, the predecessor of HiLive2. However, we repeated the analysis using HiLive2 and obtained similar results with respect to accuracy (cf. Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1) .",

Therefore, we demonstrated the performance of PathoLive on real data that is known to contain a low number of reads of interest. We analyzed a human serum sample from Sudan that was confirmed via PCR to contain Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV) but only shows a small amount of related reads in the corresponding Illumina sequencing data (45 out of 1,178,054 reads were reported by Andrusch et al. in 2018 (Andrusch, et al., 2018 to unambiguously belong to CCHFV). When running PathoLive with default parameters and having adapter trimming activated, Bunyaviridae was the family with the highest weighted score over the complete sequencing procedure when not considering phages and the \"unassigned family\" branch. Thereby, the score of Bunyaviridae was consistently equal to the score of the underlying species CCHFV while other underlying species didn't contribute to the overall score of the family. Fig. 5 shows the development over time for all families that reach a score of 500 in at least one output cycle. It can be seen that the weighted score of CCHFV (represented by the family of Bunyaviridae) is in the top three of all identified families after only 30 sequencing cycles which corresponds to 5% of the sequencing procedure. At this time point, only 16 reads were aligned to CCHFV. Thus, indications for the correct finding are already possible within a short time span and based on only a couple of available reads while the result is more and more emphasized with ongoing sequencing. The only other family reaching a score higher than 500 and not exclusively containing phages was Retroviridae, being mainly driven by the species HIV1. However, a more detailed view on the sequence level shows that all mappings to HIV1 cluster in a small region of approximately 1,000bp (Fig. 6d) while the alignments to CCHFV distribute over the complete genome (Fig.  6b,c) . This strongly indicates that CCHFV is more likely to be a true positive. Fig. 6 further shows the family level visualization of the PathoLive tree structure (Fig. 6a) and an example for Granulovirus of the Baculoviridae family that shows a high total number of mappings, but all of those being located in regions that are covered in the background database leading to a weighted score of 0 (Fig. 6e) . The overall results for this sample show the strength of PathoLive to pronounce interesting findings at first glance while still allowing for a more detailed perspective that is often important for interpretation.",

            "text": "The high turnaround time of NGS-based diagnostics is a major drawback compared to targeted molecular methods. Past efforts to speed up NGS-based diagnostics have been made but often come with significant disadvantages : Quick, et al. (2015) introduced a fast sequencing protocol for Illumina sequencers that allows obtaining results after as little as 6 hours . This speedup is accompanied by lower throughput and lower data quality, making it less suitable for whole genome shotgun sequencing approaches without a priori knowledge. Other approaches aiming at performing analyses of intermediate sequencing data require either a massive reduction of the amount of analyzed reads and/or targets (Stranneheim, et al., 2014) or the application of specialized hardware such as field-programmable gate array technology (FPGA) which is, for example, used for the DRAGEN system (Miller, et al., 2015) . Such specialized hardware approaches come with additional costs, either for purchase and infrastructure of local solutions or for the use of a cloud system. At the same time, such approaches provide a low level of flexibility in the analysis and are not algorithmically optimized for working with incomplete data. PathoLive does not require the use of specialized hardware and provides accurate diagnostics results in real-time, illustrated with an easily understandable and interactive visualization. This strongly facilitates to get insights into a clinical sample before the sequencer has finished. Real-time output before the sequencing process of the first read has finished lacks information about multiplex indices, though. Therefore, early results of multiplexed sequencing runs can only be assigned to a specific sample after sequencing of the multiplexindices. For paired-end sequencing runs, this still means analyses are still possible far before the sequencer ends, and single-end sequencing runs can produce results at the very moment the indices have been sequenced. A possible solution for this problem is to sequence the indices before the first read, which can pose addressable challenges for cluster identification. As a working solution, many sequencing devices allow paired-end sequencing with different lengths for the first and second reads. It is thereby possible to sequence only a short fragment of the first read to get early access to the multiplex indices. Thus, this approach can be used to obtain de facto single-end reads (i.e., the full second read) while having the multiplex information available from the beginning of the read.",

Besides that, there may be erroneous information in the reference databases due to sequencing artefacts, contaminations or false taxonomic assignment. The definition of the hazardousness was especially complicated, as to our knowledge no well-established solution for the automated assignment of this information exists. Therefore, the basis for our BSL-levelling approach might not be exhaustive, leading to underestimated danger levels of pathogens that are missing in the underlying BSL list. Furthermore, in-house contaminations, some of which are known to be carried over from run to run on the sequencer while others may come from the lab, could interfere with the result interpretation of a sequencing run. Especially since no indices are sequenced for the first results of PathoLive, comparably large numbers of carry-over contaminations might lead to false conclusions.
