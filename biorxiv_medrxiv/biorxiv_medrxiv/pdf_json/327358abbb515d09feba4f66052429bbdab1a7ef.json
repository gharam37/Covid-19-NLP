Fever and dry cough were still the most common symptoms in patients with COVID-19. Although there are not many cases reviewed, but the trend is similar to that reported in the literature [26, 33] . In the comparison of hematological parameters, WBC, Neu#, NLR, PLR, RDW-CV and RDW-SD in the severe group were significantly higher than that in the moderate group (P <0.05); meanwhile, Lym#, Eos#, HFC%, RBC, HGB and HCT in the severe group were significantly lower than that in the moderate group (P <0.05). Among them, WBC and Neu # are significantly higher in severe patients. It may be related to the persistent infection and prolonged hypoxia, leading to compensatory hyperplasia of the bone marrow to release more granulocytes and the results are consistent with the findings of Chen et al [27] . The significant lymphopenia in the severe group may be caused by the SARS-CoV-2 continuing to invade more lymphocytes, proliferate and cause the lymphocytes to die even to become depleted when they reach the spleen and other immune organs. The lymphopenia has been reported by many scholars [9, 11, 14, 16, [25] [26] [27] [28] . The same phenomenon was also seen in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections [29] [30] .

There was no significant difference in platelet count between the moderate and severe patients (P> 0.05). When the SARS broke out in 2003 in Guangzhou, China, it was first reported that the while blood cells count was normal or decreased (80.2%), the lymphocytes and eosinophils decreased, monocytes increased and thrombocytes decreased in some patients [22] . Similarly, a report from Hong Kong indicated that of 157 patients 153 (98%) had lymphopenia, 87 (55%) had thrombocytopenia, 77 (49%) had thrombocytosis, and 95 (61%) had hemoglobin decreased more than 20 g/L. The autopsy showed a decrease in lymphocytes in haemato-lymphoid organs, and multivariate analysis showed that old age and high concentration of LDH were independent predictors of poor prognosis. Lymphopenia and T lymphocyte subpopulation depletion may be related to the disease [23] . The results of our study are similar to the reported above [3, 26 and 27] . Lymphocytes and platelets are also important indicators for monitoring the peak viral load and immunopathological damage in the palliative treatment of lung disease with Abidol combined with lopinavir and ritonavir [24] . In this study, both the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes (NLR) and the ratio of platelets to lymphocytes (PLR) in the severe group showed significantly higher (P <0.05), and showed the best single parameter differential diagnostic efficacy (NLR AUC = 0.890, PLR AUC = 0.842). Liu et al [3] from Beijing Ditan Hospital Capital Medical University (Beijing, China) also suggested that NLR was helpful for early detection of severe COVID-19 patients nad had a high prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.849), which is consistent with the conclusion of this article. In addition, this study found that the red blood cell parameters (RBC, HGB, HCT) were significantly reduced in the severe group, while the morphological parameters (RDW-CV, RDW-SD) were significantly higher in the severe group than moderate patients, which may result from the immune damage that leads to the suppression of the bone marrow, leading to the gradual increase of anemia that causes the compensatory hyperplasia of erythroid cell line, a large number of immature red blood cells released to the peripheral blood, the activation of red blood cell apoptosis and peripheral phagocytosis, therefore result in the increase of the red blood cell distribution width [31] . In the comparison of the significantly lower than that in the moderate group (P <0.05), which is also consistent with recent reports by most scholars [11, 16, [26] [27] [28] .",

The fitting of the two different parameters by ax + by + c = w into one combined parameter has the advantages of the two parameters in specificity and sensitivity at the same time and can be more effectively used for the diagnosis and prediction of diseases. In this study, after fitting analysis of different parameters, NLR&RDW-SD combined parameter is selected as the best indicator to distinguish moderate COVID-19 patients from severe cases. The AUC is up to 0.938 and the diagnostic accuracy rate up to 85.7%. The combined parameter can help clinicians prejudge the staging of patients and take effective treatment measures in advance.",

This study found that the combined parameter of NLR&RDW-SD can be used as an indicator to distinguish moderate COVID-19 patients from severe cases. The AUC is up to 0.938, based on its optimal cut-off value (1.046), the diagnostic accuracy is up to 85.7%, and there is a good positive and negative likelihood ratio. That is to say, if the result of NLR&RDW-SD of a COVID-19 patient exceeds 1.046, it suggests that there is a greater possibility that the patient's situation is more likely to get worse or the patient is more likely to be a severe patient. If the result of NLR&RDW-SD is less than 1.046, it suggests that the patient is more likely get better or to be a moderate patient. This information will help clinicians to predict the severity and disease classification of patients, to take effective treatment measures in advance, to carry out differential treatment and to control the epidemic effectively.",
