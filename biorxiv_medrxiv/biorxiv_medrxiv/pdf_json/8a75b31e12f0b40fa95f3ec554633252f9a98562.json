As patients potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 need to visit hospitals, the incidence of nosocomial infection can be expected to be high. Therefore, a comprehensive and objective understanding of nosocomial infection is needed to guide the prevention and control of the epidemic. Methods: We searched major international and Chinese databases Medicine, Web of science, Embase, Cochrane, CBM(China Biology Medicine disc), CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) and Wanfang database)) for case series or case reports on nosocomial infections of COVID-19, SARS(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes) and MERS(Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) from their inception to March 31st, 2020.

In the early stage of the epidemic, some hospitals and staff did not have enough knowledge about the virus, leading to inadequate prevention and control measures. Suspected patients did often not take any protection measures when they went to the hospital, which may have caused nosocomial infections and hospital outbreaks(19,20). A MERS study showed routine infection-prevention policies can greatly reduce nosocomial transmission of MERS(57). According to a report by the WHO, 20% of confirmed cases of SARS were among health care workers(58). Due to the rapidly evolving outbreak and spread of the disease, medical staff need to work in a state of high tension, but they should also protect themselves adequately and take the appropriate isolation measures to avoid cross infection in the hospital. The high presence of the COVID-19 epidemic in the media is likely to improve the general public's awareness. People with symptoms indicating a SARS-CoV-2 infection should take protective measures during the hospital or clinic visit, such as wearing a mask, minimizing the time of stay in the hospital, and if possible, making remote medical consultation in advance. Medical institutions should formulate sound infection prevention and control strategies, and strengthen the hospital's infection prevention and control efforts, such as the establishment of special departments for outpatients with fever, and a sound triage system: triage of early identification among suspected cases can avoid excessive gathering of patients in the hospital. Isolation wards should be established for suspected and confirmed patients needing treatment. In hospitals without single isolation wards or negative pressure isolation, indoor ventilation measures should be taken timely, and the management of patients should be standardized in these wards. Using adequate disinfection procedures can reduce the possibility of hospital transmission of the virus. During the epidemic, efforts should be made to publicize the knowledge of infection prevention and control, be alert to the All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
