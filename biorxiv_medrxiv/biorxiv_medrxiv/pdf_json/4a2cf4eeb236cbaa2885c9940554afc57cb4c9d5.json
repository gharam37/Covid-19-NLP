Data Synthesis: Out of 1675 non-duplicate studies identified, 57 were included. Pooled mean 41 incubation period was 5.84 (99% CI: 4.83, 6.85) days. Pooled mean number of days from the 42 onset of COVID-19 symptoms to first clinical visit was 4.82 (95% CI: 3.48, 6.15), ICU admission 43 was 10.48 (95% CI: 9.80, 11.16), recovery was 17.76 (95% CI: 12.64, 22.87), and until death 44 was 15.93 (95% CI: 13.07, 18.79). Pooled probability of COVID-19-related death was 0.02 (95% 45 CI: 0.02, 0.03). 46",

Our findings suggested that the COVID-19 has an 228 incubation time of more than five days (5.84 days) and a lag of less than five days (4.82 days) 229 from onset of symptoms to first clinical visit. On average, the symptoms lasted more than 230 twenty days (17.76 days) before recovery was achieved and the mortality risk among 231 confirmed cases was 2%, which significantly increased by age. Similar to previous studies (21), 232 fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue were common symptoms among the 233 patients in the included studies. As expected, history of direct or indirect exposure to Wuhan 234 was frequent and the most common radiologic findings were bilateral consolidation and 235 pneumonia (22, 23). 236",

This finding 239 is of particular interest as uncertainties continue to exist about the incubation period of 240 COVID-19. For example, while both WHO and United States' CDC suggest an incubation period 241 of 2-14 days, single outlier cases as long as 19 (15), 24 (28) or 27 days (29) have been reported; 242 estimates that are most likely reflecting a double exposure.
