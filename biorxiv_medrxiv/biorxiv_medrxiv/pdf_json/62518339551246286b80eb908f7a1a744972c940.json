The main indicator they use for measuring the evolution of the epidemic is the daily number of deaths by COVID-19 in each country, which is a better statistic than the number of identified cases because it doesn't depend so much on the testing strategy that is in place in each country at each moment in time.",

The intensive care signal we use is not just the number of people in ICU, as this would also be biased if the healthcare system has reached saturation (in this case, biased downwards, as admissions are no longer possible when all units are in use). Instead, we estimate the daily demand of intensive care, as the sum of two components: the part that is satisfied (new ICU admissions) and the part that is not (which results in excess mortality).",

According to this data, the mortality rate among ICU patients is 50%, with the distribution of daily probabilities of death and discharge that we present in figure 1. It must be recognized, though, that there is great uncertainty around these estimates: Wei-jie Guan et al (2020), using data from 55 ICU patients in several Chinese hospitals until 29 th of January of 2020, estimates a mortality rate of 20%, whereas Fei Zhou et al (2020) estimates a mortality rate of 78% using data from 50 ICU patients from two hospitals in Wuhan before 31 st January 2020. The aggregation of all of these results would lead an estimated mortality rate of 48%, close to the one reported by Bhatraju et al (2020) , which in any case is the one we use because it includes the full distribution of times from ICU admission to death or discharge. Using this distribution and the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care, we can estimate the number of deaths coming from ICU patients, and compare this with the total number of deaths in each country to calculate, through this excess mortality, the demand for intensive care that has not been met. For this we assume that patients in need of intensive care that could not get admission into ICU will die in the following two days. Two facts allow us to confidently make this assumption: first, an extremely high mortality rate is to be expected for this group, as patients that get intensive care already face a 50% mortality rate; and second, we know this happens very fast, because in Spain, whose healthcare system has been saturated during the epidemic (as of today, 10,468 people have received intensive care and 16,353 people have died) average time from onset of symptoms to ICU admission and from onset of symptoms to death is basically identical: 8 vs 9 days, with interquartile ranges of 5-10 and 5-12 respectively 1 . Given this information, it seems like a reasonably conservative assumption.",

It is therefore a more timely indicator than the number of deaths, which has an approximate lag of 20 days. But it also adequately models the change in that information lag as the epidemic progresses and the healthcare system becomes saturated: when a higher portion of patients requiring critical care is unable to receive it, the time from contagion to death shortens. The mechanical ICU inflow-outflow model also provides information about how saturated the healthcare system is in each country.",

Additionally, the data for France only includes deaths in hospitals, as the figures for deaths in retirement homes has been published late and without the necessary detail about date of death. The figures separate the two components (met and unmet demand) and therefore show the different degrees of saturation of the healthcare systems in different countries. According to this, Italy has been able to meet a lower share of the demand for intensive care than other countries, including Spain, probably because the epidemic has been more concentrated (Lombardy represents 52% of the ICU demand in Italy, whereas the region of Madrid represents 36% of the demand in Spain). On the other extreme, results for countries such as Austria, Denmark and Norway show that they have been able to provide intensive care to almost all the COVID-19 patients that required it, in part because the epidemic reached a smaller relative size. The case of France, which has both a large epidemic and high coverage rate, is probably an artefact of the exclusion of deaths in retirement homes in the data.",

Updating the database with data available on the 12 th of April delivers an estimation of Rt <1 with 95% confidence in Italy and Switzerland, but not in the others: in most countries the estimation is inconclusive, with most of the mass of probability for Rt below 1 but some significant amount above 1 as well. Using the intensive care demand indicator allows the estimation to conclude that we have reached Rt<1 in 7 of the 9 countries considered: Italy, Spain, Austria, Denmark, France, Norway and Switzerland (but not Belgium or Sweden).
