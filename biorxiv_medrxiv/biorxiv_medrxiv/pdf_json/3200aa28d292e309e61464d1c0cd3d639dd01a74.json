A recent study of patients in China discovered an association between ABO blood type and SARS-CoV-2 infection status by comparing COVID-19 patients with the general population. Whether blood type is associated with increased COVID-19 morbidity or mortality remains unknown. We used observational healthcare data on 1559 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 (682 COV+) with known blood type in the New York Presbyterian (NYP) hospital system to assess the association between ABO+Rh blood type and SARS-CoV-2 infection status, intubation, and death. We found a higher proportion of blood group A and a lower proportion of blood group O among COV+ patients compared to COV-, though in both cases the result is significant only in Rh positive blood types. We show that the effect of blood type is not explained by risk factors we considered (age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, overweight status, and chronic cardiovascular and lung disorders).

A number of risk factors for COVID-19 infection, morbidity, and mortality are known, including age, sex, and a number of chronic conditions and laboratory findings [ 2 ] . Recently, a study on COVID-19 patients in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China discovered associations between ABO blood types and infection [ 3 ] . Their analysis compared blood groups between hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the general populations of Wuhan and Shenzhen City, as assessed by previously-published samples of healthy individuals. They found that the odds of testing positive for COVID-19 among A blood groups was increased and among O blood groups was decreased relative to the general population. Similarly, previous work has identified associations between ABO blood groups and a number of different infections or disease severity following infections, including SARS-CoV- 1 [ 4 ] , P. falciparum [ 5 ] , H. pylori [ 6 ] , Norwalk virus [ 7 ], hepatitis B virus [ 8 ] , and N. gonorrhoeae [ 9 ] .",

Third, we tested whether blood groups provide additional information on outcomes beyond risk factors by comparing the deviances of a full model (outcome ~ blood group + risk factors) to a nested model using only risk factors (outcome ~ risk factors). Fourth, we tested whether the effects of blood groups are modulated by risk factors by comparing logistic regression coefficients for blood groups between nested (outcome ~ blood group) and full (outcome ~ blood group + risk factors) logistic regression models.

Specifically, we compared models including both risk factors and blood group (outcome ~ blood group + risk factors) to those including only risk factors (outcome ~ risk factors), and we found that only the COVID-19 test result outcome (COV+ vs COV-) is significantly better explained by including blood group in addition to risk factors (p<0.02 for both ABO and ABO+Rh, Table 9 ).

Increased homogeneity would strengthen the blood-group-COVID-19 association signal as it would reduce the influence of overall population differences in blood-type distribution. We did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that SARS-CoV-2-tested individuals have a significantly different blood group distribution than the general population at NYP/CUIMC, though we cannot rule out other differences between tested and general populations that could explain the difference in associations. Moreover, our meta-analysis using COV+ vs general population found significant associations between A, B, and O blood groups, and the NYP/CUIMC data received 20-30 percent weight for each comparison, indicating a large contribution to the pooled associations.
