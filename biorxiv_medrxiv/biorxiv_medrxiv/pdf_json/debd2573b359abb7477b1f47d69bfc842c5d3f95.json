The data analysis shows that the spreading rate of COVID-19 increases similarly for all countries in its early stage, but changes as the number of TCCpM in each country grows.

The estimation of such values allows the determination of better parameters for the model, which in turn leads to more trustworthy forecasts on the pandemic development.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 outbreak is caused by a newly identified member of a large family of viruses known as coronaviruses (name deriving from the Latin word corona, meaning crown) . According to the World Health Organization (WHO) [1] this family of viruses causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). These viruses were originally transmitted from animals to people. SARS, first recognized in mid-March 2003 [2] , was transmitted from civet cats to humans, while MERS, first detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [3] , moved to humans from a type of camel. The novel coronavirus, identified by Chinese authorities on January 7 is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, as it has been named by the WHO, seems to be closely related to bat and pangolin coronaviruses, but a final confirmation has not yet been given [4] . People may catch COVID-19 by close contact with infected people, via small droplets produced when they cough, sneeze, talk, or by touching a contaminated surface and then their face. According to the WHO, symptoms of infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Notwithstanding the fact that infected patients can also be asymptomatic, in the more severe cases, the virus can lead to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death. The number of fatalities from the new coronavirus has overwhelmingly overtaken the toll of the SARS outbreak but its percentage remains considerably lower compared to the 10 percent of SARS and 30 percent of MERS.",

The TCCpM curves are not linear over long time intervals (weeks and months), but sections of it spanned over shorter periods can be approximated so. In this paper, we have chosen an interval of 5 days. By studying how the angular coefficient of these straight (called for simplicity of presentation the \u03b1 factor) changes with the number of confirmed people, we have an insight on how COVID-19 spreads over the different European countries for a given TCCpM value. In section 3, we numerically fit progressively increasing portions of the available data on the TCCpM to a mathematical model, checking how our predictions of the model's fitting parameters change with time as more data becomes available. The values of the parameters show an oscillatory behaviour which eventually reaches stability. The stable values can then be used in the model to forecast the development of the pandemic itself. Section 4 looks more closely at the Italian case by studying how the virus spread over 4 different Italian regions. Section 5 analyses the beginning of the outbreak in South America. In the final Section, we draw our conclusions.",

Spreading rate and the \u03b1 factor Fig. 1 shows the total number of confirmed cases per million residents in 10 European countries, the Chinese Province of Hubei and South Korea since day 0 (21 January) of the outbreak data. We can see that for nearly 30 days the spreading of COVID-19 is more or less confined to China, with a steep increase everyday. Around day 20 (10 February), the total number of confirmed cases in Hubei starts to stabilise to nearly 1200 TCCpM. A similar curve can be observed for South Korea. South Korea's population is of comparable size to Hubei's population, as can be seen in the table annexed to Fig. 1 , but their TCCpM curve stabilises much faster and at a much lower value, approximately 200 TCCpM. As of now, no other country studied in this work has reached a similar stabilisation. This striking difference might be due to the timely action of the South Korean authorities in adopting preventive measures to contain the outbreak, including, among others, the large number of tests performed. For example at day 48 (9 March), when both Italy, with its 9172 total confirmed cases and South Korea, with its 7478 ones, reached 150 TCCpM, see Fig. 2 , the number of tests performed in Italy (60761) was three and a half times smaller than the ones carried out in South Korea (210144). Fig. 2 gives a better idea of how the TCCpM spreading rate in the European countries changes from around day 50 up to around day 70. The time series show, for instance, that at day 48, Italy has the same TCCpM as South Korea. At day 52, Italy overtakes and Switzerland reaches South Korea. At day 64, Switzerland and Italy both overtake Hubei and, finally, after 4 days, Spain overtakes Hubei and Italy, and reaches Switzerland (overtaking it at day 72 as shown in Fig. 1 ). The complete time series can be found updated and in animated format in the website [8] .",

This give us information about how fast COVID-19 spreads with time, consequently allowing us compare the spreading rate for different countries. The \u03b2 term is the number of infected people at the beginning of the time span covered by the model. What we did then was to select five consecutive days and compute the TCCpM of each, fitting these data to a linear model from which we extract the \u03b1-factor. After this we pair this \u03b1-factor to the TCCpM calculated at the center of the time period and then move to another ensemble of five days and repeat the process. This provides us with a correlation for how fast COVID-19 spreads as more people are infected. In Fig. 3 (a) the \u03b1-factor is plotted for the 10 European countries, Hubei, and South Korea as a function of the TCCpM. The behaviour of the Hubei and South Korea's curves, clearly shows that the \u03b1 factor after reaching its maximum value goes to zero, closing the outbreak. It is also indicative that for South Korea, where the disease was soon taken at its beginning and the measures adopted timely, we found only a maximum (reproducing the well know Gaussian behaviour) while for the Hubei we find two local maxima. The double peak phenomenon is also found for the European countries. After an initial increase, the European curves start to develop in a more horizontal fashion, indicating the infection rate to approach a more linear growth. This horizontal development is not that of a constant, obviously, which would firmly indicate a linear growth, but it reveals slowing down of the spreading rate with the number of confirmed infections. For Italy, the \u03b1 factor is in its decreasing region after the double peak. Fig. 3 (b) allows a more detailed look at the \u03b1-factor from 0 to 500 TCCpM. At 500 TCCpM Switzerland starts to increase substantially compared to the other European countries. Let us understand the importance of this fact by comparing Switzerland with Italy. At the day 55 (16 March), Italy (with 27980 confirmed cases) has a TCCpM of 462.6 with an \u03b1 factor of 59.3. Italy in that moment was adopting very restrictive preventing measures. At the day 58 (19 March) Switzerland (with 4075 confirmed cases) reaches 471.7 of TCCpM with an \u03b1 factor of 116.0 almost twice greater.",

After enough days, we have a graphic representation of how the fitting parameters changed as new data became available.

Looking at Fig. 7(a) , we can see that the Italian regions have already reached a horizontal development stage, with the \u03b1-factors of Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna, and Veneto starting to drop, while Piemonte's curve is flattening out, indicating a linear growth of the spreading rate. In the same figure, we also find the curve for the rest of Italy where the maximum of \u03b1 factor is below 50, a factor five times smaller than the Lombardia maximum. In Fig. 7(b) , we find a more detailed look at the \u03b1-factor, ranging from 0 to 500 TCCpM. We can see that, after the range from 0 to 200, Piemonte and Lombardia's \u03b1-factors start to increase compared to the other Italian regions. In this case, with the same measures adopted, the difference in the future spreading rate comes from the recovered over confirmed ratio. This ratio is plotted in Fig. 8 . We can see the recovering rate increasing, specially for Lombardia, with a more than 25% recovery rate at day 72 (2 April). The Piemonte region started with a very flat and close to zero recovery rate. This means that the measures for this region were applied when the outbreak was in its initial phase. This explains why, notwithstanding the high \u03b1 factor near 500 TCCpM, Piemonte stabilises below Lombardia and Emilia-Rommagna, where the measures were taken when the outbreak was already ongoing.",

From Fig. 11 , we can see that, as the disease starts to spread in a country, its spreading rate is similar to that of any other country.

These constants can then be used in the model to simulate the development of the pandemic.

By analysing more closely the Italian case, looking at the spreading of COVID-19 in different Italian regions, we have shown how, even inside the borders of a country, epidemics may develop in different ways.

Due to the fact that after the daily peak, it is possible to have an asymmetric decrease in the number of daily confirmed cases a more real analysis should be done by using skew normal probability density functions. This will be the objective of our future investigations. Curves of the Total Confirmed Cases per Million (TCCpM) of residents for Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, Austria, Italy, Germany, France, Netherlands, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and South Korea at the 2nd of April (day 72). At the beginning of the disease, we found, for all the countries, a slow increase of the curves. After the initial period, we see a steep increase in TCCpM. For Hubei and South Korea, we also observe that the curves reach a stabilisation point after a while, indicating the decreasing number of new cases per day. The plots show that this stabilisation point has not yet been reached by the European countries at day 72. The possibility to compare the different TCCpM increasing rates for each country is one of the main subject matter of our investigation. The time series of the TCCpM for the European countries of Fig. 1 , Hubei, and South Korea are shown for different days. At day 48, Italy has the same TCCpM of South Korea, at day 52, Italy overtakes and Switzerland reaches South Korea, at day 60, many of the 10 European countries curves are located between the South Korea and Hubei ones, at day 64, Switzerland and Italy overtake Hubei, and, finally, after further 4 days, Spain overtakes Hubei and Italy and reaches Switzerland (overtaking it at day 72, see Fig. 1 ). The updated animated version of this figures is found in the website [8] . We can see that, in the range from 0 to 300, the contagion rate for the European countries is approximately the same. Reaching 500 TCCpM, it becomes evident that Switzerland and Belgium start to increase substantially compared to the other European countries.

The \u03b1-factor, representing the spreading rate of COVID-19, is plotted in (a) for Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna, Piemonte, and Veneto as a function of the TCCpM. From the plots it is clear that the four regions reached the maximum of the \u03b1-factor. The bottom figure (b) allows a more detailed look at the \u03b1-factor from 0 to 500 TCCpM. We can see that, in the range from 0 to 200, the contagion rate for the Italian regions is approximately the same. After such an initial range, it becomes evident that Piemonte and Lombardia start to increase compared to the other Italian regions. The TRCpM over TCCpM ratio is plotted for Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna, Piemonte, and Veneto. The plots help to complete the analysis of the \u03b1factor done in Fig. 8 . The plots clearly show that for a given TCCpM point, the Piemonte region has a very low ratio of recovered over confirmed cases compared to the other regions. This means that, according to our interpretation, the measuares to contain the outbreak in Piemonte was taken when it was in its initial phase.

When the curves stop varying and become constant with time, the constant values indicate the appropriate fitting parameters. The curve modelling the TCCpM and TRCpM in Hubei is plotted in (d) by using the last point in each of the top graphics.

Curves of the Total Confirmed Cases per Million (TCCpM) of residents for Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna, Piemonte, and Veneto at the 2nd of April (day 72). For the Lombardia and Emilia-Romagna curves, we clearly see an increase in the TCCpM much greater than the ones for the Piemonte and Veneto regions. As a consequence of it, keeping in mind that these four regions represent 38, 7% of the Italy population, the curve for the rest of Italy shows an almost linear behaviour. \u03a3 \u03b4 \u039b Stefano De Leo, Gabriel G.
