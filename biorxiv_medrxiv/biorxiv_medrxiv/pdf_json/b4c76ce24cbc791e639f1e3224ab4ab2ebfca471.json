At the end of March 2020, there were in excess of 800.000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide, of whom more than 12.000 from the Netherlands. Several reports suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 may suffer from a hyperinflammatory \"cytokine storm\" [2, 3] . However, unlike SARS-CoV infection, high levels of anti-inflammatory mediators (e.g. IL-10 and IL-4) have also been reported in COVID-19 [3] .",

Total number of antibodies bound per cell (mAb/cell) were quantified using a standard curve constructed with Quantibrite phycoerythrin beads (BD Biosciences). All other data were extracted from the electronic patient record. For patients who were transferred from other ICUs, patient characteristics were obtained at admission to our ICU. Data were analysed using SPSS Statistics v22 (IBM, Armonk, USA), and Graphpad Prism v8.3.0 (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, USA). All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
