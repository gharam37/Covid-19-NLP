For fast pandemics where nobody has prior immunity and everyone has immunity after recovery, the SEIQR model decouples into two nonlinear delay differential equations (DDEs) with five parameters. One parameter is set to unity by scaling time. The subcase of perfect quarantining and zero self-recovery before quarantine, with two free parameters, is examined first. The method of multiple scales yields a hyperbolic tangent solution; and a long-wave approximation yields a first order ordinary differential equation (ODE). With imperfect quarantining and nonzero self-recovery, the long-wave approximation is a second order ODE. These three approximations each capture the full outbreak, from infinitesimal initiation to final saturation. Low-dimensional dynamics in the DDEs is demonstrated using a six state non-delayed reduced order model obtained by Galerkin projection. Numerical solutions from the reduced order model match the DDE over a range of parameter choices and initial conditions. Finally, stability analysis and numerics show how correctly executed time-varying social distancing, within the present model, can cut the number of affected people by almost half. Alternatively, faster detection followed by near-certain quarantining can potentially be even more effective.",

In the classic endemic model [5] , for diseases that are active over 10-20 years, information of new births and deaths are included. In another variant of the SIR model known as the four-state MSIR [6] model, passive immunity inherited by newborns from their mothers is included: for example, newborn babies can be immune to measles for some time after their birth, but become susceptible later on. Other modifications have considered the effect of a carrier population [6] , which never recovers from the disease but is asymptomatic (relevant to, e.g., tuberculosis). Such people can again suffer from the disease later, or continue to infect others while remaining asymptomatic. In SEIR [7], a four-state model, one of the states (E) represents the exposed population, infected but non-infectious. In the SEIQR model [8] , yet another state, representing a quarantined population, is added to the SEIR model. All the models discussed above, including SIR, SIS, MSIR, SEIR, and SEIQR are governed by nonlinear differential equations. More complicated partial differential equation models that include the effect of the age structure [4] of the population and vaccination history are also available [7] .",

For a fast-spreading pandemic, we assume \u03b1 = 0 for simplicity, which makes R a slave as well, and we need to only retain the equations for S and I. Finally, by choice of units of time, we can let \u03c3 = 1. This is equivalent to nondimensionalizing \u03c4 which has units of time, as well as \u03b3 and \u03b2 which have units of 1/time.

Equations (7) and (8) make intuitive sense in a lumped-variable setting as follows. Equation (7) says that the instantaneous rate of new infections is proportional to how infectious the disease is (\u03b2), how much people are meeting each other (m(t)), how many uninfected people there are (S(t)) and how many infectious people are out in public (I(t)). Equation (8) says that the rate of change in the number of infectious people is equal to previously infected people just exiting the latency phase and entering the infectious phase, minus the rate at which people are recovering on their own, minus also the rate at which people displaying symptoms are being put into quarantine (these quarantined people are slightly diminished in number due to self-recovery, which is good; and due to some people not being quarantined, which is a system inefficiency). We are interested in near-unity initial conditions for S(\u2212\u221e) = 1 that lead to growth of the infection and eventual saturation.

Yet it may be possible to lower \u03b2 early in the outbreak, and then go back to the normal \u03b2 later, when it is safe. The benefits are illustrated using simulations in figure 8 , where the chosen \u03c4 , \u03b3 and p correspond to a critical \u03b2 = 1 (recall equation (66)). Now, suppose that normally \u03b2 = 1.04. The disease will spread, and saturate at S(\u221e) \u2248 0.92, as per equation (48). Yet, for the same \u03b2 = 1.04, a larger uninfected population of S * could be stable (equation (49)). That S * , in principle, could be reached using an artificially low \u03b2 \u2248 1.02. If we change \u03b2 from 1.04 to 1.02 early in the outbreak, and hold \u03b2 = 1.02 until a steady state is reached, then finally returning to \u03b2 = 1.04 could yield a stable solution. The outbreak would be arrested, and the total number of affected people would be cut almost in half. In figure 8 , \u03b2 is switched from 1.04 to 1.02 at two different instants T c , for two different simulations, and then switched back to 1.04 later. In each such switched case, although finally \u03b2 = 1.04, the steady value S(\u221e) corresponds to \u03b2 = 1.02. In contrast, if \u03b2 = 1.04 had been held throughout, almost twice as many people would have been infected. A further numerical study is presented in figure 9 . Here we vary both T c as well as T o , the time of switching back to \u03b2 = 1.04. The parameters of figure 8 are used except for T c and T o . We see that the percentage of people affected can be cut almost in half for sufficiently low T c provided T o is large enough. If T o is made smaller, then there is a special value of T c when S(\u221e) is highest for the chosen T o , but the gains may be suboptimal.",

It is seen that relatively small reductions in \u03c4 achieve significant reductions in the net population affected by the disease. However, if p = 0.92 (i.e., the chance of escaping quarantine is four times greater) and \u03b3 remains the same, then instability occurs at \u03c4 = 0.22 (about four times smaller), and S(\u221e) is less sensitive to \u03c4 as well (numerical examples omitted for brevity). We conclude that in circumstances where p can be kept high (i.e., if public institutions are strong and detection followed by quarantine is nearly certain), and where the self-recovery rate \u03b3 is not extremely small, the system can benefit significantly from even modest reductions in the detection time \u03c4 . In such situations, research directed toward earlier detection may yield substantial benefits, and it may even be unnecessary to engage in extreme social distancing. On the other hand, if there is under-reporting and imperfect quarantining, then impractically large reductions in \u03c4 may be needed to compensate, and strict social distancing may be more effective.

For a weakly growing outbreak that affects a small proportion of the total population, and under a further simplification that neglects self-recovery and assumes perfect quarantining, the method of multiple scales yields an analytical expression for the complete progression of the outbreak, from infinitesimal initiation to final saturation. For moderate growth rates, a long wave approximation for the same parameters provides a nonlinear first order ODE for the same progression. With imperfect quarantining and nonzero self-recovery the long wave approximation for the full progression of the outbreak is given by a second order ODE. Finally, although the underlying DDE system is technically infinite dimensional, we have shown that a six-state Galerkin-based reduced order model for the system does an excellent job of capturing a wide range of solutions, i.e., the dynamics is effectively low-dimensional.",

In the limit of weak growth, the number of infected people is cut in half. For faster growth, the reduction is a little smaller. Additionally, if the probability of an infected person being detected and quarantined is high, and the self-recovery rate not too small, then perhaps even stronger benefits can be obtained by slightly reducing the time until quarantine, \u03c4 .",

We emphasize that the benefit is not merely in lowering the rate at which people get infected, but also in the total number of people infected by the end of the outbreak. The intuitive key to understanding this reduction caused by social distancing lies in stability under fresh, but small, infection. Here, stability implies that with a small infected population, the outbreak will not grow very much (recall figure 2(a) versus 2(b)). Under identical conditions, a larger infected population could cause the outbreak to grow: the assumption is that once the infected numbers are contained, a fresh large influx of infected people will be avoided. If \u03b2 is lowered with social distancing, the outbreak saturates at a high S(\u221e), and the infected population goes to near-zero values. Subsequently, under the assumption of no subsequent large influx of infected people, \u03b2 can be increased within the stability boundary, and the outbreak does not grow significantly further.

If the average person engages in social distancing, benefits will be seen on average, although there could still be localized outbreaks within pockets where people engage in riskier behavior. In constrast, however, the speed and probability of being detected and quarantined is less up to individual members of the public, and more in the hands of public institutions. Such institutions are amenable to tighter quality measures. So, from the viewpoint of reliability, we believe that large scale testing and near-certain isolation or quarantining can be critically useful in containing pandemics like COVID-19.",
