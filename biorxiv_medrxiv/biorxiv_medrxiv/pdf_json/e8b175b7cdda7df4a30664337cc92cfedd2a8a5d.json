In particular, air velocities high 44 enough for atomization are produced when the exhaled air is forced out through some parts of the 45 respiratory tract which have been greatly narrowed. The front of the mouth is the site of narrowing 46 and the most important site for atomization; since most droplets originate at the front of the mouth, 47 the concentration of an infectious agent in the mouth (sputum) is representative of the 48 concentration in the droplets emitted during the expiratory activities (Morawska, 2006) .

In Italy, an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections was detected starting from 16 124 cases confirmed in Lombardy (a northern region of Italy) on 21 February. The Italian government 125 has issued government a decree dated 11 March 2020 concerning urgent measures to contain the 126 contagion throughout the country. This decree regulated the lockdown of the country to counteract 127 and contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by suspending retail commercial activities, with the 128 exception of the sale of food and basic necessities. It represents the starting point of a system with 129 imposed constraints.

Figure 2 shows an example of a customer 276 entering at min 26 and leaving at min 36: the risk for this 10-min exposure is 2.4% in natural 277 ventilation conditions and 1.0% in mechanical ventilation conditions. During the entire exposure 278 time of such a scenario (3 hours and 10 minutes), 179 customers (after the infected individual) enter 279 the pharmacy and each of them receive their own risk. In particular, the average risk of the 179 280 customers is 2.0% for NV conditions and 0.4% for MV conditions, then leading to a R0 (among the 281 customers) of 3.52 and 0.68, to which must be added the R0 of the five pharmacists exposed for the 282 entire period. Similar trends, not shown here graphically for the sake of brevity, were obtained for 283 all the scenarios investigated, then leading to the evaluation of the R0 for each of them as described 284",

The new regulations and methods of accessing the indoor environments that were applied in the 315 conditions after lockdown (i.e. queuing outside, limited time spent in the environments, lower 316 crowding index) were very effective; indeed, the R0 values were reduced by roughly 80%-90% (for 317 both natural and mechanical ventilation conditions) with respect to the corresponding pre-318 lockdown scenarios. 319",

To this end, we have proposed an approach 344 to estimate the quanta emission rate (expressed in quanta h -1 ) on the basis of the emitted viral load 345 from the mouth (expressed in RNA copies in mL -1 ), typically available from virologic analyses. Such 346 approach also takes into account the effect of different parameters (including inhalation rate, type 347 of respiratory activity, and activity level) on the quanta emission rate. The suitability of the findings 348 was checked and confirmed as it was able to predict the values of quanta emission rates of previous 349",
