However, most were not echoed by the patients' clinical manifestations, largely due to the lack of protein expression information of ACE2 and co-factors. Here, we incorporated the protein information to analyse the expression of ACE2, together with TMPRSS2 and Furin, two proteases assisting SARS-CoV-2 infection, at single cell level in situ, which we called protein-proofed single-cell RNA (pscRNA) profiling. Systemic analysis across 36 tissues revealed a rank list of candidate cells potentially vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. The top targets are lung AT2 cells and macrophages, then cardiomyocytes and adrenal gland stromal cells, followed by stromal cells in testis, ovary and thyroid. Whereas, the polarized kidney proximal tubule cells, liver cholangiocytes and intestinal enterocytes are less likely to be the primary SARS-CoV-2 targets as ACE2 localizes at the apical region of cells, where the viruses may not readily reach. These findings are in concert with the clinical characteristics of prominent lung symptoms, frequent heart injury, and uncommon intestinal symptoms and acute kidney injury. Together, we provide a comprehensive view on the potential SARS-CoV-2 targets by pscRNA profiling, and propose that, in addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome, attentions should also be paid to the potential injuries in cardiovascular, endocrine and reproductive systems during the treatment of COVID-19 patients.",

The spike (S) envelope glycoproteins on coronavirus are the major determinants of host cell entry. Proteolytic cleavage of S protein produces S1, the N-terminal region of S protein that is responsible for receptor binding, and S2, the trans-membrane C-terminal region of S protein that promotes membrane fusion. The cleavage step is often permissive for the fusion function of S protein as it helps to release the fusion peptide to insert into the target cellular membrane [10, 11] . Therefore, the host range and cell/tissue tropism of coronaviruses were believed to be controlled by the S protein engagement of host cell receptor, and by the proteolytic cleavage of the S protein as well [11] . Recently, works from several groups demonstrated, either bioinformatically or experimentally, that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV virus [12] , is also a functional cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 virus [6, 7, [13] [14] [15] , and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and Furin are two proteases that process SARS-CoV-2 S protein to establish efficient infection [13, 14, 16, 17] .",

Based on the profiling of ACE2 mRNA expression in different tissues/organs, multiple types of cells were proposed to be potentially targeted by SARS-CoV-2 virus, including the lung alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells [18] , nasal epithelial cells [19] , esophageal epithelial cells and intestinal enterocytes [20] , liver cholangiocytes [21] , cardiomyocytes [22] , kidney proximal tubule cells [23] , spermatogonia and Leydig/sertoli cells in testis [24] . However, unparallel to the many potential targets cells and organs proposed, the COVID-19 patients primarily displayed typical symptoms of inflammation in lung, where only a very small portion of cells (~0.64% of total cells, and ~1.4% of AT2 cells) expressed ACE2 mRNA [18] ; meanwhile, the injuries in other organs/tissues, such as kidney and the intestinal track where ACE2 RNA expressed at high levels, seemed to be uncommon [1, 25] . This obvious discrepancy suggests that mechanisms other than ACE2 mRNA levels are also involved in the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection of their target cells.",

Moreover, we also analysed the coexpression of ACE2 with its two processing proteases, TMPRSS2 and Furin, at single cell resolution in situ by pscRNA profiling. Systemic analysis of 36 human tissues/organs revealed that 1) a rank list of potential SARS-CoV-2 targets with lung AT2 cell and macrophages as the top targets, then cardiomyocytes, and stromal cells in testis, ovary, adrenal and thyroid glands. Among them, the lung macrophages, stromal cells in ovary and adrenal gland, were identified for the first time, which may account for severe clinical symptoms and rapid disease progression; 2) the mRNA levels may differ dramatically from the protein levels for ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Furin in different tissue cells; and protein subcellular localization is another factor potentially affecting virus host-entry; 3) the co-expression of ACE2 with TMPRSS2 and Furin proteases may contribute to establish efficient infection of SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

Specially, cells with higher than 72% mitochondrial genome transcript ratio in the heart dataset and cells with higher than 50% mitochondrial genome transcript ratio in the liver dataset were removed as mentioned by the corresponding authors [27, 34] . Then, the gene expression matrices were normalized and scaled. Briefly, for each cell, the expression counts for each gene were divided by the sum of counts for all genes of that cell, multiplied by a scaling factor (10, 000) and log transformed using the \"Normalize Data\" function in the R package Seurat.

Tissues highly expressing ACE2 either at mRNA level or protein level were included for analysis, in addition, the putative SARS-CoV-2 target tissues proposed by previous researches irrespective of ACE2 expression level were also included. This resulted in a list of 15 tissues in total ( Figure 2 and S2), which, based on the IHC intensity of ACE2, could be roughly categorised into 3 groups. The ACE2-high group contains kidney, stomach, small intestine, colon, gallbladder and testis. In this group of tissues, ACE2 was generally expressed at the apical region, facing the luminal surface, of epithelial cells ( Figure 2D -E, S2B-D), which means that efficient host entry of virus could only take place from the luminal side. This rule may not be applied to testis as high level of ACE2 expression was also detected in the stromal cells ( Figure 2F ), which are not polarized and could be potentially accessed by virus from the blood stream. The ACE2-low group contains liver, esophagus, breast and adipose tissue, which are unlikely the direct targets of SARS-CoV-2 virus even though some of them showed high levels of mRNA expression, such as breast ( Figure S2E ) and adipose tissues ( Figure S2F ). There is a small amount of ACE2-positive cells in the interlobular region of liver tissue ( Figure 2C ), probably the cholanggiocytes as suggested below in scRNA analysis ( Figure 4C ). These cells might be potential SARS-CoV-2 targets under the condition that viruses come from the luminal side, which is normally rare, as the ACE2 protein was detected at the cell apical surface. The ACE2-median group contains lung, heart, ovary, adrenal gland and thyroid gland. For lung, the major target of SARS-CoV-2 virus, there are considerable amount of ACE2-positive cells in alveolus lumen, which morphologically resemble macrophages and represent for the majority of ACE2-positive cells in the lung tissue ( Figure 2A ). All of the cardiomyocytes, and a portion of stromal cells in ovary, adrenal gland and thyroid gland express ACE2 very well ( Figure 2B , 2G-H, S2G), therefore are potential virus targets in the presence of viremia.",

For the ACE2-low group, TMPRSS2 and Furin are also expressed in low levels ( Figure S2A , S2E-F) with exception for liver, the hepatocytes in which express Furin in quite high level ( Figure 2C ). For the ACE2-median group, while Furin is readily detected in all the tissue cells, TMPRSS2 expression could be readily detected in lung macrophages ( Together, based on the above analysis, we propose that lung macrophages, in addition to the well-known AT2 cells, might be another direct target of SARS-CoV-2 virus. In the presence of viremia, the top vulnerable targets might be heart and adrenal gland, and then the less likely testis, ovary and thyroid gland. Other tissues are either unlikely direct targets or incompetent for establishing efficient infection due to lack of access to virus or low expression of helping proteases.",

We found the expression level of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Furin genes varied significantly across the tissues and organs analyzed ( Figure  4 ). And importantly, in certain tissues, these genes solely expressed in particular cell types. For example, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 was mainly expressed in AT2 cells, and macrophages as well though much less, in the lung ( Figure 4A) , and cholangiocytes and hepatocytes in the human liver ( Figure 4C ), which is consistent with results of previous studies [21, 42] and confirmed our above analysis on protein expression. We further investigated the mRNA expression of TMPRSS2 and Furin proteases and confirmed that these genes were also expressed in the liver cholangiocytes, and lung macrophages and AT2 cells at the high level ( Figure 4A , C). Notably, in adult human ovary, we found that merely stroma cells expressed the ACE2 and Furin gene ( Figure 3G ). In addition, the spermatogonia as the male reproductive cell moderately expressed the ACE2 genes as well as Furin and TMPRSS2 ( Figure 4F ), while the Sertoli/Leydig cells express relatively low level of TMPRSS2, which is consistent with IHC results indicated above.",

Whereas, macrophages are critical inflammatory cells that were linked to the cytokine storm [43, 44] , a severe condition leading to patient death; meanwhile, adrenal gland, via producing multiple hormones such as glucocorticoid, plays a central role in the endocrine homeostasis [45] . Therefore, it's conceivable that their infection by SARS-CoV-2 may be accountable for the rapid progression and severe conditions of COVID-19 disease. Additionally, stromal cells in reproductive system (ovary and testis) and thyroid gland were also identified as potential target cells under the condition of viremia, suggesting potential injuries in these tissues. Actually, a recent study reported a significant change in certain male sex hormones in COVID-19 male patients [46] , which is consistent with the notion that testis is potentially targeted by SARS-CoV-2.",

Instead, the injuries in ACE2-median organs such as heart are more frequent (12%-19%) [1, 47] . This obvious discrepancy suggests that mechanisms other than ACE2 expression level also play important roles in establishing efficient and successful infection. Based on our above analysis by pscRNA expression profiling, we propose that three more factors, in addition to the mRNA level, should be taken into account in predicting the vulnerability of a specified target tissue/organ. First, the protein information of expression level, subcellular localization may influence virus infection. As shown above, the mRNA level is not often corresponding to protein level, such as in kidney and adipose tissue (Figure 1) , therefore, it's necessary to not only analyse mRNA expression, but also detect protein expression in situ. Moreover, membrane proteins such as ACE2 could be expressed either all around the surface of nonpolarized stromal cells such as Leydig cells in testis ( Figure 2F and 3F) , or specifically on the apical region of polarized epithelial cells such as the enterocytes in intestinal tracts ( Figure 2E ). This means much for virus infection as it determines how the viruses may get access to their target cells and enter. For the polarized cells, virus could only successfully infect cells from the luminal side, where ACE2 is expressed on apical surface but not the basal-lateral surfaces. While for the non-polarized stromal cells, virus may readily come to see them from the blood stream.",

As for SARS-CoV-2, TMPRSS2 and Furin were demonstrated to be important proteases that cleave the S protein to promote host entry [13, 14, 16] . Threrefore, their co-expression with ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, may dictate the vulnerability of the target tissues. Actually, we found that some ACE2-high cells, such as stromal cells in testis and ovary, express TMPRSS2 at quite low levels ( Figure 2F-G) , suggesting that they may not be SARS-CoV-2 targets as susceptible as those co-expressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2/Furin proteases, such as heart though cardiomyocytes express relatively lower level of ACE2. It's conceivable that cells highly co-expressing ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Furin proteases, such as lung macrophages and stromal cells in adrenal gland, would be readily vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 attack in the presence of viruses.",

            "text": "Third, the feasible routes whereby viruses get access to their target cells are also accountable for clinical manifestations. In theory, there are two major routes for virus transmission: 1) directly entering the luminal tracks via open entries of the body. The potentially affected tissues/organs include those from the respiratory system, digestive system and urinary tract, among which the respiratory system is much easier than the rest two to be infected as it's almost a completely open system while the rest two are gated by multiple ways. This may explain the prominent symptoms in respiratory system but not in the digestive and urinary systems despite high level of co-expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Furin in epithelial cells lining along the tracts of the later two systems; 2) transmitting via blood stream to the entire body. This may theoretically affect all the internal organs with stromal cells expressing ACE2, with exception for those polarized cells in which the ACE2 protein is only expressed in the apical surface unreachable by the viruses from viremia. The target tissue cells affected by this route may include cardiomyocytes, stromal cells in adrenal gland, Leydig cells in testis, and stromal cells in ovary and thyroid gland. Among them, only the former two, but not the later three, are more likely the true or susceptible targets of SARS-CoV-2 when considering the co-expression of helping proteases with ACE2. It should be noted that the precondition for this route is viremia, which, however to our best knowledge, was not clearly documented in COVID-19 patients up to date. Nevertheless, frequent heart injuries in COVID-19 patients [1, 48] are consistent with the presence of occasional viremia. Under such circumstances, adrenal gland may be another vulnerable target of SARS-CoV-2, which, to our best knowledge, is identified for the first time in this study.",
