Wastewater surveillance may represent a complementary approach to measure the presence and even prevalence of infectious diseases when the capacity for clinical testing is limited. Moreover, aggregate, population-wide data can help inform modeling efforts. We tested wastewater collected at a major urban treatment facility in Massachusetts and found the presence of SARS-CoV-2 at high titers in the period from March 18 -25 using RT-qPCR. We then confirmed the identity of the PCR product by direct DNA sequencing. Viral titers observed were significantly higher than expected based on clinically confirmed cases in Massachusetts as of March 25. The reason for the discrepancy is not yet clear, and until further experiments are complete, these data do not necessarily indicate that clinical estimates are incorrect. Our approach is scalable and may be useful in modeling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and future outbreaks.",

Improved understanding of the presence and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level can help government and hospital officials implement appropriate policies to mitigate the exponential spread of COVID-19, and diminish the future strain on healthcare facilities. Despite pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, broad access to testing in the United States (US) has thus far been severely limited. While it is impractical to test every US resident for SARS-CoV-2, the virus has been found in the stool of confirmed COVID-19 patients (1), making it a promising candidate for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). WBE can help detect the presence of pathogens across municipalities and estimate population prevalence without individual testing, and inform public health officials of the efficacy of interventions. The closely related virus SARS-CoV was detected in wastewater from Chinese hospitals during the 2002-2003 SARS pandemic (2) , and WBE has been used for the early detection and direct mitigation of disease outbreaks in Israel, Egypt and Sweden (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . We have previously used this technique to measure and map the use of pharmaceuticals across residential communities (8) . Here, we describe an analytical technique to extract and detect genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 using wastewater collected at a treatment facility.",

We tested different steps in our viral enrichment process. First, we examined raw (unfiltered) sewage precipitated with polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG), which recovers both bacterial and viral nucleic acids. Next, we looked at samples taken from 0.2 um filtered sewage: we considered both the material collected on the filter and the filtrate.

Figure 2 shows estimated viral titer per mL of sewage at the treatment facility over seven different sample dates, with samples from two catchment areas (Southern and Northern) for each date. All four samples from before the first known US SARS-CoV-2 case were negative for virus. In contrast, all 10 samples taken in the range of March 18 -March 25 tested positive (seven out of ten samples hit all the three primers with an average Ct for all samples below 40) for virus by qPCR, using the DNA probes provided by the CDC (11) . For each positive sample, we confirmed the presence of a ~150 bp band after PCR using the S gene primers (data not shown).

While this can be tested, it may require extensive testing of individual stools in order to arrive at an accurate estimate. Given the importance of assessing the fraction of SARS-CoV-2 infections that present with symptoms, we note that our results are consistent with the idea that a significant fraction of cases that are not detected with current testing algorithms, and that this fraction may include a large number of patients without symptoms.

By integrating data on the presence or absence of viral particles across catchments of varying size within the same geographic region, it may be possible to estimate disease prevalence independent from knowing the average viral titer in infected stool. For example, if disease prevalence is 1 in 10,000, then approximately 50% of catchment areas representing ~7,000 individuals would be positive (although cases may cluster within households, so additional experiments or modeling would be needed to derive precise numbers). These experiments require sampling upstream areas in the sewage system, using specialized equipment to capture .

Methods. 24 hour composite samples of raw sewage were taken from the wastewater treatment facility influent, and pasteurized at 60C for 90 min to inactivate virus. Raw sewage was then filtered through a 0.2 um membrane (Millipore Sigma) to remove bacterial cells and debris. Filters were discarded, as initial tests revealed little to no viral RNA on filters. 4 g of Polyethylene glycol 8000 (8% w/v, Millipore Sigma) and 0.9 g NaCl (0.3 M, Millipore Sigma) was then added to 40 mL filtrate, and centrifuged at .

Once these experiments are completed in a small number of regions, they could be used to estimate disease prevalence in other regions using wastewater treatment facility data alone. Conclusions. These data demonstrate the feasibility of measuring SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. The implications of this research are that WBE can be leveraged to detect population level prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in cities across the world. In a setting where in-person testing may not be available, longitudinal analysis of wastewater can provide population-level estimates of the burden of SARS-CoV-2. These data may help inform decisions surrounding the advancement or scaleback of social distancing and quarantine efforts based on wastewater catchment-level estimations of prevalence. Additionally, wastewater collection at the municipal or community level may allow for more granular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in cities with lower COVID-19 disease burden, thereby functioning as an early warning system to help preemptively enact public health measures prior to the widespread onset of disease.",
