The SARS-CoV-2 genome includes conserved RNA elements that offer potential targets for RNA-targeting small-molecule drugs, but 3D structures of most of these elements have not been experimentally characterized. Here, we provide a dataset called 'FARFAR2-SARS-CoV-2', a collection of 3D coordinates modeled using Rosetta's FARFAR2 algorithm, including de novo models for thirteen RNA elements in SARS-CoV-2 and homology models for a fourteenth. These elements comprise SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4, SL5, putative SL6 and SL7 in the extended 5\u2032 UTR, as well as the entire extended 5\u2032 UTR; the frameshifting element (FSE) from the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a/b gene and a putative dimer of FSE; and the extended pseudoknot, hypervariable region, and the s2m of the 3\u2032 UTR, as well as the entire 3\u2032 UTR. For five of these elements (SL1, SL2, SL3, FSE, s2m), convergence of lowest predicted energy structures supports their accuracy in capturing low energy states that might be targeted for small molecule binding. To aid efforts to discover small molecule RNA binders guided by computational models, we provide a second benchmarking dataset called 'FARFAR2-Apo-Riboswitch', which consists of similarly prepared Rosetta-FARFAR2 models for RNA riboswitch aptamer regions that bind small molecules. Both datasets include up to 400 3D models for each RNA element, which may facilitate drug discovery approaches targeting dynamic ensembles of low-energy excited states of RNA molecules.",

            "text": "In advance of detailed experimental structural characterization, computational predictions for the 3D structural conformations adopted by conserved RNA elements may aid the search for RNA-targeting antivirals. Representative conformations from these RNA molecules' structural ensembles can serve as starting points for virtual screening of small-molecules drug candidates. For example, in prior work by Stelzer, et al., 6 virtual screening of a library of compounds against an ensemble of modeled RNA structures led to the de novo discovery of a set of small molecules that bound a structured element in HIV-1 (the transactivation response element, TAR) with high affinity. Such work motivates our modeling of not just a single 'native' structure but an ensemble of states for SARS-CoV-2 RNA regions. As with HIV-1 TAR, many of the SARS-CoV-2 elements are unlikely to adopt a single conformation but instead may sample conformations from a heterogeneous ensemble. Furthermore, transitions among these conformations may be implicated in the viral life cycle, as they change longrange contacts with other RNA elements or form interactions with viral and host proteins at different steps of replication, translation, and packaging. A possible therapeutic strategy is therefore to find drugs that stabilize an RNA element in a particular conformation incompatible with conformational changes and/or changing interactions with biological partners at different stages of the complete viral replication cycle. Consistent with this hypothesis, prior genetic selection and mutagenesis experiments stabilizing single folds for stem loops in the 5\u2032 UTR and the pseudoknot in the 3\u2032 UTR demonstrate that changes to these RNA elements' structural ensembles can prove lethal for viral replication. [7] [8] [9] Here, we provide de novo modeled structure ensembles for key RNA elements in the SARS-CoV-2 genome obtained from Rosetta's protocol for Fragment Assembly of RNA with Full-Atom Refinement, version 2 (FARFAR2). 10 These structures include de novo models for stem loops 1 to 7 (SL1-7) in the extended 5\u2032 UTR, the frameshifting element and its dimerized form, the 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot, and the 3\u2032 UTR hypervariable region, along with homology models of SL2 and s2m. The use of Rosetta FARFAR2 is motivated by extensive testing: FARFAR2 has been benchmarked on all community-wide RNA-Puzzle modeling challenges to date, [11] [12] [13] achieving accurate prediction of complex 3D RNA folds for ligand-binding riboswitches and aptamers, and producing models with 3-14 \u00c5 RMSD across six additional recent blind modeling challenges. 10 In addition to providing structural ensembles for SARS-CoV-2 RNA elements, we provide analogous FARFAR2 de novo and homology models for 10 riboswitch aptamers, in the hopes of providing a benchmark dataset for virtual screening approaches that make use of computational RNA models.",

Here, most secondary structures for SARS-CoV-2 RNA elements were obtained from homologies to secondary structures previously probed in related betacoronaviruses, with the exception of stem loops 6-7 in the extended 5\u2032 UTR, 4 which were generated from computational secondary structure modeling.

Prior work aiming at accurate prediction of single native crystal structures has demonstrated that convergence is a predictor for modeling accuracy, 10, 15-16 with prior tests suggesting that models that have 7.5 \u00c5 convergence or lower have mean single-structure prediction accuracy of at least 10 \u00c5, and models with 5 \u00c5 convergence or lower have single-structure prediction accuracy of at least 8 \u00c5. 10 In this work, we are however not assuming that the RNA targets form a single 'native' structure. Instead, we take this convergence measure as a proxy for whether sampling may have been adequate to generate a useful model set. As a more direct measure of the thoroughness of sampling, we also present the occupancies of each of the top 10 clusters. Conformations sampled repeatedly in independent Rosetta-FARFAR2 runs (cluster membership greater than 1) indicate some level of convergence in sampling and those conformations are more likely to be realistic low-energy structures. In Figs. 1-4 below, we show cluster members as a cloud of translucent structures behind each cluster's lowest energy conformation to visually convey the level of convergence; lack of such a cloud indicates a 'singlet' in which the cluster involves only one member.

Fig. 1 presents models for the stem loops that make up the extended 5\u00b4 UTR. Also called the 5\u2032proximal region, this region extends the 5\u00b4 UTR by ~100 residues to bracket potential structures that involve the beginning of the coding region. The assumed secondary structure depicted in Fig. 1A is largely based on previous dissection of betacoronavirus secondary structures by several groups. 2, 17 More specifically, secondary structures for SL1-5 in the 5' UTR are based on homology to prior betacoronaviruses, where these conserved stems have been confirmed through genetic experiments and sequence alignments in related betacoronaviruses. (We note for non-coronavirus researchers here that SL1, SL2, SL4, and SL5 have also been termed SLI, SLII, SLIII, and SLIV in an important set of studies. [18] [19] [20] Some of these stems have structural preferences that have proven critical to the viral life cycle based on genetic experiments in other betacoronaviruses; these preferences have the potential to be altered through the binding of small-molecule drugs. Prior genetic selection experiments have demonstrated a preference for mutations that destabilize SL1. The lower part of this stem must unpair to allow for the formation of a long-range RNA contact between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs. 9 The stem must also presumably unfold to enable cap-dependent initiation of translation by the human ribosome. The loop in SL2 has sequence features across betacoronaviruses consistent with a U-turn conformation, and mutations that disrupt this structure are not viable, leading to a loss of subgenomic RNA synthesis. 7 SL3 presents the transcription regulation sequence of the leader (TRS-L), which must be available to base-pair with TRS-B binding partners in the negative-strand viral genome to facilitate sub-genomic RNA synthesis. 21 SL4 has been shown to be functionally important, and also harbors an upstream open reading frame (uORF) across many betacoronaviruses. Here computational secondary structure modeling returned an additional stem immediately 3\u2032 of SL4, and we have modeled them together as SL4ab. SL5 is a well-established domain that, in SARS-related viruses, has a long stem elaborated with a 4-way junction; this element has been proposed to harbor packaging signals, and it harbors the AUG start codon for the genome's first gene product, the ORF1a/b polyprotein. Stems SL6 and SL7, downstream of the start codon, were modeled through computational secondary structure prediction. SL6 and SL7, computationally predicted to occur downstream of the AUG start codon, are included as potentially analogous to stems discovered to be important in bovine coronavirus but not yet established in SARS-related viruses. 22 We first produced models for the full extended 5\u2032 UTR (over 10,000 FARFAR2 models), with the topscoring structure depicted in Supplementary Figure 1 . With the current level of sampling, this and other lowest energy structures appear only once amongst our models (Table 1) , reducing any confidence that these models capture lowest energy conformations in reality. A construct of this size would require substantially more models to achieve sufficient modeling convergence. Nevertheless, the top-scoring models suggest the potential for compact RNA structures for the 5\u00b4 UTR mediated by potential tertiary contacts between stem-loops. While such tertiary contacts are of potential interest, significantly more computational power would need to be expended to have confidence that such collapsed states are well-defined low energy states and could act as therapeutic targets. We therefore turned to smaller segments of the extended 5\u00b4 UTR for which Rosetta-FARFAR2 had a reasonable prospect of achieving convergent models.",

Furthermore, the mean pairwise RMSD of 10 lowest energy cluster centers (Table 1) approached 5 \u00c5 or better, suggesting that if a single dominant structure exists for these elements, our average model accuracy would be around 8 \u00c5 RMSD or better.

            "text": "In each of these RNA elements, stereotyped configurations of apical loops are modeled by Rosetta-FARFAR2 (Figs. 1B-G). However, it is important to note that our modeling of SL2 does not recover structures with the atomic level features of the previously reported canonical CUYG tetraloop, whose structure was determined by NMR for the SARS-CoV-1 sequence 4 (Fig. 1C ). We present a homology model of SL2 based on the SARS-CoV-1 sequence as an additional cluster in our data set ( Fig. 1C , see Methods). Our de novo FARFAR2 models approach 3.1 \u00c5 RMSD to this homologydirected model, consistent with our convergence estimate above. Nevertheless, there is still an atomic level discrepancy between the NMR structure and FARFAR2 clusters. This difference likely reflects limitations in Rosetta's high-resolution energy function, with the E-gap value for the homology-directed SL2 structure over 20 R.E.U. worse than the top-scoring de novo model. The primary issue is that the Rosetta energy function assigns un-stacked base pairs, as in the C and G nucleotides of the NMR structure of the CUYG tetraloop, a substantial desolvation penalty without stacking bonuses to compensate. The fine structural discrepancy may additionally reflect limitations in Rosetta FARFAR2 sampling, which might be resolved by bringing to bear more computational expensive sampling methods like stepwise Monte Carlo (SWM). 23 The SL5 element is a long stem loop in all betacoronaviruses whose tip has been elaborated into a 4-way junction in SARS-CoV-2 and related subgroups. 2 Due to the larger size and complexity of SL5, our 3D models for this domain did not converge sufficiently, i.e., each of the top 10 lowest energy models were 'singlets' with no other conformations discovered within 5 \u00c5 RMSD among the top 400 lowest energy models (Table 1) . Nevertheless, the modeling did suggest the potential for drug-binding pockets between helices that are brought into proximity by the four-way junction ( Fig.  2A) .

To test the secondary structure of this stem-loop, we collected DMS and SHAPE data for this construct (see Methods). Secondary structure predictions from RNAstructure 24 guided by these DMS and SHAPE reactivity data (Fig. 2B ) recovered the same secondary structure developed from homology modeling to SL5 elements in other betacoronaviruses, as depicted in Fig. 1A , supporting the accuracy of this model as the dominant secondary structure. Fig. 3 presents Rosetta-FARFAR2 models for the SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting element (FSE). In SARS-CoV-1, the FSE pseudoknot structure and its dimerization domain have been shown to be critical for a (-1) ribosomal frameshifting event that leads to the production of ORF1a and ORF1b proteins from the same genomic region (Fig. 3A) . For this reason, we present models for both the monomer frameshifting element along with a dimerized system. We generated over 200,000 FARFAR2 models for the monomeric frameshifting element, with 100,000 models separately modeled with each of two similar secondary structures reported in the literature, which differ by a single base pair (Fig. 3) . 1, 25 The frameshifting element simulation reached 14 \u00c5 convergence and yielded six clusters with E-gap values below 8 R.E.U., with five of these clusters having more than one cluster member at a 5 \u00c5 RMSD clustering radius.",

The majority of variation between top models arises from different orientations of the 5\u2032 \"slippery sequence,\" which forms a weak stem-loop of variable orientation in Rosetta-FARFAR2 simulations. The convergence of the pseudoknot region excluding this 5\u00b4 slippery sequence was tighter, 8.7 \u00c5, suggesting that lowenergy conformations of this pseudoknot element are captured by the current models. Models with both of the assumed secondary structures produced low energies; they contribute to distinct but similar clusters. We additionally generated over 20,000 FARFAR2 models for the dimerized frameshifting element. Modeling of the dimerized frameshifting element did not converge on a welldefined 3D structure (each of the 10 lowest energy conformations were 'singlets' with no other conformations discovered within 5 \u00c5 RMSD; Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 2 ). Fig. 4 presents models for structured regions of the 3\u2032 UTR. The 3\u2032 UTR includes a switch-like pseudoknot element on the 5\u2032 end, a hypervariable region, and the stem-loop II-like motif (Fig. 4A ); all these regions have secondary structures built based on homology to other betacoronaviruses. 2, 17 The 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot along with its mutually exclusive stem-loop structure have suggested functional roles in viral RNA synthesis, with mutations that destabilize either the pseudoknot or the stem-loop structure proving inviable in related betacoronaviruses. 8 The structure of the stem-loop IIlike motif resembles that of an rRNA loop, leading to its proposed role in recruiting host translation machinery. 5 We generated over 10,000 models for the full 3\u00b4 UTR. Analogous to the models generated for the extended 5\u2032 UTR, this simulation was far from reaching convergence (Table 1) , but suggested the possibility of stereotyped RNA 3D structure, perhaps recognized by factors such as the virus .

We additionally generated over 20,000 models for two large subregions of the 3\u00b4 UTR, the hyper-variable region and a region including the 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot (Supplementary Figure 3) . Here we built models for the 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot based on the secondary structure forming the pseudoknot P1Pk as depicted in Fig. 4A . Future simulations of this region should also include models based on the alternative secondary structure for this switch-like element forming a stem extending P0b. In both cases, we were not able to observe convergence; none of the top 10 lowest energy conformations were similar to each other or to any of the other top 400 lowest energy conformations, as evaluated by RMSD with cutoff 5 \u00c5. This was expected: with nearly 150 nucleotides in the 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot and with the hyper-variable region having limited homology to prior structures, these two modeling cases were the largest sub-domains modeled in this report, and likely will remain challenging to model even with more computational power. Modeling of smaller sub-domains of the 3\u2032 UTR and/or acquisition and incorporation of experimental data will likely be critical to model reasonable starting ensembles for virtual docking algorithms. As a preview of such modeling, we used the crystal structure of the SARS stem-loop II-like motif (s2m) to build over 200,000 homology models for the SARS-CoV-2 s2m with FARFAR2 (Fig. 4B , see Methods). 5, 26 With near-identical sequences, the SARS s2m template crystal structure is already a near-complete model for the SARS-Cov-2 domain, such that the FARFAR2 homology models for this region are highly converged (0.21 \u00c5).",

[11] [12] [13] To guide use of FARFAR2 models for virtual screening, we have therefore collected a data set termed FARFAR2-Apo-Riboswitch, containing models of RNA elements that are known to bind small molecules, depicted in Fig. 5 . These targets include binders for diverse ligands, from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to glycine, cobalamin, 5-hydroxytryptophan, the cyclic dinucleotides c-di-AMP (the ydaO riboswitch), the alarmone nucleotide ZMP (AICAR monophosphate), glutamine, and guanidinium. Each RNA was modeled without ligands present during fragment assembly or refinement, to mimic the protocols that would be used in virtual drug screening in which modeling of apo RNA structures are used for computational docking of ligands. Three of these model sets for SAM-I, SAM-I/IV, and SAM-IV made use of homology to previous riboswitch structures' ligand binding sites (Homology, Figs. 5A-C), for historical reasons: the actual RNA-Puzzles challenges (or in the case of SAM-IV, an 'unknown RFAM' challenge for the RNA-Puzzles, involving tests based on cryoEM 27 ) were posed at times in which crystal structures of riboswitch aptamers with homologous SAM binding sites were available. These model sets should therefore serve as 'positive controls' for virtual drug screening protocols, which should unambiguously identify homology-guided SAM binding sites as good aptamers for SAM.",
