That would mean that 28 primary cases infected 66 secondary cases. Therefore, the average number of secondary cases conditional on those which infected more than one person was 2.44 (=66/27). Presumably, the 161 unlinked cases were infected by 66 hypothetical primary cases. Moreover, these hypothetical 66 cases represented infection by 27 other cases, and so on.

Results also demonstrate that if a lockdown is initiated on April 6 and if more than 60% of trips outside the home were restricted voluntarily, then collapse of medical facilities might be avoided. It is noteworthy that no law exists to enforce curfews in Japan. Therefore, a lockout would ask, not force, residents to avoid leaving their home voluntarily. Consequently, cooperation with a lockout must achieve voluntary cooperation to a great degree. Evidence related to compliance is scarce because no lockdown has been conducted in Japan to date. An exceptional study asked people about restricting movement outside the home if the government asked them to do it [18] . Results showed that 93.3% would comply voluntarily with such a government request.

It can therefore evaluate behavioral changes of individuals directly [7] [8] [9] [10] 18] . Therefore, we must use IBM for evaluation of a lockdown instead of a SIR model. No IBM exists for COVID-19 but an IBM exists for pandemic influenza. Especially, the most precise IBM, RIBM, has been developed in Japan using actual data of transportation [18, 19] . It indicated that lockdown with 60% voluntary restriction to going out can reduce prevalence by 40 percentage points for pandemic flu [19] . Therefore, it shared the same result that 60% voluntary restriction out of trips outside the home can avoid collapse of medical facilities with the present study for COVID-19.",

Therefore, the estimated degree of reporting delay consists of the term of 1/k and a constant term. Based on these results, we predict the degrees of reporting delay as 19.3 for k=1, 9.64 for k=2, 6.42 for k=3, and so on. The R 0 values were estimated as 2.86 and 95%CI [2.73, 2.97]. The protection level was estimated as 0.4 [0.2, 0.7]. Outcomes, presented as Table 2, show that the total number of patients with any symptom was estimated as 6.41 [6.48, 6.57] million. The maximum number of patients with new onset was estimated as 0.777 [0.766, 0.796] million per day at the peak. At the peak, the maximum number of the administered patients with pneumonia was estimated as 0.180 [0.180, 0.187] million per day. Moreover, the maximum number of patients who need an ICU bed and respiratory assistance was estimated as 0.496 [0.494, 0.501] million per day. Results show that 70% of ICU capacity will be exceeded on 28 [26,29] April. Finally, the total number of mortality cases would be 0.496 [0.494, 0.501] million.
