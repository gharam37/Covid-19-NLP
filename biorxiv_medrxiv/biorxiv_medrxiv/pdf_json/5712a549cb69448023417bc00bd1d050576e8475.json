However, since there is a higher risk of transmission in public transport versus private vehicles, our findings may represent decrease in mobility in an epidemiologically relevant group.",

We classified a city to have instituted social distancing measures if non-essential businesses were closed; these measures were further classified as moderate or intense based on the intensity of closure. We estimated the effect of time and social distancing measures using a multilevel mixed-effects linear regression model. We had a total of 1,025 observations across 41 cities (25 observations per city) in our dataset. The median mobility across cities on March 2, 2020 was 100% (IQR: 94%, 107%), which decreased to a median of 10% (IQR: 7%, 17%) on March 26, 2020 (Figure 1). We found that the mobility decreased on average by 3.4% (95%CI: 3.3%, 3.6%) per day from March 2 through March 26. Social distancing measures decreased the mobility by an additional 23%",
