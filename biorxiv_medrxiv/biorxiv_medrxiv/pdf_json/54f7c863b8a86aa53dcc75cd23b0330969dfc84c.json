            "text": "30 31 On March 18, 2020 the Malaysian government implemented a 14-day Movement 32 Control Order (MCO) as part of the mitigation plan in controlling the COVID-19 33 epidemic in the country. The MCO aims to limit the contact rates among the 34 population and hence prevent the surge of infected individuals. However, the trend 35 of the epidemic before and after the MCO was not apparent. By applying the 36 Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Removed (SEIR) mathematical model, we aimed 37 to forecast the trend of COVID-19 epidemic in Malaysia using data from March 17 38 to 27, 2020. Based on several predetermined assumptions, the results of the analyses 39 showed that after the implementation of the 14-day MCO from March 18 to 31, 40 2020, it is forecasted that the epidemic in Malaysia will peak approximately in the 41 end of April 2020 and will subside by about the first week of July 2020. The MCO 42 will \"flatten the epidemic curve\" but will prolong the duration of the epidemic. 43 Decision to extend the duration of the MCO should depend on the consideration of 44 socioeconomic factors as well. 45 46",

As mentioned, after the implementation of MCO the rate of contact between the 230 infected and the exposed was anticipated to be lesser than the before the MCO period. 231 The reduced rate of contact would result in a lower value for beta. A study estimated 232 that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2\u00b735 (95% CI 233 1\u00b715-4\u00b777) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on January 23, 2020, to 234 1\u00b705 (0\u00b741-2\u00b739) one week after [21] . This was a 55% decline in the value of beta. In 235 Malaysia, due to the limited movement among the population of Malaysia and the 236 nationwide travel restrictions imposed through the MCO, we forecast that the epidemic 237 after the MCO would also result in a reduction of the beta. Assuming that the reduction 238 in beta was 55% from the without MCO, as in the abovementioned study [21] we set the 239 beta value at 2.91, in the second analysis using the SEIR model.

The incubation 243 period was assumed to be Erlang distributed with mean 5\u00b72 days (SD 3\u00b77) . 244 The coefficient of migration rate (\u0263), is 1/ average recovery time. The average duration 245 between the confirmation of diagnosis to date of removal (died/discharged) for Malaysia was 246 9.7 (\u00b1 5.3) days, based on sample of 58 patients from the start of the epidemic until 247 26.3.2020.

According to a study the median time from date of onset 249 of symptoms to date of confirmation was 4.8 (\u00b1 3.0) days [22] . Therefore, the total average 250 recovery time was the sum of 9.7 and 4.8 days which was equal to 14.5 days.

While for children 394 and adolescents, stressors such as prolonged duration, fears of infection, frustration and 395 boredom, inadequate information, lack of in-person contact with classmates, friends, 396 and teachers, lack of personal space at home, and family financial loss can have more 397 profound negative effects [27] . A study showed that the mean posttraumatic stress scores 398 were four times higher in children who had been quarantined than in those who were 399 not quarantined [28]. The limitations of this forecast lie mainly in the assumptions used and because the data 411 used were from publicly available platforms. We used the data available on the day the 412 data was announced. As there was a backlog of specimens to be analyzed of about 1,000 413 .

Apart from the number of new 416 cases for each day, the nature of this data affected another parameter, namely the 417 recovery period. For the recovery period, we considered the date of removal (discharged 418 or death) and subtract that from the date of confirmation of diagnosis, instead of the 419 actual dates of the start of illness to the day of discharge or death. This calculation may 420 slightly under-estimate the duration of illness. Also, we did not consider the more 421 frequent active case detection activities which have just been started during the 422 production of this article.

Moreover, when the population is large enough these 133 kinds of randomness neutralise each other and then a simpler deterministic model turns 134 to be good enough to use. Simulation study based on deterministic compartmental model 135 is most applied in epidemiology.
