The author intents to use this model in the prediction of the Coronavirus 19 (COVID19) cases by using the daily reported data from Michigan, New York City, U.S.A and other countries. The piece wise Crow-AMSAA (CA) model fits the data very well for the infected cases and deaths at different phases while the COVID19 outbreak starting. The slope \u03b2 of the Crow-AMSAA line indicates the speed of the transmission or death rate. The 15 traditional epidemiological model is based on the exponential distribution, but the Crow-AMSAA is the Non Homogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP) which can be used to modeling the complex problem like COVID19, especially when the various mitigation strategies such as social distance, isolation and locking down were implemented by the government at different places.",

As of April 12,2020, 25 there have been about 1.8 million confirmed case, and about 116,000 reported deaths globally [3] . In U.S.A, there are about 561,159 confirm cases, and about 22,133 reported deaths [3] . In the state of Michigan, there are about 24,638 confirmed cases and about 1,487 reported death at the time author writing this paper [3] [4] . The COVID19 is affecting 210 countries and territories around the world and 2 international conveyances. The COVID19 is spreading into all 30 the 50 states, District of Columbia and its territories in United States. Because of the contagious of this disease, most of the states such as Michigan have issued the staying home order to reduce the infectious speed. The author has observed the U.S. and Michigan infected cases and deaths since March 16th. The author was curious that there must be a statistical model to predict this event. Since the Crow-AMSAA model is used for automotive warranty data by author to predict that fits the Crow-AMSAA model as well. Then the author decided to write this paper to describe what the Crow-AMSAA model is and how the analysis has been done. The Crow-AMSAA model might be useful to predict the infected cases and deaths for a pandemic like COVID19. The daily reported data from New York City [12] , Spain, Italy, France, Germany, UK, China and South Korea [3] have also been analyzed by using the piece wise Crow-AMSAA 5 model. The comparison of the speed of the transmission and death rates at different places and countries are also summarized in this paper.",

The 20 piece wise Crow-AMSAA plots are used to model the expected cumulative number of infected numbers over time, and Ln-Ln plot is to simplify the curve, and slope \u03b2 is calculated to indicate that the infectious rate is increasing or decreasing. The traditional epidemiological models is very difficult to predict the numbers of infections when the disease spreading enters to a new different phase [5] . 25 The limitation of this piece wise Crow-AMSAA method is that the manual separation of the data has to be applied to find out the different infection phase at different time period. The good fitting of the data is depending on the good data separation.",

            "text": "line, the slope \u03b2 value indicates the speed the transmission rate or death rate. The piece wise Crow-AMSAA fitting must be used in the different phases of spreading. That means the speed of the transmission rate could change according to the government interference and social distance order or other factors. Comparing the piece wise CA \u03b2 slopes (\u03b2: 1.683--0.834--0.092) in China and in U.S.A (\u03b2:5.138--10.48--5.259), the speed of transmission rate in U.S.A is 10 much higher than the infectious rate in China. From the piece wise CA plots and summary table of the CA slope \u03b2s, the COVID19 spreading has the different behavior at different places and countries where the government implemented the different policy to slow down the spreading. Ranjan [5], Canabarro, etc. [6] and Liu, etc[7] are all using the traditional epidemiological model to predict the spreading the COVID19. The author is using a novel method -Crow-AMSAA 15 which is borrowed from engineering reliability world. The Crow-AMSAA model is different from the traditional epidemiological model. The Crow-AMSAA model is the Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP)",
