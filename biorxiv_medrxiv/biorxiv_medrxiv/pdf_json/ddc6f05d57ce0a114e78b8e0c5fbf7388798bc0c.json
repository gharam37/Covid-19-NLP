An in-house pipeline (available at: 121 https://github.com/katarinabraun/SARSCoV2_passage_MS) was applied to trim out primer 122 sequences, bioinformatically deplete host reads, and generate alignment files, which contained 123 all reads mapping to the SARS-CoV-2 Madison reference genome (MT039887.1).

We previously established that this conservative cutoff 130 ensures that only bona fide mutations are considered [15, 16] . All minor variant analyses and 131 figures were completed using the Illumina SNV data as these data are higher average quality 132 and ideal for analysis involving low-frequency variants (Fig 3) . Seventy-five percent of all minor 133 variants we identify fall in ORF1a and ORF1b, which together take up 72.8% of the length of the 134 28kb coding genome. ORF1a and ORF1b encode the replicase machinery [7] . We account for 135 differences in gene size by normalizing variants to kilobase gene length (variants / kb-gene-136 length -\"v/kbgl\") [10] . The highest density of variants was reported in smaller genes like 137 envelope, ORF7a, and ORF10 (S2 Table) . We also show that through each passage, variant 138 density in ORF1a and ORF1b increases. There were no SNVs \u2265 1% in the spike gene in the 139 primary NP swab, but low-frequency SNVs (all <5%) were identified in spike following passage 140 in cell culture (Fig 3) .

Overall, genewise nucleotide diversity is very low 191 compared to other RNA viruses, consistent with low mutation rates in coronaviruses due to RNA 192 proofreading machinery [18, 19] . Genewise diversity was very low in the primary NP swab and 193 was only measurable in ORF1a (9 SNVs), ORF1b (5 SNVs) and N (1 SNV). Genewise diversity 194 is more varied in the passaged samples (Fig 5) . Interestingly, \u03c0 is highest in ORF7a in these 195 samples -although this signal seems to be primarily driven by the small size of this gene.

Especially in the setting of an acute viral 174 infection, exponential population growth can also result in an excess of low-frequency variants. 175 Population bottlenecks, for example sharp reductions in a viral population size typically 176 associated with airborne viral transmission, can contribute to an excess of intermediate-and 177 high-frequency variation. We generated site frequency spectra to expand our assessment of the 178 evolutionary pressures impacting SARS-CoV-2 viruses within humans and in cell culture. A 179 \"neutral model\" (assumes a constant population size and the absence of selection), represented 180 in light grey in Fig 4, predicts around 50% of polymorphisms will be low-frequency (1-10%). In 181 stark contrast to the neutral expectation, we observed \u2265 80% of SNVs falling into the low-182 frequency bin in the primary nasal swab sample as well as passaged samples. This dramatic 183 excess of low-frequency variation is consistent with purifying selection acting to purge new, 184 deleterious mutations. This signature is also consistent with population expansion as is 185 expected in humans following airborne transmission and in cell culture after each passage. 186 Nucleotide diversity patterns point toward mild purifying selection 187",

Parallel 225consensus-level data of clinical isolates are similarly important and allow us to predict 226 transmission patterns on a global, regional, and community-wide scale. Here, we explore 227 SARS-CoV-2 intrahost variation from a primary NP swab as well as from viruses passaged on 228 three distinct Vero cell lines. We show that while diversity is low overall, the dominant viral 229 genetic signature is one of mild purifying selection, evidenced by an excess of low-frequency 230 variants and the observation that \u03c0 N/\u03c0S < 1 in most genes across all samples evaluated. 231We show that SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences can remain stable through at least two serial 232 passages on Vero 76 cells even in the presence of a three nucleotide deletion in the region of 233 the genome encoding the poly(U)-specific endoribonuclease, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 can be 234propagated in cell culture in preparation for in vitro and in vivo studies without dramatic 235 alterations of its genotype. A recent paper by Duggal et al. illustrate the importance of viral 236 genotype instability in Zika virus (ZIKV) by describing variants enriched during cell culture 237 passage (Envelope-330L/NS1-98G), despite being attenuated in vivo and responsible for a less 238 pathogenic phenotype in mice compared to the wildtype genotype (Envelope-330V/NS1-do detect a handful of minor variants in ORF1a and ORF1b in the primary NP swab, 242 it is notable that eight out of eleven genes are clonal above the 1% frequency level. As natural 243 selection can only act upon genetic variation already existing within a population, very limited 244 intrahost genetic diversity suggests the pace of SARS-CoV-2 evolution may be primarily limited 245 by the generation of de novo variants. It is unclear at this time the degree to which limited 246 within-host viral diversity is linked to coronavirus biology -e.g. RNA proofreading capabilities, 247 homologous recombination allowing for the decoupling of deleterious \"hitchhiker\" mutations, and 248 a comparatively low mutation rate. Studies have estimated the mutation rate of coronaviruses 249 to be 2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mutations per site per round of replication, which is in line with other 250 coronaviruses [18], but lower than influenza, 7.1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 \u2212 4.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mutations per site per round 251 of replication, another respiratory RNA virus [23-27]. 252 A previous study claimed that a common deletion at nt position 23,585-23,599 (spike), 253 encoding QTQTN, arises after two passages in Vero E6 cells [12]. We did not identify similar 254 deletions in this region in any of our passaged samples, suggesting this deletion is not as 255 common as previously suggested. Interestingly, the primary NP swab obtained from the 256 Madison patient on the day of diagnosis contained an in-frame deletion at nucleotide positions 257 20,298 -20,300 (ORF1ab) that was retained through two passages on Vero 76 cells. These 258 genomic deletions highlight the importance of characterizing viral stocks by deep-sequencing so 259 genotypic differences that may alter experimental outcomes can be thoroughly documented and 260 shared with other researchers. 261 Below the consensus level, we found an excess of low-frequency variants compared to what 262 would be expected in a neutral setting with no changes in population size and no selective play. This suggests that either purifying selection is acting to remove new, mildly 264 deleterious mutations in hosts and in culture before they can reach intermediate or high 265 frequencies, and/or the virus is undergoing exponential population growth as would be expected 266 in an acute viral infection or following passage in cell culture. It is likely that viral exponential 267 population growth is contributing to this genetic signature; however, without additional samples, 268 it is difficult to determine the relative contribution of each of these factors. We would emphasize 269 these findings are rooted in relatively few, low-frequency SNVs from a single time point so 270 conclusions about the overall evolution of SARS-CoV-2 are necessarily limited. Continued deep 271 sequencing and analyses of SARS-CoV-2 minor variant SNV populations in humans and in cell 272 culture are critical. 273 274 Methods 275 Sample collection and cell culture passage conditions 276 Three different Vero cell lines were purchased from ATCC; Vero 76 (ATCC: CRL-1587), Vero 277 C1008 (ATCC: CRL-1586), Vero STAT-1 KO (ATCC: CCL-81-VHG), and were grown in 278 Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and L-279 glutamine at 37 o C with 5% CO 2 . 280 For the initial infection, the original clinical nasopharyngeal (NP) swab was divided evenly 281 between three TC25 cm 2 flasks seeded the day before with 1 x 10 6 cells per flask; one flask for 282 each Vero cell line.

A 144 synonymous SNV at nucleotide position 11,070 (ORF1a_11070_syn) was found at 15% 145 frequency in the primary NP swab as well as in all passaged samples. Amino acid positions 146 3,570 -3,859 in ORF1a are predicted to be involved in the formation of double-membraned 147 vesicles [7]. Variants at nucleotide positions 127 (nonsynonymous -asparagine to aspartic acid; 148 ORF7a_127_N43D) and 129 (synonymous; ORF7a_129_syn) were identified between 1-4% 149 frequency in all passaged samples, but were not detected in the primary NP swab. ORF7a has 150 no known function, so the impact of these SNVs is unclear [7]. These SNVs 151 (ORF1a_11070_syn, ORF7a_127_N43D, and ORF7a_129_syn) have not been identified as 152 major variants in any of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes submitted to GISAID as of 12 April, 2020. 153 Six variants identified in at least one sample evaluated here have been identified as major 154 variants in at least one sequence on Nextstrain as of 12 April, 2020. These SNVs include 155 England/20146004904/2020, and Australia/VIC164/2020; ORF1a_11409_syn (p2a Vero 76) 157 found in HongKong/HKPU2_1801/2020; ORF1b_5843_T1948I (p2a Vero 76 and p2b Vero 76) 158 found in China/IQTC02/2020; S_1640_T547I (p1 Vero 76) found in USA/WA-S17/2020; 159 S_2661_syn (p2b Vero 76) found in HongKong/HKPU1_2101/2020; and ORF3a_385_L129F 160 (p1 Vero-1 STAT KO and p1 Vero 76) found in Algeria/G0638_2264/2020. Interestingly, all six 161 of these SNVs are a cytosine to thymine transitions. 162We also determined whether SNVs were shared among the primary NP swab and passaged 163 viruses(S2 Fig).Thirteen of the 15 minor variants identified in the primary NP swab are purged 164 following passage in cell culture. Only two SNVs were found in all of the available samples -165ORF1a V1118A and the synonymous SNV at nt 11,070 in ORF1a. ORF1a V1118A remains 166 2% in all viruses. However, ORF1a 11,070-syn is found at 3% in the primary NP 167 swab and increases in frequency to 18% in p1 Vero 76, remaining above 10% in both p2 Vero 168 76 samples. Only two de novo SNVs are found above 10% in cell culture -ORF1a_10242_syn 169 (p2a Vero 76 and p2b Vero 76) and ORFb_5843_T1948I (p2b Vero 76).",
