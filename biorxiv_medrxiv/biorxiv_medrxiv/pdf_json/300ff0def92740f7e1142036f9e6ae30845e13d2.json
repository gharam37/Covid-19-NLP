The simulation, not only captures the model dynamic of the spread of the virus, but also, takes care of population and mobility data. The model is calibrated based on epidemic data and events specifically of Sultanate of Oman, which can easily be generalized. The simulation results are quite disturbing, indicating that, during a process of stringent social distancing and testing strategies, a small perturbation can lead to quite undesirable outcomes. The simulation results, although consistent in expected outcomes across changing parameters' values, also indicate a substantial mismatch with real numbers. An analysis of what can be the reason of this mismatch is also performed. Within these contradictions, for Oman, regarding the eradication of epidemic, the future is not extremely alarming.",

This curve is very close to case 2 (a) curve, Actually it crosses it at day 28. There can be two reasons of this discrepancy. First is exactly the one we did the remedy for, that is, taking care of suspected cases. Second can be the lack of data in the simulator's database itself. Simulator only has three cities of Oman. We did not notice much mobility across the populated coastal area. That can be one reason that the epidemic did prolong for only 60 days.",
