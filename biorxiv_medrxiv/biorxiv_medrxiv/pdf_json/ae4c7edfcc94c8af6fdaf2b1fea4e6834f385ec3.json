Given the need for mask reuse, we tested the feasibility of vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), ultraviolet light (UV), and ethanol decontamination strategies on N95 mask integrity and the ability to remove the infectious potential of SARS-CoV-2. FIT test data showed functional degradation by both ethanol and UV decontamination to different degrees. VHP treated masks showed no significant change in function after two treatments. We also report a single SARS-CoV-2 virucidal experiment using Vero E6 cell infection. We hope our data will guide further research for evidenced-based decisions for disposable N95 mask reuse and help protect caregivers from SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens.",

            "text": "A novel human coronavirus that is now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from Wuhan, China in December of 2019 (1) and quickly resulted in a global pandemic. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has created a high demand on personal protective equipment (PPE) and many hospitals worldwide are facing severe shortages. As transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily through respiratory droplets, procedure masks and disposable N95 masks in particular have faced severe supply shortages. In contrast to manufacturer recommendations, this unprecedented pandemic has required reuse of these masks. Indeed, many frontline health care workers have adopted individualized mask decontamination strategies with unclear effects on mask integrity and on SARS-CoV-2 decontamination efficacy. Due to more limited supply, more stringent production requirements, and requirement for critical lifesaving aerosol generating procedures N95 masks have become a special priority in our health system. This team was tasked with determining feasibility of mask decontamination within our health system. Prior studies have investigated how decontamination procedures, including ethanol, ultraviolet light, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) alter N95 mask integrity (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) , but it is unclear how effective these sterilization procedures are at destroying SARS-CoV-2. Here we investigate the effect of different decontamination methods on disposable N95 mask integrity and on removing the infectious potential of SARS-CoV-2.",

A FIT score of \u00b3100 is considered sufficient protection from aerosolized particles. Both repeated 70% ethanol exposure and extended exposure to ultraviolet light significantly impaired mask integrity as assessed by FIT scores, consistent with prior reports, although the average score remained above an acceptable functional threshold of 100 in both conditions ( Figure 1B,C) . VHP maintained an average FIT score of \u00b3100 with minimal, non-statistically significant degradation of masks components ( Figure 1D ). A single treatment of 70% ethanol noticeably impaired mask function, even when masks felt dry to the touch ( Figure  1C ). N95 mask integrity was more greatly impaired at 30 minutes than 4 hours (Supplemental Figure 1 ). Results were consistent across N95 mask subtypes for both repeated ethanol exposure (Supplemental Figure  2 ) high intensity ethanol exposure (Supplemental Figure 3) , and VHP (Supplemental Figure 4 ).",

N95 masks subsequently underwent decontamination, aside from the positive controls that were set aside. Following decontamination, N95 masks were immersed in ~3 mL of cell culture media. The media was then sterile filtered, and remaining RNA SARS-CoV-2 RNA assessed by RT-qPCR with primers designed in-house as well as CDC primers selective for SARS-CoV-2, with a total of five primer sets. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on all masks exposed to virus ( Figure 2B , Table 1 ). However, as the presence of viral RNA does not necessarily indicate viable virus, we then tested the infectious potential of any remaining viable virus exposed to each decontamination condition by applying a fraction of remaining media to Vero E6 cells. We proceeded to culture the virus with cells for 4 days before extracting media to test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by both RT-qPCR ( Figure 2C , Table 1 ) and semi-quantitative viral induced cytopathic effects (Supplemental Figure 5 ).",

We found that any ethanol exposure significantly altered mask integrity, as previously reported (7) . We also found that the impact of 70% ethanol on mask integrity appears time dependent. In fact, thirty minutes after 70% ethanol application there was even a larger decline in function, even though the N95 masks feel dry to the touch. Consistent with prior studies, we did observe a decline in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (as assessed by Vero E6 culture) after certain decontamination strategies.",

Our project was initiated to inform decision makers about strategies for mask decontamination. Due to limited resources including continued access to BSL3 laboratory space and risk of viral concentration, we were only able to complete a single SARS-CoV-2 decontamination experiment. Another limitation is that clear variation exists between N95 mask type and decontamination efficacy. This could be due to technical replicate variation. However, a reasonable hypothesis to test is that N95 masks with a fluid-resistant coating (healthcare grade) relative to the 8511 (non-healthcare grade) results in less viral .

Notably, we did not test if ethanol, UV, or VHP impaired N95 fluid-resistant coating on healthcare grade masks. Next, FIT testing, which is utilized by our healthcare system to determine N95 integrity, could in some instances underrepresent actual protection. Likewise, it is also possible ethanol or UV may have resulted in internal mask degradation, producing particulate that may have overestimated the negative impact on N95 mask integrity. While we believe our quantitative FIT testing provides a reasonable estimate of N95 mask function that can aid in comparing imperfect decontamination strategies, we did not conduct the plethora of gold-standard National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health assays required for validation. Another limitation is we did not test how time alone impacts SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.

Without access to sophisticated droplet or aerosol generating machines and to avoid unnecessary risk, SARS-CoV-2 containing media was applied directly to the mask samples with a pipette. We intended to deliver the highest challenge possible to assess decontamination efficacy. Sample from the 6 highest titer patients in our healthcare system to date were pooled, and 100uL of this concentrated SARS-CoV-2 containing media was directly infiltrated into the N95 masks with the attempt to expose the middle layer. It is hard to imagine a scenario where healthcare workers would face this degree of mask inoculum. Methods able to decontaminate N95 masks under these intense exposure conditions would likely be highly efficacious in actual practice. However, methods that appear less effective in decontaminating SARS-CoV-2 in our experiment, such as UV, would almost certainly be more effective if masks were challenged in a more realistic exposure scenario. Our data may therefore inadvertently underestimate the decontamination efficacy of some methods.",

Particles that entered the Portacount pro passed through a saturator tube, combined with ethanol vapor, and passed through a condenser tube, effectively enlarging the surface area of the particles. Droplets then passed through a laser, scattering light then quantified by a photodetector. This method allows for detection of particles of various sizes and is not limited to larger particulate. The mask operator then completed up to seven different activities wearing the disposable N95 mask, including normal breathing, deep breathing, head side-to-side, head up-and-down, bending over, jogging, and speaking. Not significant pretest variability existed between users of 3M masks (Supplemental Figure 6) . A relative ratio of ambient air particle counts to intramask particle counts was taken, with a ceiling ratio of 200 for each activity. Since few particles should penetrate the high efficiency filter of functional disposable N95 masks, any particles found inside the respirator were conservatively attributed to either face seal leakage or disruption of mask filtration components. An objective 'fit score' was then calculated by the formula FIT score = activities/[(1/FF1)+(1/FF2)\u20261/FF7). Scores of 100 or greater (two log10 reduction in particulate) is considered .

Specific real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the nucleocapsid protein, envelope protein, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 similar to that previously described (6) . 5 primer sets were used; primers previously validated to target the SARS-CoV-2 envelope and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (12) , as well as the three Centers for Disease Control primers (N1, N2, N3) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Nucleic acid extraction was performed using QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen Mini Kits (Qiagen) or NucliSENS easyMAG (Biomerieux). qPCR was performed and analyzed on a Roche z480 machine (Roche) or a Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR Instrument. Equine Arteritis Virus (EAV) was utilized as an RNA extraction control.",

The positive control was transferred to a standard 50mL sterile falcon conical and submerged in DMEM culture media. Negative controls (N95 mask strips without application of SARS-CoV-2 saliva-like solution) were treated similarly. Samples undergoing sterilization were treated similarly as above; pipette application to cover entirety of both surfaces with 70% ethanol, ultraviolet like for 30 minutes per side, VHP, or set aside for 4hrs (positive control). Conical tubes were gently agitated intermittently for 5 minutes. Samples were then subsequently transferred to Vero E6 cells via a 0.2 micron sterile filtration to test for infectivity.",
