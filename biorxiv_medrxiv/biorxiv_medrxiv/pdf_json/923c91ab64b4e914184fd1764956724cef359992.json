            "text": "For SARS-CoV structural proteins including the 154 nucleocapsid (N) and matrix (M) protein, a high degree of sequence homology (>90%AA 155 identity) suggests that their reported IFN antagonism is likely maintained in SARS-CoV-2 and 156 other SARS-like viruses. Similarly, the ORF1ab poly-protein retains high sequence identity in 157 SARS-CoV-2 and several known antagonists contained within the poly-protein (NSP1, NSP7, 158 NSP14-16) are highly conserved relative to SARS-CoV. One notable exception is the large 159 papain-like proteases, NSP3, which only 76% conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-160 2. However, SARS-CoV-2 does maintain a deubiquitinating domain thought to confer IFN 161 resistance (30). For SARS-CoV ORF3b, a 154 amino acid (AA) protein known to antagonize 162 the type I IFN responses by blocking IRF3 phosphorylation (31), sequence alignments indicates 163 that the SARS-CoV-2 equivalent ORF3b contains a premature stop codon resulting in a 164 truncated 24 AA protein. Similarly, HKU3.1-CoV also has a premature termination resulting in a 165 predicted 39 AA protein. Both WIV16-CoV and SHC014-CoV, the most closely related bat 166viruses to SARS-CoV, encode longer 114 AA truncated protein with >99% homology with 167 SARS-CoV ORF3b suggesting that IFN antagonism might be maintained in these specific group 168 2B CoV strains. In addition, SARS-CoV ORF6 has been shown to be an IFN antagonist that 169 disrupts karyopherin transportation of transcriptions factors like STAT1 (31, 32). In contrast to 170",

            "text": "179 the IFN-I sensitivity between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS-CoV. While both viruses 180 maintain similar replication in untreated Vero E6 cells, SARS-CoV-2 has a significant decrease 181 in viral protein and replication following IFN-I pretreatment. The decreased SARS-CoV-2 182 replication correlates with phosphorylation of STAT1 and augmented ISG expression largely 183 absent following SARS-CoV infection despite IFN-I pretreatment. Notably, infection of IFN 184 competent Calu3 2B4 cells also resulted in reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication relative to SARS-185 CoV. This modest reduction in viral replication corresponded to STAT1 phosphorylation in 186 SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu3 cells and indicated an inability to block type I IFN activation. the 187 sensitivity to IFN-I is distinct from the original SARS-CoV and suggests that the novel CoV has 188 distinct host interactions driving disease outcomes. Analysis of viral proteins finds SARS-CoV-2 189 has several changes that potentially impact its capacity to modulate the type I IFN response, 190 including loss of ORF3b and a short truncation of ORF6, both known as IFN-I antagonists for 191 SARS-CoV (31). Together, our results suggest SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have differences 192 in their ability to antagonize the IFN-I response once initiated and that they may have major 193 implication for COVID-19 disease and treatment. 194 With a similar genome organization and disease symptoms in humans, the SARS-CoV-2 195 outbreak has drawn insights from the closely related SARS-CoV. However, the differences in 196 sensitivity to IFN-I pretreatment illustrate a clear distinction between the two CoVs. Coupled with 197 a novel furin cleavage site (33), robust upper airway infection (8), and potential transmission 198 prior to symptomatic disease (34), the differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 could 199 prove important in disrupting the ongoing spread of COVID-19. For SARS-CoV, in vitro studies 200have consistently found that wild-type SARS-CoV is indifferent to 36). in vivo SARS-CoV studies have found that the loss of IFN-I signaling had no 202 significant impact on disease (37), suggesting that this virus is not sensitive to the antiviral 203 effects of IFN-I. However, more recent reports suggest that host genetic background may 204 majorly influence this finding (38). For SARS-CoV-2, our results suggest that IFN-I pretreatment 205produces a 3 -4 log drop in viral titer and correlates to STAT1 phosphorylation. This level of 206 sensitivity is similar to MERS-CoV and suggests that the novel CoV lacks the same capacity to 207 escape a primed IFN-I response as 40). Notably, the sensitivity to IFN-I does 208not completely ablate viral replication; unlike SARS-CoV 2'O methyl-transferase mutants(35), 209 SARS-CoV-2 is able to replicate to low, detectable levels even in the presence of IFN-I. This210 finding could help explain positive test in patients with minimal symptoms and the range of 211 disease observed. In addition, while SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to IFN-I pretreatment, both 212 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV employ effective means to disrupt virus recognition and 213 downstream signaling until late during infection (25). While SARS-CoV-2 may employ a similar 214 mechanism early during infection, STAT1 phosphorylation and reduced viral replication are 215 observed in IFN competent Calu3 indicating that the novel CoV does not as effectively block 216",
