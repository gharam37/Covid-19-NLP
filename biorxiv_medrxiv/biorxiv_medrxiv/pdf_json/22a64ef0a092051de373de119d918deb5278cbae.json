We sequentially estimated sets of model parameters (maximum number of cases K, growth rate r, and half-time t0) and the epidemic \"end time\" t95 (defined as the time when the number of cases, predicted or actual, reached 95% of the maximum). The estimates of these parameters were done for sequences of reported cases growing daily (back-casting for China and forecasting for the US). In both countries, the estimates of K grew very much in time during the exponential and nearly exponential phases making longer term forecasting not reliable. For the US, the current estimate of the maximum number of cases K is about 265,000 but it is very likely that it will grow in the future. However, running estimates of the \"end time\" t95 were in a much smaller interval for China (60 -70 days vs. the actual value of 67). For the US, the values estimated from the data sequences going back two weeks from now range from 70 to 80 days. If the behavior of the US epidemic is similar to the previous Chinese development, the number of reported cases could reach a maximum around April (2020) \"A mathematical model for simulating the transmission of Wuhan novel Coronavirus.\" bioRxiv,",

            "text": "In our previous recent work (Hermanowicz 2020) , we used a simple logistic model to analyze the evolution of data on Covid-19 cases as reported in mainland China by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (NHC 2020) . This initial analysis was done in three phases in near-real time (up to Jan. 30, Feb. 3, and Feb 6) . The analysis resulted in a sequence of continually updated forecasts of the epidemic dynamics. Although the predicted maximum numbers of cases increased as new data became available, they systematically underestimated final reported numbers (even without accounting for a major change in reporting criteria in China on February 12 resulting in a large surge of new reported cases). However, the successive predicted dynamics of the epidemic were remarkably close to the final real-world outcome. We explore this issue further in this work where we use the full reported dataset for mainland China for systematic back-casting of the epidemic. At the same time, when this work is being conducted, in the US we are experiencing a fast developing Covid-19 epidemic that in some aspects is similar to China but with a delay. We use the experience from our analysis of the situation in China to forecast further evolution of coronavirus cases in the United States. Obviously, our predictions are based on the data currently available. These predictions do not account for any possible other secondary sources of infection, changes of diagnostics or reporting, or virus mutation.",

In the US, where we are still in the substantial growth phase, the sequential estimates are indeed performed in nearreal time. In addition to three model parameters, for each day we also estimated predicted time for the epidemic to end. For this purpose. we chose arbitrarily time when the predicted number of cases reach 95% of the predicted maximum K. This time, t95 was calculated from Eq. (4) by setting P(t) = 0.95 K and is also shown in the Appendix. Figure 3 shows the development of sequential estimates of the maximum predicted cases K for China and Figure 4 presents the corresponding \"ending times\" t95. As reported earlier (Hermanowicz 2020) for actual near-real time analysis, estimates of predicted maximum cases K depended very heavily on the length of the dataset used for estimation. As examples, Figure 5 shows a few logistic curves corresponding to selected model parameter estimates on specific days for China. As seen in this figure, the initial estimates (close to the exponential phase) were below 20,000 but they grew to about 100,000 as more data became available and was used for estimate refinement. Obviously, the estimate of K obtained from the full dataset (up to day 87) matches closely the actual reported number of cases (80,780 vs. 80,807) but it should be noted that the estimates of K from day 65 (more than 20 days in advance) converged very closely to the actual maximum.
