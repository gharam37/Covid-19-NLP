Here we show, using a microsimulation model, that how to reopen safely depends on what percentage of COVID-19 cases can be detected by testing. The higher the detection rate, the less restrictive the reopen plan needs to be. If 70% of cases can be detected, schools and businesses can reopen if 2-layer quarantine is imposed on each confirmed case. Our results suggest that increasing the detection rate is essential to prevent the resurgence of COVID-19.",

The model has a timeline similar to the COVID-19 outbreak in Massachusetts (Fig. S3) . Patient 0 was introduced on February 26 at a company conference; K-12 schools and colleges were closed on March 14; non-essential works were shut down on March 22. To test this model, we first compared the number of simulated cases to reported cases. Because the latter depends on testing availability and turnaround time, it sets a lower bound of actual cases approximately one week before the report date (Fig. S4 ). Reported death, in comparison, provides a more realistic estimate of actual cases 1-2 weeks before the report date (Fig. S5 ). Here we assumed the death rate is ~1% as reported in Korea, where extensive testing started early in the outbreak. Third, our model predicts a peak date of reported cases on April 24 (Fig. S6 ). In comparison, the University of Washington model (covid19.healthdata.org) predicts a peak date of resource use on April 28 (Fig. S7) . Fourth, our model predicts a total death of 9,106 by August 5th, 11% more than the University of Washington model (Fig. S7) . Fifth, our model predicts a serial interval of 5.04 +/-0.04 days, consistent with the reported interval of 4.4-7.5 days 4 . Last, our model predicts a reproduction number of 5.96 +/-0.18. This number is higher than SARS 6, 7 and the COVID-19 estimate 4 based on the early outbreak in Wuhan, where testing was limited.",
