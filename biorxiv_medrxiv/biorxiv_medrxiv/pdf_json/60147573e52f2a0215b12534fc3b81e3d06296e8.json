A range of intersecting biological, demographic, and socioeconomic factors are likely to determine an individual's susceptibility to COVID-19. These factors vary significantly across counties in the United States, and often reflect the structural inequities in our society. Recognizing this vast inter-county variation in risks will be critical to mounting an adequate response strategy.",

Both the federal and state governments will benefit from recognizing high intra-state, inter-county variation in population risks and response capacity. Many of the factors that are likely to exacerbate the burden of COVID-19 and the demand on healthcare systems are the compounded result of long-standing structural inequalities in US society. Strategies to protect those in the most vulnerable counties will require urgent measures to better support communities' attempts at social distancing and to accelerate cooperation across jurisdictions to supply personnel and equipment to counties that will experience high demand.",

Researchers have noted geographic disparities in critical medical resources, such as ventilators, hospital beds, and intensive care unit beds (1) (2) (3) (4) , which are important determinants of COVID-19 survival. Preliminary data from the epidemic in the US is exposing a convergence of demographic and socioeconomic issues that make low-income communities and people of color more vulnerable than others. Reports from Detroit, Milwaukee, New Orleans, and Chicago suggest that blacks comprise a disproportionate proportion of COVID-19 cases and deaths relative to their share of the population (5, 6) .",

Communities of color do not only have increased risk of chronic diseases (40) , which increase risk of COVID-19 infection, but also experience unequal access to health care (5, 41) . Populations of color are also disproportionately unemployed (42), incarcerated (43) , and without health insurance (14) -all independent risks, as we have discussed above. These disparities contribute to higher age-adjusted death rates among non-Hispanic blacks relative to non-Hispanic whites (44) , Even within levels of chronological age, groups subjected to economic and social deprivation have a higher risk of comorbidities and premature mortality compared to people who are chronologically older but more privileged (45, 46) .

Many Americans with chronic comorbidities, lack (and recent loss) of health insurance, inability to work from home, and poor access to care, are likely to be disproportionately affected by COVID-19, due to their increased risk of both infection and severe disease. The majority of counties that carry these multiple burdens, however, are also located in states that have been tepid in their social-distancing response (49) .
