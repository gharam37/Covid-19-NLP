There is no true value for R 0 as it varies in different parts of the UK (and the world). In particular, in rural areas one would expect a considerably lower value of R 0 than in London. Authors of [3] suggest R 0 = 2.2 and R 0 = 2.4 as typical; the authors of [4] use values for R 0 in the range [2.25, 2.75]. We shall use the value R 0 = 2.5 as typical, which, in view of the recent data, looks to be a rather high (pessimistic) choice overall. However, R 0 = 2.5 seems to be an adequate choice for the mega-cities where the epidemics develop faster and may lead to more causalities. In rural areas, in small towns, and everywhere else where social contacts are less intense, the epidemic is milder. The flow-chart in Figure 1 describes the process of illness. We assume that the person becomes infected \u03c4 I days after catching the virus, where \u03c4 I has Poisson distribution with mean of \u03bb I days.

Taking into account the fact that infected people from G would on average require more hospital beds than the rest of population, the expected number of hospital beds required for the whole population stays approximately the same during the whole epidemic which has to be almost over in July. Figure 9 , showing expected deaths numbers for both scenarios with t 2 = April 13 and t 2 = April 22, show similar patterns concluding that there is very little gain in keeping the lock-down, especially taking into account huge economic loss caused by every extra day of the lock-down [10]. Overall, the total expected death is higher but the difference can be considered as very small.

It is clear that the value of c measures the degree of isolation of people from G and has negligible effect on the rest of population; this is clearly seen in both figures. On the other hand, the value of c has very significant effect on the people from G. Consider first Figure 10 giving proportions of infected people. One can clearly see that the purple line (group G, c = 0.25) is much lower that the solid red line (group G, c = 1) for all the time until the end of the epidemic, from May until August.

The fact that the difference is significant is related to the larger number of death for x = 0.8 in the initial period of the epidemic.

Similarly, in Figure 15 the red and blue colours show the expected numbers of deaths in these two groups. Figures 14 and 15 show that the timing of the lock-down has serious effect on the development of the epidemic. Late call for a lock-down (when x = 0.8) helps to slow down the epidemic and guarantees its fast smooth decrease but does not safe as many people as, for example, the call with x = 0.9.",

This can be explained by observing that, even after 2 months of an epidemic with large x, even with lock-down and strong isolation of the group G and relatively small reproductive number (recall R 2 = 2), there is still a very large proportion of non-immune people available for the virus; a large part of these people is going to be infected even with smaller reproductive number. This prolongs the epidemics. Expected deaths toll for x = 0.95 is 13.8(5.5+8.3)K and for x = 0.97 it is 13.4(5.7+7.7)K. These numbers are naturally lower than 15(5.2+9.8)K for x = 0.9 but the difference is not significant. Figures 16-19 and the discussion above imply the following conclusion. Conclusion. A lock-down at an early stage of an epidemic (unless it is a very strict one like in Wuhan) is not a sensible decision in view of the economic consequences of the lock-down and the measures required for all the remaining (much longer) period of the epidemic. Moreover, in the case of an early lock-down, the second wave of the epidemic should be expected with a peak at around 2 months after the first one. In Figures 18 and 19 , we use x = 0.97 and x = 0.9. Expected deaths toll for x = 0.97 is 13.8(5.7+8.3)K. This is naturally lower than 15(5.2+9.8)K for x = 0.9. This is related to the fact that we isolate people from group G much earlier.",
