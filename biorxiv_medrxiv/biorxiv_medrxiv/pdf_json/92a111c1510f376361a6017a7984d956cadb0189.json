            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is one of the biggest challenges healthcare systems worldwide have ever had to face. To curb transmission many countries have adopted social distancing measures and travel restrictions. Estimating the effect of these measures in each context is challenging and requires mathematical models of the transmission dynamics. Projections for the future course of the epidemic strongly rely on model predictions and accurate representation of real-time data as they accumulate. Here I develop an SEIR modeling framework for Covid-19, to evaluate reported cases and fatalities, and to enable forecasting using evidence-based Bayesian parameter estimation. This Bayesian framework offers a tool to parametrize real-time dynamics of Covid-19 cases, and explore the effect of control as it unfolds in any setting. I apply the model to Covid-19 data from Albania, where drastic control measures were put in place already on the day of the first confirmed case. Evaluating the dynamics of reported cases 9-31 March 2020, I estimate parameters and make preliminary projections. Three weeks into the measures, Albanian data already indicate a strong signature of more than 40% transmission reduction, and lend support to a progressively increasing effect of control measures rather than a static one. In the Albanian setting, the model and data match well, projecting the peak of the outbreak may be around 5-15 April, and be contained within 300 active confirmed cases if control continues with the same trend. This framework can be used to understand the quantitative effects of different control measures in real-time, and inform adaptive intervention for success in other settings.",

Given very close travel connections with Italy, where the epidemic grew very fast over the month of February, the concern over a major similar outbreak in Albania was significant. Immediately following the first case confirmation, country-wide measures were taken to drastically reduce transmission and contain the spread of infection. These included university and school closures, suspension of public gatherings, closure of bars and cafes, travel restrictions, and gradually a lockdown of the population. The parameters governing the epidemic course of COVID-19 in Albania remain unknown. The first week after the first detected case, official numbers indicated case counts amounting to a total 59 confirmed cases on March 18, with two fatalities (Albanian Institute of Public Health). The initial exponential growth rate of the number of cases in Albania was r = 0.17 during the first week, coming from a doubling time of 4 days (1), but this has slowed down from March 14 onward. It is not known what will be the trajectory of the epidemic in this country. Following the diagnosis of the first cases, the borders with Italy, Greece, Kosovo were rapidly closed and many flights to other European destinations were limited or cancelled.",

The incubation time from exposure to infection, informing the progression rate \u03c4 , has been shown to be around 6.5 days (median), and up to 14 days (8) . Exposed individuals are assumed to not be infectious. After progressing to infection, a fraction of individuals are symptomatic given by \u03c6, and 1 \u2212 \u03c6 are asymptomatic. The duration of infection from infected people in Wuhan has been observed to be around 11 days (7) , motivating my assumption of \u03b3 = 1/11 in the model, but larger and lower values have also been reported such as 20-30 days infectious period (9; 6) and 3.48 days (3) .

The magnitude of the number of active confirmed cases at the peak will be around 302 with 50% CI(242,498) and 95%CI(180,1.1 \u00d7 10 5 ), thus still with substantial uncertainty. The total number of Covid-19 cases, including those documented/confirmed and those not-confirmed (asymptomatic) will be 1903 with 50%CI (1386,3674) and 95% CI (930, 5.4 \u00d7 10 5 ). While all these predictions are to be taken with caution, since we don't have yet a clear final signature of drop in cases, they indicate some reason for optimism in the possibilities of limited epidemic size of SARS-Cov2 in Albania. If the effect of control measures continues with this trend, the epidemic projections for Albania suggested by the model appear manageable. Under constant control instead, the data suggest that current efforts have reduced transmission by 40% (see Table 2 ), but if this remains at this level, it is not sufficient to limit the number of cases in the short term (see Supplementary Figures S1-S3 ).",

In the case of Albanian data, adding the case observations for the next 3 days (March 29-31), narrows dramatically the credible intervals of the future course of the epidemic (see Figure 5 ) with little change in the posterior parameter estimates ( Figure S4 ). The model-predictions for the quantitative aspects of the epidemic are also narrowed substantially ( Figure S5 ). In particular, the peak of the outbreak is expected to occur between 5-15 April (Fig.S5C) , and not surpass 300 active confirmed cases (Fig.S5B) , if control continues with this trend. Comparing the model fits to data March 9-31 for the dynamic control and constant control model, we observe a smaller error for the dynamic control than the constant control model ( Figure 6 ). This is further confirmed from analysis of the deviance information criterion DIC (14) , where we find that DIC dynamic = 4447 for the dynamic model, and DIC constant = 27283 for the constant model. Typically models with smaller DIC are favoured. Thus, the data strongly suggest that the effect of control measures on transmission in Albania has been dynamic, increasing over time.",

An R 0 so high, of the order of 5, estimated by the early dynamics of confirmed cases in Albania, may be related to superspreaders having dominated the early transmission events in the epidemic in this country, or related to big public gatherings and festivities at national level (political meetings, International Women's day, etc.) just preceding the first confirmed case. Other studies have also shown that mean R 0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) (15) , and is very sensitive to the reporting rate. If the reporting rate is increased by 8-fold, the estimate is expected to approach the more widely agreed values in the literature (2; 3) . So far the model does not take into account reporting rate, but it is likely that Covid-19 cases in Albania may be under-reported, due to the low number of overall tests performed, compared to the total population size.",
