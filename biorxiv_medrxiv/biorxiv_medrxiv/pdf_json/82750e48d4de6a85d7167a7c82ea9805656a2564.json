In both children, the symptoms on admission were alleviated, although in one of them only partly (52).

Our results are compared with published systematic reviews of glucocorticoid therapy for severe pneumonia.

A meta-analysis of SARS in 2017 showed that the incidence of osteonecrosis increased with the dosing of systemic glucocorticoids, and the summary RR of osteonecrosis was 1.57 (95% CI 1.30-1.89) (56). As retrospective studies have shown that the glucocorticoids were given for 19% to 26% of patients with COVID-19 (and to 45% of patients with severe disease), there is a high risk that this therapy is currently misused (57-59). In summary, the current research evidence does not support the routine use of systemic glucocorticoids for patients with COVID-19.
