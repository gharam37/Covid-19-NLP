Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. Data sources: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus and PsycINFO were searched using the strategy: (Coronavirus OR Coronavirus Infections OR COVID OR SARS virus OR Severe acute respiratory syndrome OR MERS OR Middle east respiratory syndrome) AND (Follow-up OR Follow-up studies OR Prevalence). Original studies reporting the clinical outcomes of adult survivors of coronavirus outbreaks two months after discharge or three months after admission were included. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2009 Level of Evidence Tool. Meta-analysis was conducted to derive pooled estimates of prevalence and severity for different outcomes at time points up to 6 months follow-up and beyond 6 months follow-up. Results: The search yielded 1169 studies of which 28 were included in this review. There were 15 Level 1b, 8 Level 2b, 2 Level 3b and 3 Level 4 studies by OCEBM grading. Pooled analysis of studies revealed that complications commonly observed were impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO)",

Our findings highlighted that the health-related quality of life (HRQoL), measured using SF-36, is considerably reduced in CoV survivors at 6 months postinfection, shows only slight improvement beyond 6 months and remains below normal population and those with chronic conditions [ Figure 9 ]. As these SF-36 scores reflect impairment in physical, mental and social functioning of well-being, it is not surprising that the key areas of impairments identified in our systematic review were pulmonary dysfunction, reduced exercise tolerance and psychological problems.",

The sample size ranged from a case series of 4 patients to a cohort study of 406 patients.

Studies reporting prevalence of diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (10 studies), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (6 studies), forced vital capacity (FVC) (5 studies) and total lung capacity (TLC) (4 studies) abnormalities were used to pool prevalence of each abnormality [Figure 2 and 3]. At 6 months, abnormalities in DLCO, FVC and TLC were more prevalent than abnormalities in FEV1. Most of these abnormalities improved after 6 months, however, the prevalence of DLCO impairment remained considerably high even 6 months post-infection, with pooled estimate of 24.35 (95% confidence interval 11.05 to 45.46).
