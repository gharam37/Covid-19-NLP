            "text": "Treatments are urgently needed to prevent hypoxemic respiratory failure and death. 1 Because an in vitro study documented potential activity by hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on SARS-CoV-2 2 and small studies have released controversial results, HCQ has received intense worldwide attention. Its effectiveness for COVID-19 is highly contentious. 3 One uncontrolled French study of 26 hospitalised patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab suggested that HCQ, at a dose of 600 mg/day, decreased SARS-CoV-2 shedding and that the combination with azithromycin had further efficacy. 4 However, another uncontrolled French study found no evidence of antiviral clearance with HCQ and azithromycin in 11 hospitalised patients. 5 From a clinical perspective, a recent study randomised 62 patients in two parallel groups, one control group and one receiving HCQ treatment (400 mg/d for 5 days), and found a reduction of time to clinical recovery. 6 These patients, however, were not severely ill, the clinical endpoints were not clearly defined, and there was no stratification for comorbidities associated with a poor outcome. 6 Based on these results, the negligible cost and known safety profile of HCQ, this drug has been considered to be potentially useful in patients with SARS-CoV-2, has attracted enormous attention in social and mass media and has received FDA approval for severe cases. 7 On the other hand, fears of a shortage of this essential treatment for patients with rheumatic diseases including systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) have recently increased, and questions about its safety in patients with COVID-19 have been raised. 3 Due to the lack of unbiased data and the urgency of confirming, if possible, the clinical efficacy of HCQ in this situation, we designed an emulated trial using observational data collected in a real-world setting in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 infection requiring oxygen. The primary aim was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of oral HCQ at a daily dose of 600 mg in preventing admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and/or death by any cause; secondary aims were to assess its effectiveness in preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).",

These results were due to the absence of confusion at admission in the HCQ group (vs 6 patients with confusion in the no-HCQ group); only one patient had chronic kidney disease in the HCQ group (vs 8 in the control group); only one had heart failure (NYHA III or IV) (vs 5 patients in the no-HCQ group), and again only one had liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B or more) in the HCQ group (vs 0 in the no-HCQ group).
