Here, in unprecedented spatial resolution, we analysed the socioeconomic 43 determinants of influenza transmission in a European city. We combined geographical and 44 epidemiological data with whole genome sequencing of influenza viruses at the scale of urban 45 quarters and statistical blocks, the smallest geographic subdivisions within a city. We observed 46 annually re-occurring geographic clusters of influenza incidences, mainly associated with net 47 income, and independent of population density and living space. Vaccination against influenza 48 was also mainly associated with household income and was linked to the likelihood of influenza-49 like illness within an urban quarter. Transmissions patterns within and between quarters were 50 complex. High-resolution city-level epidemiological studies combined with social science surveys 51",
