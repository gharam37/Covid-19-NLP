We used Monte Carlo simulations to compute point estimates with 95% confidence intervals for hospital worker infections in the US based on the two scenarios. We computed potential decrease in infections if the PPE were available only to those involved in direct care of COVID-19 patients (~ 30%) and if workers aged \u2265 60 years are restricted from patient care. Estimates were adjusted for hospital workers per bed in the US compared to China and Italy. Results: The hospital worker infections per 100 deaths were 108.2 in Hubei and 94.1 in Italy. Based on Hubei scenario, we estimated that about 53,640 US hospital workers (95% CI: 43,160 to 62,251) might get infected from COVID-19. The Italian scenario suggested 53,097 US hospital worker (95% CI: 37,133 to 69,003) might get infected during the pandemic. Availability of PPE to high-risk workers could reduce counts to 28,100 (95% CI: 23,048 to 33,242) considering Hubei and to 28,354 (95% CI: 19,829 to 36,848) considering Italy. Restricting hospital workers aged \u2265 60 years from direct patient care reduced counts to 1,985 (95% CI:",

We estimated COVID-19-related counts for infections and deaths if perfect PPE conditions are available to high risk hospital workers. We also evaluated the impact of curtailing hospital-based direct patient care in workers above a certain age on estimated counts for infections and deaths.",

Similarly, if hospital workers aged \u2265 60 years are restricted from direct patient care, then the US might face 1,985 hospital worker infections (95% CI: 1,627 to 2,347) based on the Hubei scenario and about 2,002 hospital worker infections (95% CI: 1,400 to 2,602) based on the Italian scenario. Our analyses showed that death counts in US hospital workers could be as high as 1,579 (95% CI: 1,294 to 1867) based on Hubei scenario and could be around 1,592 (95% CI: 1,114 to 2,070) based on Italian scenario.
