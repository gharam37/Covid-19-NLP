Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that age is one of the strongest risk factors influencing the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. Here, we interrogate the transcriptional features and cellular landscapes of the aging human lung through integrative analysis of bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. By intersecting these age-associated changes with experimental data on host interactions between SARS-CoV-2 or its relative SARS-CoV, we identify several age-associated factors that may contribute to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. We observed that age-associated gene expression and cell populations are significantly linked to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations.",

Lung epithelial cells, macrophages, and Th1 cells decrease in abundance with age, whereas fibroblasts, pericytes and CD4+ Tcm cells increase in abundance with age. Several age-associated genes have functional effects on SARS-CoV replication, and directly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Interestingly, ageassociated genes are heavily enriched among those induced or suppressed by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These analyses illuminate potential avenues for further studies on the relationship between the aging lung and COVID-19 pathogenesis, which may inform strategies to more effectively treat this disease.",

In contrast, cell types with highly enriched expression for certain Cluster 2 genes (decreasing with age) included macrophages, dividing dendritic cells (DCs)/monocytes, and AT2 cells (Figure 2b) . Similar results were found using an independent human lung scRNA-seq dataset from the Human Lung Cell Atlas (Supplementary Figure 4a-b) 42 . Examining the muscle-enriched genes that increased in expression with age, gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment for vascular smooth muscle contraction, cGMP-PKG signaling, Z-disc, and actin cytoskeleton, among other pathways ( Figure   2c ). As for the AT2-enriched genes that decreased in expression with age, gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment for metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of antibiotics, lipid metabolism, extracellular exosome, and mitochondrial matrix (Figure 2d) . A subset of these enriched gene ontologies had also been identified by the bulk RNA-seq analysis (Figure 1e-f) . Thus, integrative analysis of bulk and single-cell transcriptomes revealed that many of the age-associated transcriptional changes in human lung can be mapped to specific cell subpopulations, suggesting that the overall abundance of these cell types, their transcriptional status, or both, may be altered with aging.",

To investigate the cellular landscape of the aging lung, we applied a gene signature-based approach 45 to infer the enrichment of different cell types from the bulk RNA-seq profiles. Since bulk RNA-seq measures the average expression of genes within a cell population, such datasets will reflect the relative proportions of the cell types that comprised the input population, though with the caveat that cell types can have overlapping expression profiles and such profiles may be altered in response to stimuli. Using this approach, we identified ageassociated alterations in the enrichment scores of several cell types (Figure 3a) . Whereas epithelial cells decreased with age, fibroblasts increased with age (Figure 3b ). This finding is consistent with the progressive loss of lung parenchyma due to reduced regenerative capacity of the aging lung 46 , as well as the increased risk for diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary fibrosis 47 . In addition, these results are concordant with the findings from analysis of human lung single-cell transcriptomes (Figure 2a-b) .",

Thus, the age-associated decrease in macrophage abundance may be a possible factor related to the greater severity of lung pathology in patients with COVID-19. Although macrophage accumulation is often associated with the pathologic inflammation of viral ARDS 49,50 , pulmonary macrophages can act to limit the duration and severity of infection by efficiently phagocytosing dead infected cells and released virions [51] [52] [53] .

In aggregate, these prior reports suggest that the precise role of lung macrophages in SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology is likely contextdependent. It is also plausible that the increased numbers of macrophages are not the primary distinction between young and old patients, but rather the functional status of the macrophages. In line with this, we observed that the age-associated changes in macrophages were specifically attributed to the pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage subset but not the immunoregulatory M2 subset 58 (Figure 3c) , though this binary classification scheme represents an oversimplification of macrophage function. Nevertheless, elucidating the consequences of age-associated changes in lung macrophages may reveal insights into the differential outcomes of older patients with .

Additionally, Th1 cells are responsive to SARS-CoV vaccines 61 and promote macrophage activation against viruses 62 .

Finally, ADK and CDKL2 exhibited preferential enrichment in AT2 cells (51.40% and 34.43%). In aggregate, these analyses showed that the age-associated genes with functional roles in SARS-CoV are expressed in specific cell types of the human lung.",

A recent study interrogated the human host factors that interact with 27 different SARS-CoV-2 proteins 64 , revealing the SARS-CoV-2 : Human protein interactome in cell lines expressing recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins. By cross-referencing the interacting host factors with the set of age-associated genes, we identified 20 factors at the intersection ( Figure   5a ). 4 of these genes showed an increase in expression with age (i.e. Cluster 1 genes), while 16 decreased in expression with age (Cluster 2 genes). Mapping these factors to their interacting SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we noted that the age-associated host factors which interact with M, Nsp13, Nsp1, Nsp7, Nsp8, Orf3a, Orf8, Orf9c, and Orf10 proteins generally decrease in expression with aging (Figure 5b) . However, a notable exception was Nsp12, as the age-associated hostfactors that interact with Nsp12 both showed increased expression with aging (CRTC3 and MYCBP2) (Figure 5c ). Nsp12 encodes for the primary RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2, and is a prime target for developing therapies against COVID-19. The observation that CRTC3 and MYCBP2 increase in expression with aging is intriguing, as these genes may be related to the activity of Nsp12/RdRp in host cells. Of note, MYCBP2 is a known repressor of cAMP signaling 65, 66 , and cAMP signaling potently inhibits contraction of airway smooth muscle cells 67 . Thus, age-associated increases in MYCBP2 could promote smooth muscle contraction, which is concordant with our analyses on age-associated gene signatures in the lung (Figure 1e) . MYCBP2 might possibly contribute to COVID-19 pathology by not only interacting with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, but also through its normal physiologic role in promoting smooth muscle contraction.",

Several age-associated genes were found to be differentially expressed upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 6a-c) . Of note, the overlap between lung ageassociated genes and SARS-CoV-2 regulated genes was statistically significant across all 3 cell lines (Figure 6d-f) , suggesting a degree of similarity between the transcriptional changes associated with aging and with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the age-associated genes that were induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, the majority of these genes increase in expression with age (Cluster 1) (Figure 6g-i) . Conversely, among the age-associated genes that were repressed by SARS-CoV-2 infection, most of these genes decrease in expression with age (Cluster 2).

We found that the aging lung is characterized by a wide array of changes that could contribute to the worse outcomes of older patients with COVID-19. On the transcriptional level, we first identified 1,285 genes that exhibit age-associated expression patterns. We subsequently demonstrated that the aging lung is characterized by several gene signatures, including increased vascular smooth muscle contraction, reduced mitochondrial activity, and decreased lipid metabolism. By integrating these data with single cell transcriptomes of human lung tissue, we further pinpointed the specific cell types that normally express the age-associated genes. We showed that lung epithelial cells, macrophages, and Th1 cells decrease in abundance with age, whereas fibroblasts and pericytes increase in abundance with age. These systematic changes in tissue composition and cell interactions can potentially propagate positive feedback loops that predispose the airways to pathological contraction 69 . We find that some of the age-associated genes have been previously identified as host factors with a functional role in SARS-CoV replication 63 , and a fraction of the age-associated factors have been shown to directly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 proteome 64 . Furthermore, age-associated genes are significantly enriched among genes directly regulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection 68 , suggesting transcriptional parallels between the aging lung and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, it is intriguing that the genes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection tend to increase in expression with aging, and vice versa.",

To determine the percentage of cells expressing a given gene, the expression matrices were converted to binary matrices by setting a threshold of expression > 0. Cell typespecific expression frequencies for each gene were then calculated using the provided cell type annotations. To identify genes preferentially expressed in a specific cell type, we further scaled the expression frequencies in R to obtain z-scores. Data were visualized in R using the NMF package 73 .

Interestingly, ontology analysis of the 49 repressed genes in Cluster 2 revealed enrichment for mitochondrion, oxidoreductase, oxidative phosphorylation, pyruvate metabolism, and lysosome (Figure 7c), indicating that these pathways are affected both by aging and by SARS-CoV-2 infection.Within the consensus set of all 78 age-associated genes that are perturbed by SARS-CoV-2 infection, the directionality of SARS-CoV-2 regulation (induced or repressed) and the directionality of age-association (increase or decrease with age) were significantly associated(Figure 7d). Analysis of the human lung scRNA-seq datasets revealed the cell types that normally express these different genes(Figure 7e and Supplementary Figure 7). While many of these genes are broadly expressed across multiple cell types, some are preferentially expressed in AT2 cells (such as PRTG, ACACA, ACSS2, AGR2, AP1M2, and MMAB).
