RT-PCR from upper respiratory tract swabs may also be falsely negative due to quality or timing; viral loads in upper respiratory tract secretions peak in the first week of symptoms, 7 but may have declined below the limit of detection in those presenting later. 8 In individuals who have recovered, RT-PCR provides no information about prior exposure or immunity.",
