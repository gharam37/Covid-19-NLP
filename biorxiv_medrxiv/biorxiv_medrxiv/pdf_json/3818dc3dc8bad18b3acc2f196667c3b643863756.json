Significant T-tests for these probe tests identified, 103 probes in dataset 4193 (GSE30153), 141 probes in dataset 4719 (GSE13887) and 66 probes in dataset 4185 (GSE10325). Additional 215 probes were found to be significant in GSE10325: Tcells, B-cells and Monocytes datasets. Hence, a total of 525 statistically significant probe sets in six (3+3) GEO datasets were finalized. This composite probe list was matched against the SNIPPER reference gene list of 410 genes, to remove those that the GEO query included, however, were not found in the OASIS SLE loci. Hence, 187 unique genes in the 6 GEO datasets were identified that had significant change in expression and were located in the 30 SLE loci (Table S2) .",

It is located at the 12p11.21 locus that associated with SLE in two GWAS. Moreover, DDX11 was found to be downregulated in SLE in multiple expression datasets and this finding was confirmed with qPCR in SLE monocytes. These findings confirm DDX11, a DNA helicase, as a novel SLE gene. DDX11 mutations cause the Warsaw Breakage Syndrome (WABS), an autosomal recessive cohesinopathy with the clinical triad of severe congenital microcephaly, growth restriction, and sensorineural hearing loss (Eppley et al., 2017) . WABS shows features of genome instability similar to Fanconi anemia (FA). Several genes are involved in the FA pathway which is critical to DNA repair of interstrand crosslinks (ICL). DDX11 functions as a FA pathway backup and its deficiency leads to impaired ICL repair (Abe et al., 2018) . Moreover, DDX11 plays an important role in B-cell immunoglobulin (Ig) diversification (Abe et al., 2018) which makes it an even more interesting candidate gene for SLE. Inhibition of DDX11 expression led to extensive apoptosis in melanoma cells (Bhattacharya et al. 2012 ).",
