            "text": "While traditional microbiological freshwater tests focus on the detection of specific bacterial indicator species including pathogens, direct tracing of all aquatic DNA through metagenomics poses a profound alternative. Yet, in situ metagenomic water surveys face substantial challenges in cost and logistics. Here we present a simple, fast, inexpensive and remotely accessible freshwater diagnostics workflow centred around the portable nanopore sequencing technology. Using defined compositions and spatiotemporal microbiota from surface water of an example river in Cambridge (UK), we provide optimised experimental and bioinformatics guidelines, including a benchmark with twelve taxonomic classification tools for nanopore sequences. We find that nanopore metagenomics depicts both, the hydrological core microbiome and fine temporal gradients in line with complementary physicochemical measurements. Using reference-based sequence clustering, these data feature relevant sewage signals and pathogen maps at species level resolution. We anticipate that this framework will gather momentum for new environmental monitoring initiatives using portable devices. Extended Data Figure 2: Bioinformatics consensus workflow. Essential data processing steps, from nanopore sequencing to spatiotemporal bacterial composition analysis (Methods). After full-length 16S rDNA sequencing with the MinION (R9.4 flow cell), local basecalling of the raw fast5 files was performed using Guppy 69 . Output fastq files were filtered for length and quality (Methods), and reads assigned to their location barcode using Porechop. We then used Minimap2 15 (k = 15) and the SILVA v.132 database 16 for taxonomic classifications. Rarefaction reduced each sample to the same number of reads (37,000), allowing for a robust comparison of bacterial composition across samples in various downstream analyses. Extended Data Figure 3: Impact of rarefaction on diversity estimation. (a) Example rarefaction curve for bacterial family classifications of the 'April-1' sample. The chosen cut-off preserves most (~90 %) of the original family taxon richness (vertical line). (b) Difference between original and rarefied family richness at 37,000 reads across all freshwater sequencing runs with quantitative sequencing outputs above the chosen cut-off. Boxplots feature 100 independent rarefactions per sample. Error bars represent Q1 -1.5*IQR (lower), and Q3 + 1.5*IQR (upper), respectively. (c) Diversity visualisation of the ten most abundant bacterial families across all samples with sequencing outputs >37,000 reads, through 400 'unordered bubbles'. Taxonomic proportions and colours are in accordance with Figure 2b. Shannon (H) and Simpson (D) indices for all samples indicate marginal differences between pairs of original and rarefied sets.

These trends enforce an increasing demand for freshwater monitoring frameworks that combine cost effectiveness, fast technology deployability and data transparency 4 . Environmental metagenomics, the tracing of organisms present in a substrate through high-throughput DNA sequencing, yields informative measures of relative taxonomic species occurrence and functional diversity 5 .

The main driver of this is the smartphone-sized MinION device from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), which enables real-time DNA sequencing using nanopores 6 . Nanopore read lengths can be comparably long (currently up to ~2*10 6 bases 7 ), which is enabled by continuous electrical sensing of sequential nucleotides along single DNA strands. In connection with a laptop or cloud access for the translation of raw voltage signal into nucleotides, nanopore sequencing can be used to rapidly monitor long DNA sequences in remote locations. Although there are still common concerns about the technology's base-level accuracy, mobile MinION setups have already proven powerful for real-time tracing and open data sharing during bacterial and viral pathogen outbreaks [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

Although we had access to basic infrastructure such as pipettes, a PCR and TissueLyser II machine, as well a high-performance laptop, we wish to highlight that the total sequencing consumable costs were held below \u00a34,000 (Supplementary Table 6a ). Here, individual costs ranged at ~\u00a375 per sample (Supplementary Table   6b ). With the current MinION flow cell price of \u00a3720, we estimate that per-sample costs could be further reduced to as low as ~\u00a315 when barcoding and pooling ~\u00a3100 samples in the same sequencing run (Supplementary Table   6c ). Assuming near-equimolar amplicon pooling, flow cells with an output of ~5,000,000 reads can yield well over 37,000 sequences per sample and thereby surpass this conservative threshold applied here for comparative river microbiota analyses.",

Overall, 55.9 % (n = 4,644,194) of raw reads could be taxonomically assigned to the family level (Figure 2b). To account for variations in sample sequencing depth, rarefaction with a cut-off at 37,000 reads was applied to all samples. While preserving ~90 % of the original family level taxon richness (Mantel test, R = 0.814, p = 2.1*10 -4 ; Extended Data Figure 3), this conservative thresholding resulted in the exclusion of 14 samples, mostly from the June time point, for subsequent high-resolution analyses. The 16 remaining surface water samples revealed moderate levels of microbial heterogeneity (Figure 2b; Extended Data Figure 3): microbial family alpha diversity ranged between 0.46 (June-6) and 0.92 (April-7) (Simpson index), indicating partially lowlevel evenness with a few taxonomic families that account for the majority of the metagenomic signal. Hierarchical clustering of taxon profiles showed a dominant core microbiome across all aquatic samples (clusters C2 and C4, Figure 2c). The most common bacterial families observed were Burkholderiaceae (40.0 %), Spirosomaceae (17.7 %), and NS11-12 marine group (12.5 %), followed by Arcobacteraceae (4.8 %), Sphingomonadaceae (2.9 %)",

In combination with sampling protocol adjustments, shotgun nanopore sequencing could moreover be used for the monitoring of eukaryotic microorganisms and viruses in freshwater ecosystems. Since the commercial launch of the MinION in 2015, a wide set of nanopore sequencing applications like rRNA gene 38-41 and shotgun 42-45 metagenomics have attracted the interest of a growing user community; indeed, two independent case studies have recently provided decomposition analyses of faecal bacterial pathogens in MinION libraries derived from river and spring waters in Crow Agency (Montana, USA) 46 and Kathmandu Valley (Nepal) 47 . Although it is to be expected that short-read metagenomics technology continues to provide valuable environmental insights, as illustrated through global cataloguing efforts of ocean 48 , wastewater 24 and soil 49 microbiomes, many traditional platforms are unfeasible for monitoring remote environments -especially in lowresource settings. We reason that the low investment costs, the convenience of MinION handling and complementary development of portable DNA purification methods 50 will allow for such endeavours to become increasingly accessible to citizens and public health organisations around the world, ultimately democratising the opportunities, open sharing and benefits of DNA sequencing.
