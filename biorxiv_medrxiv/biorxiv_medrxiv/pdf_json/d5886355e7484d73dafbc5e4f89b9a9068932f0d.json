In this 36 study, we report the generation of clinical-grade human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)-derived 37 immunity-and matrix-regulatory cells (IMRCs) manufactured under good manufacturing practice (GMP) 38 requirements, that can treat lung injury and fibrosis in vivo. We generate IMRCs through sequentially 39 differentiating hESCs with xeno-free reagents. IMRCs possess a unique gene expression profile distinct 40 from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs), such as higher levels of proliferative, 41 immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic genes. Moreover, intravenous delivery of IMRCs inhibits both 42 pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mouse models of lung injury, and significantly improves the 43 survival rate of the recipient mice in a dose-dependent manner, likely through their paracrine functions. 44",
