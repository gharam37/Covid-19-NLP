In particular, single use disposable N95 face masks have been limited in 34 supply. We have developed an Injection Molded Autoclavable, Scalable, Conformable (iMASC) 35 system for aerosol-based protection. The iMASC system was designed as a reusable liquid 36 silicone rubber mask with disposable N95 filter cartridges that can fit most face sizes and shapes. 37 This system reduced the amount of N95 filter while preserving breathability and fit. Using finite 38 element analysis, we demonstrated mask deformation and reaction forces from facial scans of 39 twenty different wearers. In addition, we validated these findings by successful fit testing in 40 twenty participants in a prospective clinical trial.

In some 47 places, the complete lack of PPE has resulted in healthcare workers using PPE that may have 48 variable droplet protection (1) . Shortages of PPE have significant impact among healthcare 49 workers who evaluate individuals with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 disease (1) (2) . First, 50 individuals using PPE acquired outside of the hospital may inadvertently be using PPE without 51 droplet protection resulting in inadequate protection. Second, workers without PPE will acquire 52 infections, including COVID-19, at greater rates than those with adequate PPE (3). Infected 53 healthcare workers may transmit disease to family members, worsening the pandemic (4). Third, 54 with increased COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers, the available workforce to 55 address sick patients decreases, resulting in increasing morbidity and mortality (4). There is 56 therefore a critical need to develop innovative measures to generate safe, reusable PPE. 57 Thus, we have designed and fabricated an Injection Molded Autoclavable, Scalable, 58 Conformable (iMASC) system for aerosol-based protection with N95 material filters that can be 59 inserted and replaced as needed. To understand the ability of our mask to conform to multiple 60 face sizes and shapes, we have undertaken finite element analysis evaluating the deformability of 61 the iMASC system. Lastly, we performed a prospective clinical trial for fit testing of our mask as 62 well as qualitative assessment of the mask compared to the current N95 masks. Our goal is to 63 address the critical shortage of N95 face masks to maximally protect healthcare workers and 64 provide an enduring supply chain of N95 face masks to reduce and prevent COVID-19 65 transmission among healthcare workers and patients.

            "text": "Design and generation of injection molded liquid silicone rubber mask 69 The iMASC system was designed to function as an N95-comparable mask (Fig. 1) . The 70 shape of the iMASC system was modeled from disposable regular N95 masks used in the 71 hospital, which are amenable to many different face sizes and shapes. Medical grade liquid 72 silicone rubber (LSR) was identified as an optimal material for mask fabrication due to its 73 conformable capacity, sterilizability through multiple methods and compatibility with injection 74 molding for fabrication scalability. The weight of the iMASC system was 44.84 \u00b1 0.05 grams (n = 75 3) compared to 10.41 \u00b1 0.13 grams (n = 3) of current N95 masks. We employed a dual filter 76 approach similar to half-mask elastomeric respirators to increase breathability and filtration area 77 (5). A single regular N95 mask generated up to 5 filters for the iMASC system, thus extending the 78 N95 material use. Furthermore, based upon the material selection of a medical grade LSR, the 79 iMASC system is reusable after sterilization by cleaning with hospital grade bleach/alcohol 80 wipes, autoclave and heating methods. Characterization of mask material after sterilization 83 An advantage of the iMASC system over the half-mask respirators is the methods of 84 sterilization (see table S1). We have performed tensile tests of the mask material after 10 85 autoclave cycles and 5 minutes in a 1:10 bleach solution and 70% isopropyl alcohol. We found 86 All rights reserved.

These variations are duo to the 112 difference in shape and size of the subject's faces especially in the jaw and cheekbone parts. 113 Through application of these forces via the straps combined with the aluminum strip across the 114 nose bridge, one can guarantee the mask will be tightly stayed in place.",

The breakdown of participants by profession 131 was 46% nurses (n=11), 21% attending physicians (n=5), 21% resident physicians (n=5), and 132 12% technicians (n=3). Of these participants, 4 did not perform the fit testing (1 due to inability to 133 detect saccharin solution on pre-mask placement sensitivity test, 2 due to time, and 1 due to fit of 134 the mask on her face). 135 All participants (n=20) that performed the fit test successfully completed the fit test as part 136 of the hospital annual policy. All participants passed their fit test and were also able to 137 successfully replace the filter into the mask, resulting in a 100% success rate for both fit testing 138 and filter exchange. User experience with the iMASC system was evaluated using a Likert scale 139 with a score of 1 indicating excellent and a score of 5 indicating very poor. Of the 20 participants, 140 the average fit score of the mask was a 1.75 (Fig. 3B) . Participants on average scored the 141 breathability of the mask as a 1.6 with a median of 1.5. Finally, ease of replacing the filter on the 142 mask was scored on average as a 2.05 with a median score of 2. Participants' preference to wear 143 the iMASC over a surgical mask or an N95 respirator was also assessed. Sixty percent of 144 participants indicated they would be willing to wear our mask instead of a surgical mask, with 145 20% indicating no preference between our mask and a standard surgical mask and 20% indicating 146 they would prefer to wear a surgical mask (Fig. 3C) . When asked about preference to wear our 147 mask instead of an N95 respirator, 25% of participants indicated they would prefer to wear our 148 mask and 60% indicated no preference between our mask and a standard issue mask, with only 149 15% indicating they would prefer to wear a standard issue N95 respirator (Fig. 3D) . During times of pandemics, it is essential to protect healthcare workers from infection and 153 transmission of disease with adequate PPE (4, 9) . As stocks of N95 face masks have reduced, 154 healthcare workers are forced to find alternative strategies of protection, including re-sterilizing 155 masks and using alternative mask materials that may result in less protection and higher disease 156 transmission (9-10). Our approach here was to develop a scalable, reusable face mask that can 157 extend the amount of N95 material while providing the same droplet protection as standard N95 158 masks. The iMASC system was shown to successfully fit multiple different face sizes and shapes 159 using an OSHA approved testing method. Based on the success of the iMASC system in fit 160 testing, this approach could be scaled up for use across many locations. By selecting injection 161 molding as the fabrication technique for the iMASC system, we believe we possess a fundamental 162 advantage to other initiatives using three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques because injection 163 molding is highly scalable and has decreased production time when compared to 3D printing. 164 These are initial proof-of-concept studies and have some limitations. First, filter 165 replacement was noted to be slightly challenging and additional design changes, such as slight 166 adjustments to dimensions and tolerances, would likely improve the fit and robustness. Additional 167 investigation into user sizing of head straps will be investigated, so as to accommodate more 168 potential users. All post injection-molding manufacturing steps were completed in-house and in 169 large scale production would be outsourced to contracted manufacturers with greater quality 170 control of filter components. 171 Newer face masks, such as our iMASC system, have potential to resupply hospitals and 172 clinicals with effective N95-comparable masks.

Next, two sets of facial measurements were 228 taken: from the tip of the subject's nose to the base of their chin and across the width of their 229 cheekbones. Each subject's face was also scanned by a 3D scanner to generate a digital file.230 Subjects underwent fit testing in accordance with the protocol outline in the OSHA 231 guidance in Appendix A of 1910.134 using the Gerson Respirator Fit Test kit (part # 065000). In 232 brief, a demonstration was performed to show subjects how to put on a respirator, how it should 233 be positioned on the face, how to set the strap tension and how to determine a proper fit. Subjects 234 then selected a respirator from the two available sizes and adjusted the facepiece until it provided 235 an acceptable fit and was comfortable. Fit was defined as proper placement of the chin; adequate 236 strap tension; fit across the bridge of the nose; tendency of respirator to slip; and ensuring the 237 respirator was of proper size to span between the bridge of the nose and the chin through self-238 observation in a mirror. Comfort was defined as the position of the mask on the nose, face, and 239 cheeks; room for eye protection; and room to talk. Once the mask was deemed comfortable and of 240 adequate fit, the subject performed a user seal check. To check positive pressure, subjects gently 241 exhaled while wearing the mask to see if the facepiece bulged slightly.
