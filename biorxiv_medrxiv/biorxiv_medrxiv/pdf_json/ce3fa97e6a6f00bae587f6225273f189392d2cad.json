To avoid their influence on the results, only V j values for the period March 5-22, 2020 (12 29 j t \uf0a3 \uf0a3 , see Table 2) were used to calculate this first prediction. For other predictions different values of the initial t j1 and final t j2 moments of time were used. They are shown in Tables 3-5 together with corresponding number of observations n. The SIR curves for the prediction No. 4 (calculated with the use of the recent V j values without taking into account maximum number of initial moments of time) are shown in Fig. 1. Markers represent the V j values taken for calculations (\"circles\"); for a comparison (\"triangles\") and a verification of predictions (\"star\"). It can be seen that the real epidemic outbreak could start even in January 2020. Probably, first cases of COVID-2019 infection were not identified and sick people were not isolated. It could be a reason of the high saturation level of the epidemic (approximately 148,000 -153,000 according to the last predictions 3 and 4).

It can be seen that the first case of COVID-2019 infection in Chernivtsi was probably timely identified and isolated. The epidemic outbreak was probably caused by other persons. Preliminary estimations of the saturation level are approximately 1,700 -2,000 (according to the last predictions 2-2, 5-2 and 6-1).
