This paper explores the mechanism of the influence of information diffusion on the spread of the novel coronavirus, develops a model of the interaction between information diffusion and disease transmission based on the SIR model, and empirically tests the role and mechanism of information diffusion in the spread of COCID-19 by using econometric method. The result shows that there was a significant negative correlation between the information diffusion and the spread of the novel coronavirus; The result of robust test shows that the spread of both epidemic information and protection information hindered the further spread of the epidemic.",

            "text": "difficulty of epidemic prevention and control. In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the central government has taken unprecedented prevention and control measures, including setting up designated admission hospitals, expanding the supply of beds in the hospital, coordinating the dispatch of medical prevention and control materials, extending the Spring Festival holiday, implementing peak staggering return, measuring the temperature of vehicles and stations, disinfecting, ventilating, etc. The National Health Commission has also sent a number of supervision teams to hospitals and disease control agencies to conduct on-site supervision. Wuhan also announced the closure of the city on January 23, suspending urban public transport and strictly controlling the access of people inside and outside Wuhan. Subsequently, 31 provinces, regions and cities in the country successively launched the level 1 emergency response to public health emergencies, strictly controlled the transmission of the virus, and made every effort to prevent the further spread of the epidemic. At the early stage of the epidemic (December 31 to January 20), due to the lack of public reports in Wuhan's official media, the information of the epidemic was mainly disclosed by the media, so the epidemic was not paid attention by the public, which delayed the best time to expand the social impact, thus leading to the further spread of the epidemic. After January 20, with the outbreak of the epidemic and the release of information, COVID-19 epidemic information became the most concerned information of the public, and media reports entered a white-hot stage. The emergence of the novel coronavirus pneumonia has also caused widespread panic among the public. The official media, micro-blog, WeChat and other media have followed up the reports of real-time epidemic, new symptoms and prevention measures, and timely conveyed clear and positive information to the society and advised the public to protect themselves and to view the epidemic more objectively and objectively. Will the information diffusion help to eliminate rumors and guide the public to do a good job in protection and further inhibit the spread of the epidemic? Therefore, understanding the impact of information diffusion on epidemic transmission can help improve the prediction of epidemics and find preventive measures to slow down the spread of diseases. Therefore, this paper studies the problems above. The innovation points of the research are as follows: First, combing the epidemic theory, complex network analysis and the temporal and spatial background of the COVID-19 spread, we comb the mechanism of epidemic transmission; Second, we use econometric method to conduct a regress, and get the basic conclusion that information diffusion can effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19; third, using big data mining technology, Baidu search index, Baidu population migration, prevention and control data during the epidemic were mined through Baidu and government information websites at all levels. The remaining sections of the paper are as follows: the second section combs the research literature and puts forward the hypothesis; the third section is the research design, which describes the model construction, data source, main variable calculation, and statistical description; the fourth section is empirical analysis. The fifth section is a conclusion and discussion. ",

            "text": "Since the beginning of the 21st century, due to the outbreak of SARS, avian influenza, novel H1N1 influenza and Ebola cross the world, the public has been increasingly concerned about the emerging infectious diseases, and the problem of disease transmission has been widely studied (Mao & Yang, 2012) . In general, the spread of an epidemic is considered to be a dynamic process in which the disease passes from one individual to another through contact between individuals on the contact network (kleczkowski et al., 2011) . Disease transmission often occurs in a dynamic social environment, and individual health behavior decision-making is guided by cultural norms, peer behavior and media reports (Kim et al., 2019) . Although vaccination is a major strategy to protect individuals from infection, the development, testing and production of new vaccines often take a long time (stohr &amp; esveld, 2004) . Before getting enough vaccines, the best protection for individuals is to take preventive actions, such as wearing masks, washing hands frequently, taking drugs, avoiding contact with patients, etc. (Centers for Disease Control and prevention, 2008) . The historical experience of SARS tells us that effective national control measures, such as early identification and isolation of SARS cases, tracking and isolation of the contacts, screening of travelers, and raising public awareness of risk, can help to contain the spread of the virus (Ahmad et al., 2009) . As the public gradually realized the importance of personal behavior in preventing the spread of infection, researchers began to explore the mathematical model of disease transmission including personal behavior. These models have been used to guide strategies for disease transmission control (vardavas et al., 2007) and quantify the role of individual protective measures in controlling several outbreaks, including the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa in 2014 (fast et al., 2007) , the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003 and the H1N1 outbreak in central Mexico in 2009 Mexico in (springborn et al., 2007 . Saunders et al. (2017) also tested the effectiveness of personal protective measures in preventing the spread of pandemic influenza in humans. Recently, the research on the outbreak of COVID-19 from the perspective of transmission dynamics is also increasing. Sun et al. (2020) evaluated the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 based on the public epidemic data, and studied the outbreak progress in all parts of China. Understanding the impact of the media on the spread of the disease can help improve the prediction of epidemics and identify preventive measures to slow the spread of the disease. Many models also link the disease-related media transmission with the protection function, usually assuming that the influence of media will reduce the effective transmission rate and slow down the spread of diseases. These studies indicate that the impact of media increases with the number of people infected (Sun et al., 2011; , or both with the number and the rate of change (tchuenche &amp; bauch, 2012; Xiao et al., 2015) . When the number of cases is high or the prevalence of diseases increases rapidly, the information diffusion slows down the spread of diseases and creates interesting disease transmission dynamics, such as multi-wave outbreaks . However, it is not clear whether the media function formalization proposed by the model fully reflects the actual influence. The choice of media function directly affects the form of disease transmission, making the accurate parameterization of the media is the key (collison et al., 2014) . However, most of the current researches only focus on the development of the disease itself on the complex network, as well as the impact of protective measures on the spread of the disease. There are relatively few studies on the spread of disease-related information, and only a few of them are carried out through numerical simulation with the preconditions which are too idealized and too dependent on the setting of parameters. In addition, the model has just begun to consider how to combine the data from actual media reports (collison et al., 2015) , lacking the econometric analysis based on real-time data. In decade years, China's Internet has experienced unprecedented development, various online social media based on the Internet (such as major search engines, social networking sites, news sites, etc.) have been integrated into people's daily life, providing a broad platform for the dissemination of various information. Compared with the outbreak of SARS in 2003, the economic link between regions are increasingly close, and during the Spring Festival in China, the population flow is more frequent. Although the government has taken unprecedented measures to prevent and control the epidemic, and the official media and social media have timely released the latest epidemic information, the actual effect needs to be further tested. By combing and integrating the existing literature, we propose the hypothesis that information diffusion is helpful to curb the spread of new coronavirus.",

It can be seen that the place with the most public opinion information is actually not the place where the epidemic is the most serious (such as Hubei Province, but it does not rule out that the epidemic area has no time to process the information), but the first-tier provinces such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong (The situation in these cities is still severe, but it is relatively stable compared to Hubei Province).

The information has improved the public's awareness of the virus. Many people choose to continue to pay attention to the epidemic-related information, and respond faster when the outbreak later occurs, reducing the probability of infection. In the stage of the outbreak, information about it will also be spread on major social media. When individuals learn about the existence of the disease, they will change their behavior, such as wearing a mask and vaccinating to avoid being infected, which can have an impact on the spread of the disease. The susceptible (or infected person) who knows the information of the epidemic will break the connection with the around infected person (or susceptible person) in order to prevent the further spread of the ",

However, few people committed to combining information diffusion and human behavior, considering these two interactive processes. In fact, when a disease-related information spreads among people, people will naturally take some precautionary measures to counteract it, which in turn limits the spread of the disease. In order to study the impact of information diffusion on epidemic outbreaks, this paper draws on the conceptual framework of Mao & Yang (2012) to develop a model of the interaction between disease and information. We divided the population into two categories according to their health status: the susceptible (S) and the (I); according to the level of information obtained, they were divided into two categories: conscious (+) and unconscious (-). Therefore, the population in the entire society can be divided into four states: (1) S\u2212: unconscious susceptible; (2) S +: conscious susceptible; (3) I\u2212: unconscious infected; (4) I +: conscious infected. As shown in the figure 5, the transmission process of COVID-19 including the information diffusion is proposed. The entire propagation process of the model is described as follows: the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

Since this measure belongs to \"social isolation\", the \"social isolation\" score of Shanghai was 1 from January 21. On January 24, Shanghai began to implement the \"partial cessation of public places in the city\", then the \"social isolation\" was added 1 point from January 24, and so on.

In terms of variables reflecting population migration, the coefficient of urban population migration variable is significantly negative, indicating that the decrease in population inflows and outflows has also reduced the spread of COVID-19; the coefficient of Wuhan population inflow variables is significantly positive, indicating that the population inflow in Wuhan has accelerated the spread of the virus to a certain extent.

After excluding Wuhan from the sample, the regression results are still robust. Secondly, two robustness tests of information classification and new confirmed diagnoses show that both the spread of epidemic information and self-protection information have significantly reduced the further spread of the COVID-19.

This article puts forward the following suggestions: (1) The government convenes a press conference in a timely manner to disclose the epidemic situation information and make the information transmission more transparent. The state-run media played a role of weathervane, they need to timely follow up the epidemic report to let public learn about the virus. (2) Do a good job of information management and control.
