Most of the studies used a recovery endpoint for the primary analysis. We propose to accompany the primary analysis with multistate methodology. We highlight, that literature provides an extensive statistical tool box of suitable models to analyze clinical trials. All ongoing clinical trials, especially those with severe cases, should accommodate primary analysis with a stacked probability plot of the major events mechanical ventilation, discharge alive and death. The resulting informative plot is a powerful tool to harmonize the diversity of clinical endpoints and lengths of follow-up and thereby fastening accessibility of evidence and thus decision making. Additionally, treatment effects on a number of (potentially clinically opposite) endpoints can be studied simultaneously over time using cause-specific Cox regression and by estimating sojourn time spent in the various states. Moreover, while mechanical ventilation, hospitalization and mortality are objective outcomes, recovery and other states of severity are influenced by clinical judgement and may be additionally subject to measurement errors.",

Rather than suggesting COS for COVID-19 trials, we provide a way for simultaneous evaluation of multiple endpoints within COS using information all of the available data.",

The model accounts for mechanical ventilation, discharge alive and death. Treatment effects on duration of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay and death are directly quantifiable.The course of a patients hospital stay in the treatment and control groups can be visualized with a stacked probability plot(11)(Figure 2). Important events of interest are visualized simultaneously over time in a single informative plot. The results of clinical trials are directly comparable if the stacked probability plots are published as a complement to the statistical analysis. Differing lengths of follow-up are accounted for by the time-dependent graphical display of the probabilities of being in one of the states of interest. Moreover, the events in this multistate model are objective and not subject to selection bias due to clinical judgement. For the stacked probability plots the following information needs to be recorded: -Hospital admission and discharge dates -Vital state at end of follow-up -Death date, if applicable -Dates of mechanical ventilation",
