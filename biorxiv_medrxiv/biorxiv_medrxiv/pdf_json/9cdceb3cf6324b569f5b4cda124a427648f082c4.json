Recent studies have found that the pathogen of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, shares the same cell receptor Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) with SARS-CoV. The pathological investigation of COVID-19 death showed that the lung had the characteristics of pulmonary fibrosis. However, how SARS-CoV-2 spreads from the lungs to other organs has not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell-type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy and fibrotic lungs, as well as in normal and failed adult human hearts, using published single-cell RNA-seq data. We found that ACE2 expression in fibrotic lungs mainly locates in arterial vascular cells, which might provide the route for bloodstream spreading of SARS-CoV-2. The failed human hearts have a higher percentage of ACE2expressing cardiomyocytes, and SARS-CoV-2 might attack cardiomyocytes through the bloodstream in patients with heart failure.",

The pathogen named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) showed 79.5% genome similarity to SARS-CoV and 96% to a bat coronavirus RaTG13 1 . Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) can specifically bind to the S1 domain of SARS-CoV S protein as a functional receptor 2 and is also the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 has been widely recognized as a negative regulatory enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that converts Ang II into Ang1-7 /Ang 1-9 and has a protective role in cardiovascular function 3 . Upon spike protein of coronavirus binding to the cellular receptor ACE2, the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) TMPRSS2 cleaves the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to promote fusion of viral and cellular membranes 4 .",

A retrospective cohort study indicates that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bilateral pulmonary infiltration are associated with higher mortality 11 .

SARS-CoV-2 depends on TMPRSS2 and FURIN to infect target cells4,5 . Both TMPRSS2 and FURIN were expressed in AT2 cells of normal lungs, whereas only FURIN was expressed in arterial vascular cells of fibrotic lungs (Fig. 2A-2B), indicating that the entryway of SARS-CoV-2 might depend on FURIN in fibrotic lungs, which is different from the normal lungs. These observations show that ACE2 is mainly expressed in arterial vascular cells in fibrotic lungs, which might help SARS-CoV-2 to enter blood vessels and cause bloodstream spreading of SARS-CoV-2 after infection.",
