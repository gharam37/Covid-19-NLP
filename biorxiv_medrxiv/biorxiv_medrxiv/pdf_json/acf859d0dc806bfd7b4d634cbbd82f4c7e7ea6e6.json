Many public health responses and modeled scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-2 assume that infection results in an immune response that protects individuals from future infections or illness for some amount of time. The timescale of protection is a critical determinant of the future impact of the pathogen. The presence or absence of protective immunity due to infection or vaccination (when available) will affect future transmission and illness severity. The dynamics of immunity and nature of protection are relevant to discussions surrounding therapeutic use of convalescent sera as well as efforts to identify individuals with protective immunity. Here, we review the scientific literature on antibody immunity to coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 as well as the related SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and human endemic coronaviruses (HCoVs). We reviewed 1281 abstracts and identified 322 manuscripts relevant to 5 areas of focus: 1) antibody kinetics, 2) correlates of protection, 3) immunopathogenesis, 4) antigenic diversity and cross-reactivity, and 5) population seroprevalence. While studies of SARS-CoV-2 are necessary to determine immune responses to it, evidence from other coronaviruses can provide clues and guide future research.",

Limited pre-existing immunity to this virus is thought to be responsible for the explosive increase in cases across the world. Nearly all transmission models of SARS-CoV-2 assume that infection produces immunity to reinfection for durations of at least one year [1] [2] [3] . This assumption is relevant to public health officials implementing and managing various non-pharmaceutical interventions, the utility of sera from infected individuals as a therapeutic 4 , and the ability for serological tests to identify those who are immune 5 . The dynamics of immunity will also affect the performance of serological testing to quantify the extent of infection in populations. However, knowledge of the dynamics and nature of immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited, and the scientific basis for durable immunity, upon which these key public health and clinical strategies are dependent, is not well developed.",

HCoVs have been used in human challenge experiments since shortly after their discovery in 1965 10, 11 . These experiments, where individuals were intentionally infected with HCoV, provide some of the clearest characterization of human responses to coronaviruses and the potential for immune responses to limit infection and disease. Multiple human challenge studies measured antibody immunity before a coronavirus challenge and identified antibody responses that were associated with protection from infection, serological response or symptom 12 . The low severity of HCoV allowed for safe use of these viruses in human challenge experiments. The greater likelihood of severe illness in SARS-CoV-2 limits the applicability of such experiments, although some have argued for their use in subsets of the population 13 .",

As with other introductions of novel pathogens 14 , explosive outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 across the globe may threaten its persistence by reducing the number of available hosts susceptible to infection. Immune interactions with endemic coronaviruses could theoretically affect the short-and long-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, and vice versa 15,16 through cross-protection or antibody-dependent enhancement 17 , but these interactions and effects are not yet understood. If SARS-CoV-2 does become endemic, age-stratified seroprevalence studies of endemic coronaviruses may provide estimates for incidence rates in the presence of higher levels of population immunity.",

We conceptualize the stages of exposure and infection at which immunity may play a role in the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, and how literature describing work on this and other coronaviruses can provide insights into these stages, as follows 5 (see Figure 1 , a visual abstract of our review). First, an exposure to a pathogen generates an immune response that changes over time and between individuals (antibody kinetics). Upon exposure, infection history might play a role in providing protection against new infection, and the literature can provide evidence for such correlates of protection through challenge studies and longitudinal cohort studies. Upon infection, an individual's immune state, possibly impacted by pre-existing antibodies to other coronaviruses (among other mechanisms), may cause harm through immunopathogenesis, and the literature on this topic primarily consists of in vitro experiments. Correlates of immunity (or risk through immunopathogenesis) are complicated by the existence of multiple genera of coronaviruses that are antigenically diverse and may provide cross-protection, and may also cause false positive assay results due to cross-reactivity. Finally, the preceding phenomena at the individual level interact to determine population seroprevalence. Studies that measure these quantities across different age groups can provide evidence, albeit ecological evidence, for or against proposed mechanisms of immunity at the individual level.",

The second category of assays was neutralization assays. Neutralization assays are typically considered the gold standard for measuring functional antibody responses as they measure biological activity throughout the viral replication process. Researchers have used assays of both types to characterize antibody activity by antibody class (i.e. IgG, IgM, IgA). As these antibodies are known to have different temporal dynamics, we reported when specific classes of antibodies were characterized in figures. If no characterization was specified, we reported the measures of antibody aggregated across all classes. The source of samples in the reviewed studies was almost exclusively serum samples.

Several studies on MERS-CoV as well as the first preliminary analyses on SARS-CoV-2 explicitly explore this connection, while fewer studies on endemic HCoVs and SARS CoV-1 do so. Several studies found that cases of varying severity (e.g., asymptomatic, mild, and severe) developed detectable antibodies against HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV 33,41-44 . One study 45 found that the rise in antibodies between acute and convalescent sera correlated positively with symptoms and clinical score in 15 patients experimentally infected with HCoV-229E (Table 1) . However, most studies of SARS-CoV-1 did not report symptom severity, and evidence of differences in antibody responses among cases experiencing symptoms of different severity is inconclusive. SARS-CoV-1 survivors with sequelae were found to have lower neutralizing antibodies than patients without sequelae 37 , although the same study otherwise found no significant differences in kinetics according to disease severity. Another study 39 found no evidence of difference in antibody responses between patients who survived or died. In MERS-CoV, on the other hand, Ko et al. 46 found that both seroconversion rate and peak antibody levels increased with disease severity, while Okba et al. 47 reported a robust response to severe infections as opposed to low or no seroconversion in asymptomatic and mild cases. Milder infections also appeared to be less likely to elicit serologic responses 47,48 , although Okba et al. suggests that seroconversion detection may depend on the antibodies being targeted. More severe cases were also found to have slower responses 24,27 ; 75% of patients who died had not seroconverted by week 3 46 .

All data on time to seroconversion was based on symptomatic patients. No data were available for asymptomatic individuals. (Figure 4 ). The studies reporting symptom severity with longer-term data focused on MERS-CoV. Not all of these studies reported a cutoff for the assay used; in those that did, two thirds of patients with mild symptoms had detectable or positive IgG antibodies at six months and one year, while all patients with severe symptoms had detectable IgG antibodies at the same points in time ( Table 1) .",

Sera from BALB/c mice immunized with full length S protein from civet strains were ineffective against human SARS-CoV-1 and vice versa 88 . Despite significant crossreactions between mAbs against conformational epitopes of RBD with multiple mutational differences, single mutations were shown to disrupt neutralizability 89 . In contrast, mAbs targeting regions critical for fusion and entry on the S2 protein are immunogenic and can broadly neutralize SARS-CoV-1 strains 59,90 . A recent study showed reduced binding of mAbs from SARS patients to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, especially those that blocked binding to the ACE2 receptor. The only mAb potently bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein did not compete with the RBD for binding to the ACE2 receptor, suggesting it bound a different, conserved site on the protein 91 . Similar studies were conducted to study changes in MERS-CoV. Five recombinant RBD proteins were constructed with mutations detected from MERS-CoV strains isolated in humans (2012-2015) and camels 92 . These RBDs maintained functionality and induced potent neutralizing antibodies. When residues in their receptor binding motifs were mutated to evade neutralization, cross-reactivity persisted but binding affinity to DPP-4 (the main receptor for MERS-CoV) was lost, suggesting limited antigenic escape for MERS-CoV. A study of MERS-CoV isolates with distinct amino acid differences in the S and other replication proteins found differences in replication kinetics, but it is not clear that these were attributable to differences in S 93 .",

A similar mechanism has been identified for seropositive and seronegative kittens infected with feline infectious peritonitis virus, a coronavirus that causes fatal disease in cats 97 . One study characterizing endemic HCoV in infants observed the highest lower respiratory tract infection burden (7.8%) at 6-23 months of age (1.5% at <6 months, close to none at 2-5 years) while upper respiratory tract infection burden was close to uniform 98 . The heightened disease burden after maternal immunity waning to medium levels in the lower tract, and the absence of such observation in the upper tract where antibodies do not circulate, subtly supports the possibility of ADE in HCoVs. 104 . Regarding regions of the spike protein that may induce antibodies with enhancement effects, both anti-S1a and anti-S1b mAbs showed mild to moderate effects 103 . Only one particular anti-S1b clone showed neutralization. No effect was seen for anti-N mAbs. There is limited evidence that these mechanisms are causal to inflammatory gene expression differences among patients with differing severities 105 .",

Presence of anti-S2 antibodies also increased the binding of immune cells (PBMCs) to A549 cells treated with IFN-, replicating the conditions under which a cytokine storm would be observed. A separate study demonstrated colocalization of anti-S2 Abs collected from serum of SARS patients \u226550 days post-fever onset with annexin A2 and immunoprecipitated annexin A2 on A549 cell surfaces. Elevated expression of annexin A2 on the surface can be stimulated by IL-6 and IFN-, both cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-1, which in turn increases binding of anti-S2 Abs to the cell. However, its pathogenic role was not explored 107 . Alternatively, similarity between viral and host epitopes (molecular mimicry) can generate crossreactive antibodies. In mice 108 and humans 109 , there is evidence of anti-N antibodies that cross react with IL-11, an anti-inflammatory cytokine expressed in many tissues, including lung and bone marrow. The authors suggest high anti-N antibodies induced relatively early during infection may be involved in the thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia observed early in SARS-CoV-1 infection 108 .",

            "text": "We have presented a broad, comprehensive review of multiple aspects of the literature on antibody immunity to coronaviruses. We identified a number of key findings. The median time to detection was similar across different antibodies for SARS-CoV-1 (12 days; IQR 8-15.2 days) and SARS-CoV-2 (11 days; IQR 7.25-14 days), but longer for MERS-CoV (16 days; IQR 13-19 days). Most long-term studies found that IgG waned over time (typically detectable up to at least a year) while others found detectable levels of IgG three years post symptoms onset. Antibody kinetics varied across the severity gradient with longer durations of detectable antibody associated with more severe symptoms. Human challenge studies with HCoV indicate that serum and mucosal immune responses (serum IgG, IgA, neutralizing titer, mucosal IgA) provide possible correlates of protection from infection and disease. However, repeat human challenge experiments with single HCoV suggest individuals can be infected with the same HCoV one year after first challenge, but with possible lower severity. There is cross-reactivity within but minimal reactivity between Alpha-and Beta-CoVs. While endemic HCoVs rarely induce cross-reactive antibodies against emerging HCoVs, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV stimulate antibodies induced by prior HCoV infections. Multiple mechanisms for immunopathology have been suggested but no strong causal evidence exists and the extent to which the presence of antibodies affects human disease severity is not known. Seroprevalence with the four major endemic HCoV strains rose rapidly during childhood and remained high in adults. The median age at first infection with any strain was 4.8 years (95% CI 2.5, 11.2). There was no clear trend in seroincidence with age, and many studies have demonstrated incidence of coronavirus infections in elderly populations. These results suggest a measurable impact of immunity to coronaviruses on future risk, but this protection may be transient.",

Further evidence on immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 is likely contained in work that has since been published. We excluded from the review animal studies and studies of animal CoVs to remain human-focused, but this literature is likely relevant to some areas of the review. We limited the scope of the review to antibodymediated immunity, meaning that understanding of some areas of the review may be incomplete. Finally, digitized data could be affected by publication bias or other selection bias, meaning that it might not be representative of data from all studies. The aim of the pooled analyses was to summarize the array of studies rather than formally explore hypotheses, and as a result the models used are simple. For example, in estimating force of infection from age-stratified seroprevalence data, we did not consider other features of a model such as assay sensitivity, time-and age-varying force of infections, seroreversion, and cross-reactivity between strains, that might better explain patterns seen in the data.",

Results for MERS-CoV are taken across studies in which a cutoff for the assay being used was provided, and gives the number of patients for which IgG levels were above the respective cutoffs, at different time points (also see Figure 4 ). For example, at week 26, there were 12 patients with mild symptoms from studies that reported a cutoff, and 8 of those patients had IgG levels above that cutoff. MERS-CoV data were digitised from six studies 35 Figure 1 : Aspects of antibody response included in this review. This figure shows the areas of focus of our review within our conceptualisation of the stages of exposure and infection at which we believe antibody mediated immunity may play a role in the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. At the individual level (left), antibody response following the first infection/exposure increases and then declines (Antibody kinetics). Sometime later individuals may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 again. They may be protected from infection by their acquired immunity (Correlates of protection). Their acquired immunity may also moderate the severity of infection with some possibility that pre-existing immunity may lead to immunopathogenesis (relevant to both first and second exposure). These individual-level dynamics aggregate to form the population-level seroprevalence (right-top). Measures of seroprevalence may imperfectly measure past exposure to infection due to antigenic diversity of future SARS-CoV-2 viruses and cross-reactivity of endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) with SARS-CoV-2. Measures of seroprevalence may also be inconsistent across times as antibodies-levels within individuals wane.",

Though replication is observed after entry, the virus does not exit nor alter the expression of proinflammatory immune mediators (CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1 , CXCL10/IP-10, TNF-) and apoptosis inducing ligands (FasL) 101 . This contrasts with effects in nonhuman primate studies where endocytosis into macrophages stimulated inflammation, which in turn drove severe lung injuries 102 . A study by another group in human promonocyte cell line (HL-CZ), which expresses both ACE2 and Fc--RII, demonstrated increased infectivity and virus-induced apoptosis when anti-SARS-CoV-1 sera from patients were added at 100-to 2000-fold dilutions, while at higher concentrations neutralization occurred 103 .
