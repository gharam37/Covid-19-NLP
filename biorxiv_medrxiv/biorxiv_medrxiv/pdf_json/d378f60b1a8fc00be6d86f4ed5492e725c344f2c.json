            "text": "Background: Despite efforts aimed at forecasting the course of the pandemic extrapolating from reports of the early onset in Wuhan, China, heterogeneity in the transmission seems to be an important characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 between countries. The study of the progress of the disease with a single set of transmission parameters is complicated by the application of different levels of containment measures at different stages of the pandemic. Methods: We studied the variation in transmission of COVID-19 globally and individually for 18 countries. We developed a piecewise fitting methodology to model the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic for a set of countries with a number of confirmed infections in excess of 1000 cases. Our study uses the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model to assess the contagious contact rate (\u03b2) of SARS-CoV-2 at different stages of the pandemic as a metric of the effectiveness of policies aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19. We extrapolate the results of our fittings to evaluate the effect of a reduction of \u03b2 on the level of burden laid on local health care infrastructure considering different levels of intervention and to estimate the maximum number of cases and potential peak date to inform future public health interventions. Results: According to the current trend, we project that the peak in the number of infections worldwide will take place after the third quarter of 2020. For 12 out of the 17 countries analyzed, the projections suggest that the number of severe infections will surpass the healthcare capacity. Additionally, it is observed that 4 out of the 17 analyzed will undergo a significant delay in the peak of the infection for a 90% reduction of the transmission rate, and thus extending the course of the epidemic further than the 365 day simulation window.

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) emerged in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019. Early situation reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) database indicated that most of the regions with more than a thousand cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited an exponential progression in the number of cases after the first three weeks of the first confirmed case. 1 The first reports of the epidemic suggested an alarming death rate of ~3%, which has increased with the time up to more than 5% 2 . As of April 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has globally reached more than 1,350,000 confirmed cases and 80,000 deaths 3 . However, the lethality rate and the number of confirmed cases notably differs between countries, 2 indicating distinct effects on the disease severity and transmission rate. Recent reports from Chinese COVID-19 cases have provided valuable information at the early stages of the epidemic and thus a general guidance to control the propagation within China has been considered in other countries. 4, 5 The control measures aimed at reducing the contact rate, such as social distancing policies and isolation of infected populations, have proven to be effective in managing the epidemic. Nevertheless, difficulties in the implementation of strict measures have led to a fast increase in the number of cases. 6, 7 For instance, Europe and the US have surpassed the number of fatalities in China despite the strict policies on social distancing that were adopted weeks ago. Due to the heterogeneity of the spread, it is expected that the healthcare systems of most economies will face a considerable burden in the coming months because of the COVID- 19 outbreak. 8 In the present circumstance of the COVID-19 spread, understanding of the dynamics of this epidemic is necessary to forecast and control the transmission of the disease, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of potential interventions in modifying its degree of infectiousness. 5 In particular, the first report for the transmissibility of COVID-19 estimated a basic reproduction number (R) ranging from 2.24 to 3.58 based on the time series of two other well-known coronavirus diseases (MERS and SARS). 9 However, the main goal of several studies was focused on the prediction of the trend of the epidemic as it expanded across mainland China, limiting the comparability of disease courses worldwide. Despite considerable efforts to model COVID-19 epidemic courses, the local dynamics of transmission is currently not well described for other countries.",

The parameter is hard to estimate accurately because the transmission rate can be altered by public policies. Hence, its value can range several orders of magnitude, mostly depending on the government response to contain the outbreak locally. For the Wuhan case, early reports 23 estimated a value of 0.064 at the initial stage of the spread but it further leaps to 0.322 after clinical support was adopted in the modelling. On the other hand, the recovery and latency rates ( and , respectively) are not directed by population controls; according to empirical data it was shown that these rates could range in the order of days (from 2 to 14 days) 24, 25 . Because of this, we impose restrictions on the possible values that these fitted parameters can take for predictions. We set the bounds for the fitted parameters as follows: 1/ \u220a [0,10], 1/ \u220a ",

Austria and South Korea are additional examples of public health measures, which have effectively curbed the total number of cases and reduced the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. 37, 38 Additional modelling efforts are required to retrospectively assess the effect of social distancing in curbing the pandemic; nevertheless, our results show that most countries in which social distancing has been implemented show a decrease in the rate of contact transmission. Moreover, the latter likely indicates that those countries with early phases of spread will also experience longterm benefits with more strict policies. Notably, our analyses show that stringent decreases in contact transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could lower the healthcare stress, and decrease the number of total cases. However, depending on the local progress of the pandemic, even a stringent reduction in could have the effect of either shortening the length of the disease, or prolong the time to reach the peak number of infections. The relevance of decreasing the contagious contact rate stems from the fact that the lethality could be exacerbated once the number of severe cases exceeds the healthcare capacity. 39 With respect to mobility, the citywide quarantine at Wuhan since January 23, 2020, had negligible effect on the epidemic trajectories for the rest of the country. 4 A 50% reduction in inter-city mobility leads to a negligible effect on epidemic dynamics. 4 Therefore, we concluded that accounting for inter-city and inter-country mobility in modeling countries where the epidemic is already present is not of main importance and could be mostly neglected. Given the heterogeneity of the COVID-19 pandemic, our projections should be helpful in understanding the effect of reducing under different circumstances.",

In this study, a multinational SEIR modeling considering three different epidemiological stages was used to compare the COVID-19 spreading dynamics. This allowed us to identify the effectiveness of the containment measures across 18 countries and determine the potential burden to the healthcare system, under the assumption of different levels of reduction of the contagious contact rate. Our estimations for the number of active infections place the global peak after the third quarter of 2020; however, several countries may experience a sharper decline within the coming weeks. We found that the peak number of infections monotonically decreases with the decrease in the contagious contact rate. Nevertheless, there is a mixed outcome in the duration of the epidemic since for some countries, the implementation of even more stringent containment measures would lead to a prolonged development of the COVID-19 epidemic. For all studied countries a 90% reduction in the contagious contact rate is required to avoid an excessive burden on the health care capacity. COVID-19 exhibits a heterogeneous spread for the countries studied, a fact that can be related to variations in both timing and efficacy with which the containment measures were implemented in each country. Our results provide informative guidelines to avoid healthcare overcapacity and weigh the long-term effects of more lenient policies. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

However, an underestimation in the number of active infections arising from the use of potentially under-sampled data 42 could lead to offsets in our forecasted peak date and in the expected number of peak infections. A second limitation of our approach is that, in contrast with Bayesian models, no prior distribution for constraining the parameter values to a credible interval is used when fitting the models; this might decrease the precision of the estimations in countries with limited data due to a lag in the pandemic's spread. Because the parameters model were unconstrained to some extent (see Methods), the basic reproductive number obtained for some countries do not precisely agree with other reports for the early onset (see the Supplementary Information). We emphasize the interpretation on the variations in the parameter values between countries and mainly across different stages as defined based on the time intervals that best fitted the SEIR model (i.e., those used in the piecewise methodology).",
