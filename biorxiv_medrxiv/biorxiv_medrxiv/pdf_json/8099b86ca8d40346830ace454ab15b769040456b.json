The authorities in different countries carry out mortality counts. We propose that the mortality reported in each country can be used to create an index of the number of actual cases at a given time. The specificity of whether or not deaths are rapid or not by COVID-19 also affects the number of actual cases. The number of days between the declaration of illness and death varies between 12 and 18 days. For a delay of 18 days, and using an estimated mortality rate of 2%, the number of cases in April 2020 in Tunisia would be 5 580 people. The pessimistic scenario predicts 22 320 infected people, and the most optimistic predicts 744 (which is the number of reported cases on April 12, 2020). Modeling the occurrence of COVID-19 cases is critical to assess the impact of policies to prevent the spread of the virus.",

It represents the epidemic transmission in Tunisia (see Figure 1 ). The first case was detected on March 2 th 2020. According to dataset t = 0 of the epidemic corresponds to 20 February. In [8] the epidemiological characteristics of patients are studied, and all patients who die on a given day have been infected much earlier, so the denominator of the fatality rate should be the total number of patients infected at the same time as those who died [9] . This is especially true as the rates of progression of the pandemic evolve differently in different countries: in April 2020, the number of people affected was increasing sharply from day to day in France, while it had stabilized in China.

For example, for Tunisia on April 12, P 18 = 3.6, while on March 25, 2020, when regulation of progression rate based on population containment was still not fully efficient, P 18 = 127. We can therefore estimate that the containment made it possible to reduce P 18 from 127 to 3.6. The number of cases estimated on April 12 using P 18 = 175 would have been 26 246 cases (with T = 15%).

For this outbreak, the unreported cases and the disease transmission rate are not identified. In order to recover these values from reported medical data, this simple mathematical model for estimating the COVID-19 cases is used. The knowledge of the cumulative reported symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious cases and assuming the infectious delay until death to be between 12 days and 18 days, this model estimates the number of infected cases. Then numerical simulations of the model are done to predict forward in time the severity of the epidemic, with adjusted data. We find that the most pessimistic number of infected people is 22 320 and the most optimistic is 744 at April 12 th , 2020, and when the mortality rate is equal to 2%, the estimation number is equal to 5 580 (the number of reported cases at this date is 707 people).",

What is significant, in Tunisia and also in France, is that the public authorities are becoming aware of the necessity to properly quantify the number of deaths. This work raises interesting questions about the relation between the fatality rate and the number of infected cases. Our model used a mortality rate of 2% while several international studies reported rates of 0.7 to 3.6% [10] . Values from 0.5 to 4% could thus be other reasonable options to estimate mortality rate. One of the limitations of our model is that mortality rates can change from one country to another, depending on the distribution of the population in different age groups and on the co-morbidity that have different sensitivities to Covid-19. In the other hand, the ability of the virus to persist in different environments (hot climate) can affect this relation. Hence the importance of comparisons between countries with more and less sunshine, at different seasons and periods.",
