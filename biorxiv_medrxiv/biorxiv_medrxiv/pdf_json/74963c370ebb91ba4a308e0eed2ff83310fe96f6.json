Focusing limited public health resources on transmission hotspots can contain spread, thus reducing morbidity and mortality, but rapid data on community-level disease dynamics is often unavailable. Here, we demonstrate an approach to identify anomalously elevated levels of influenza-like illness (ILI) in real-time, at the scale of US counties. Leveraging data from a geospatial network of thermometers encompassing more than one million users across the US, we identify anomalies by generating accurate, county-specific forecasts of seasonal ILI from a point prior to a potential outbreak and comparing real-time data to these expectations. Anomalies are strongly correlated with COVID-19 case counts and may provide an early-warning system to locate outbreak epicenters.",

Data from these networks are typically less specific, but more sensitive, than formal surveillance, and are often available more rapidly, because formal surveillance is constrained by testing speed (5) and/or time for record aggregation (8). Data from syndromic monitoring networks can be physiologically grounded in disease processes (e.g. fever), in contrast with internet-based proxies, such as search engine logs, that are often used as a substitute for real-time syndromic data (9) . Physiological data from connected devices, such as thermometer data, or elevated heart-rate data (10) , are thus a potentially valuable resource for outbreak response, and, at present, may be able to detect COVID-19 symptoms in the absence of widespread and rapid testing in the US.",

We then use the method to identify COVID-19 outbreaks in the continental United States. Our anomaly detection method follows three core steps: 1) Generate county-specific forecasts of influenza-like illness (ILI) from a time point prior to a potential outbreak, 2) compare real-time thermometer-derived ILI to forecast expectations when new data is aggregated daily, and 3) flag anomalous ILI values by evaluating the probability that the current signal is driven by regular seasonal influenza. In this case, we flag ILI values that exceed the 97.5% percentile of expected influenza trajectories.",

As population size and climate change relatively slowly from year-to-year, this allows the use of the county-specific, daily network data to learn the typical seasonal flu transmission patterns of a region. From this we construct local ILI forecasts that form the basis for real-time anomaly detection.

We flag anomalous ILI when the daily, real-time data exceeds the 97.5% percentile of the expected influenza forecast ensemble. We define anomaly incidence as the difference between the real-time thermometer ILI and the 97.5% percentile drawn from the influenza forecast ensemble. To validate this method, we apply our approach to detect COVID-19 anomalies by forecasting expected influenza starting on March 1 st , 2020, before widespread outbreaks were underway (2). We assess detection quality by comparing anomaly fever counts to state-and county-level COVID-19 confirmed cases aggregated from a variety of government sources (15) .",

To calculate these forecast error rates, we compare CMU forecasts to CDC ILI, while comparing anomaly detection forecasts to thermometer-based ILI, given that these models are trained on different data sources. In contrast to other ILI forecasts, our models do not need to be initialized with now-cast predictions, (i.e. inferred initial conditions) as thermometer-based ILI, upon which the model is trained, is available in real-time. Additionally, our forecast errors do not appear to increase much past the 5-week forecast horizon, suggesting the ILI forecasts in the anomaly detection system are stable at long-time horizons (Fig. 1A) . Forecast error rates display seasonality, where forecasting errors are higher in winter months during periods of increased illness incidence, and lower in the spring and summer (Fig. S1 ).",

Specifically, we find significant correlations between total confirmed COVID-19 cases and total fever anomalies at the county (Fig. 1B: r = 0 .54, P < 0.0001) and state scales ( Fig. 1C : r = 0.55, P < 0.0001). We restrict this analysis to counties with at least one confirmed COVID-19 case, given that a lack of confirmed cases could be due to either true COVID-19 patterns or an absence of testing and reporting. We do not observe anomalous fevers in three states where COVID-19 cases are confirmed; Minnesota, Wisconsin, and South Dakota.

We are thus likely underestimating anomaly incidence after social distancing is enacted, given that our model assumes typical seasonal influenza transmission patterns. We therefore explore the sensitivity of our method by reducing R t values used in the influenza forecast for all days after social distancing efforts were implemented. In Brooklyn NY ( Fig. 2A) , dropping future R t values by 25% reduces the trajectory of seasonal influenza, leading to an increased magnitude of anomaly incidence ( Fig.   2A ). In Santa Clara County, without accounting for social distancing we observe only a short period of detected anomalies, where real-time ILI falls below the expected range of seasonal influenza (Fig. 1F) . Here, reducing R t following the 'shelter-in-place' order leads to additional anomaly detections post-social distancing (Fig. 2B) . Similarly, following school closures in Miami-Dade County, real-time ILI values fell below anomalous levels by late March (Fig. S2) , though accounting for reduced influenza transmission leads to more anomaly detections (Fig.   2C ). In these case examples, we assumed R reduced by 25% given social distancing directives.",

For each county, we estimate the median R t for each day-of-year by first calculating daily R t for back to August 1, 2016. We then forecast ILI forward from March 1 st , 2020, by using the median R t corresponding to day t, to estimate I t+1 and forward propagate these predictions 12weeks (84 days) ahead. We generate an ensemble of 100 influenza predictions by inserting Gaussian noise into the starting values of effective incidence at the point of prediction. The scale of noise varies across regions, determined from the residual ILI after detrending the past time series using a two-week centered, rolling mean. See Methods for more detail on the nation-wide and region-specific implementations of this approach.",
