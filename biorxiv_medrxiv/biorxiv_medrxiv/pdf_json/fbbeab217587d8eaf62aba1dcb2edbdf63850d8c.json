If case reports were excluded, the sensitivity in case series was 96% (95% CI, 0.93-0.99). The sensitivity of CT scan in confirmed patients under 18 years old was only 66% (95% CI, 0.11-1.00). The most common imaging manifestation was ground-glass opacities (GGO) which was found in 75% (95% CI, 0.68-0.82) of the patients. The pooled probability of bilateral involvement was 84% (95% CI, 0.81-0.88). The most commonly involved lobes were the right lower lobe (84%, 95% CI, 0.78-0.90) and left lower lobe (81%, 95% CI, 0.74-0.87). The quality of evidence was low across all outcomes.

As a respiratory disease, imaging detection plays an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19. On one hand, when COVID-19 cannot be diagnosed by nucleic acid, CT can be used as an auxiliary diagnostic method; on the other hand, CT can show lesions and also plays an important role in patient follow-up. Since February 2020, several case-control studies (8, 9) , case series (10, 11) , and case-report (12, 13) of CT diagnosis of COVID-19 have been published. However, there is no systematic review and meta-analysis to find out the performance of chest CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19.
