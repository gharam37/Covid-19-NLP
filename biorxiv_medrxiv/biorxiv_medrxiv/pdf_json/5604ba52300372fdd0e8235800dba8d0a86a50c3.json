Because both viruses are RNA virus depending on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to replicate, the RdRp inhibitor Arbidol (common name for Umifenovir) approved for influenza in Russia and China has been proposed as a standard care option for COVID-19, mainly based on its mechanism-of-action (MoA) and its effects in treating influenza-associated pneumonia. [5] [6] [7] Favipiravir, an antiviral drug targeting RdRP, 8 approved in Japan for influenza, has an IC50 of 0.013-0.48 ug/ml for influenza A. Comparing this with the EC50 of 2.7-13.8 ug/ml of Arbidol, 9 we consider Favipiravir might serve as a potential candidate to treat COVID-19. Specifically, we hypothesized that Favipiravir would be superior to Arbidol in terms of improving clinical recovery rate at Day 7, and alleviating pyrexia, cough, and ARDS.

Although Chinese guideline had recommended several options including Arbidol, 11 no RCT results on these drugs were reported. Arbidol was widely used by Chinese doctors in the beginning stage of this epidemic of COVID-19 (Jan. 1-30, 2020) based on in vitro evidence. 12 For ethical reasons, we chose Arbidol for the control arm. Secondly, observation time frame was limited due to the urgency of this epidemic. For the same reason, no relapse (including nucleic acid conversion, pyrexia, cough, or pneumonia progress by radiology) tracking were performed for the discharged patients. Thirdly, in the inclusion criteria, we did not force positive nucleic acid test as a necessity. The accuracy of nucleic acid assay was limited, which might due to multiple reasons including previous treatment, latency of onset, sampling method, biological specimen characteristics. This particular accuracy problem was a known issue among clinical practitioners across the world. It was estimated that the assay might have at most 30%-50% of sensitivity for patients in early stage of the disease, whilst contact history, clinical manifestations, radiology evidences, and lab results including leukopenia and lymphopenia could be confirmatory for these nucleic-acid-negative pneumonia patients.

At Day 7, 62/120 (51.67%) in the Arbidol group and 71/116 (61.21%) patients in the Favipiravir group (P=0.1396) were clinically recovered (difference of recovery rate (DRR): 0.0954, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.0305~0.2213) (Figure 2). Hence, we conclude that Favipiravir does not show superior efficacy compared to Arbidol in terms of improving the clinical recovery rate at Day 7. Post-hoc test for interaction between treatment and clinical classification showed no interaction between these two factors, both of which contributed to the primary outcome (P=0.017 for treatment, and P<0.001 for clinical classification, with a general linear model). A post-hoc analysis found that for moderate patients with COVID-19, clinical recovery of Day 7 was 62/111 (55.86%) in the Arbidol group and 70/98 (71.43%) in the Favipiravir group (P=0.0199) (DRR: 0.1557, 95% CI: 0.0271~0.2843); for severe/critical patients, clinical recovery rate was 0/9 (0%) in the Arbidol group and 1/18 (5.56%) in the Favipiravir group (P=0.4712) (DRR: 0.0556, 95% CI: -0.0503~0.1614).Comparison of duration of pyrexia, cough relief time and auxiliary oxygen therapy or noninvasive mechanical ventilation rate All rights reserved.

Whilst the incidence of pyrexia and cough did not differ between two groups at baseline, both the latency to pyrexia reduction and cough relief in the Favipiravir group was significantly shorter than that in the Arbidol group (P<0.0001) (Figure 3). The incidence of de novo auxiliary oxygen therapy (AOT) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NMV) was 27/120 (22.50%) in the Arbidol group and 21/116 (18.10%) in the Favipiravir group (P=0.4015) (DRR: -4.40%, 95% CI: -14.64%~5.85%).

However, it did significantly improve the latency to cough relief and decreased the duration of pyrexia. Favipiravir was not associated with any differences in ICU admission, AOT/NMV, dyspnea, respiratory failure or all-cause mortality. Interestingly, post-hoc observation showed that a trend of Favipiravir being effective to improve clinical recovery rate at Day 7 in moderate COVID-19 patients compared to Arbidol. This effect diminished for severe/critical COVID-19 patients. Additionally, post-hoc analysis showed that for moderate COVID-19 patients, Favipiravir was associated with decreased auxiliary oxygen therapy or noninvasive mechanical ventilation rate with marginal significance (P=0.0541). Finally, in the FAS, post-hoc analysis also showed that Favipiravir treatment significantly decreased de novo incidences of dyspnea. Whether Favipiravir would be only effective for moderate COVID-19 patients, or could Favipiravir be used to prevent disease progression, is a question warrant future investigation.",

A total of 240 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were recruited from the three hospitals (120 from ZNWU, 88 from LSS, and 32 from HBTH). Patients receive either Favipiravir (1600mg, twice first day followed by 600mg, twice daily, for the following days) or Arbidol (200mg, three times daily) plus standard care for 7 days. The treatment could be extended to 10 days at judgement of the researchers. Standard care could comprise, as for the patient's best interest, traditional Chinese herbal medicine, antibiotics, additional antiviral treatment, immunomodulatory drugs, steroids, psychotic drugs, nutrition support, cardiovascular drugs, supportive oxygen, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) or invasive ventilation. Randomized open label (1:1 ratio between Arbidol and Favipiravir) was produced by professional statistical software SAS (version 9.4) and assigned to patients.
