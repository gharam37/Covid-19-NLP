Early imposition of stringent border measures, high levels of testing, active case-finding and quarantine of contacts have all bought time to reinforce public health and clinical capacity. However, a recent influx of cases among travelers returning from countries with rapidly growing epidemics has been associated with establishment of community transmission in several Australian states.

This framework was initially developed for influenza pandemic preparedness (10) , and has been modified to estimate health care requirements for COVID-19 patients and inform needed service expansion. The ability of different sectors to meet anticipated demand was assessed by modelling plausible COVID-19 epidemic scenarios, overlaid on available capacity and models of patient flow and care delivery. An unmitigated outbreak is anticipated to completely overwhelm the system. Given realistic limits on capacity expansion, these models have made the case for ongoing case targeted measures, combined with broader social restrictions, to reduce transmission and 'flatten the curve' of the local epidemic to preserve health sector continuity.",

Transmission parameters were based on information synthesis from multiple sources, with an assumed R0 of 2.53, and a doubling time of 6.4 days (Table 1) . Potential for pre-symptomatic transmission was assumed within 48 hours prior to symptom onset. While there is an increasing body of evidence regarding requirements of hospitalised patients for critical care, considerable uncertainty remains regarding the full 'pyramid' of mild and moderately symptomatic disease. We therefore simulated a range of scenarios using Latin Hypercube Sampling from distributions in which the proportion of all infections severe enough to require hospitalisation ranged between 4.3 and 8.6%. These totals represent the aggregate of strongly age-skewed parameter assumptions (Table 2) . For each scenario, corresponding distributions of mild cases presenting to primary care were sampled, ranging from 30-45% at the lower range of the 'severe' spectrum, to 50-75% for the most extreme case (increasing linearly between the two). Cases not presenting to the health system were assumed 'undetected' without differentiation between those with mild or no symptoms.",

Cases were isolated at the point of diagnosis (assumed 48 hours after symptom onset), limiting the effective infectious period and reducing infectiousness by 80%. Targeted quarantine of close contacts was implemented in the model framework by dynamic assignment of a transient 'contact' label. Each time a new infectious case appears in the model, a fixed number of temporary 'contacts' are labelled. Only contacts can progress through the exposed and infectious states, however the majority remain uninfected and return to their original 'non-contact' status within 72 hours. We assumed that 80% of identified contacts adhered to quarantine measures and that the overall infectiousness of truly exposed and infected contacts was halved by quarantine, given delayed and imperfect contact tracing and the risk of transmission to household members.",

At baseline, we assume that half of available consulting and admission capacity across all sectors and services is available to COVID-19 patients. Mild cases present to primary care until capacity is exceeded. Severe cases access the hospital system through ED and from there are triaged to a ward or ICU bed according to need, if available. Requirements for critical care are assumed to increase steeply with age with the consequence that about 60% of all infections requiring ICU admission occur in individuals aged 70 years and over ( Table 2) . As ward beds reach capacity, the ability of emergency departments to triage patients is reduced because of bed block, meaning that not all patients who need care are medically assessed, although some will still be able to access primary care. The model allows for repeat representations within and between primary care and hospital services, and progression from ward to intensive care, with length of stay as shown ( Table 2 ). Model structure and assumptions are based on publicly available data on the Australian health care system, and expert elicitation. Full model details are provided in Supplementary material.",

As a result, the proportion of critical cases that can access care is greatly increased. Transmission reduction of 33% makes treatment of all cases achievable in the majority of simulations if three to fivefold ICU bed capacity can be achieved (Supplementary figure 1B) .

As public health response capacity is exceeded, greater constraint of disease spread will be essential to ensure that feasible levels of expansion in available health care can maintain ongoing system functions, including care of COVID-19 patients. Broader based social and physical distancing measures reduce the number of potential contacts made by each case, minimising public health workload and supporting sustainable case targeted disease control efforts.",

There is also marked variability globally in the definition of 'intensive care', even within high-income countries where the descriptor covers many levels of ventilatory and other support. The authors concur with our conclusion that social distancing measures to suppress disease are required to save lives.

Such facilities have additional benefits of ensuring appropriate testing, in line with local case definitions, and reduce the overall consumption of personal protective equipment by cohorting likely infectious patients.

The clinical pathways model assumes that half of available bed capacity is available for patients with the disease but does not anticipate the seasonal surge in influenza admissions that may be overlaid with the epidemic peak, although even in our most recent severe season (2017) only 6% of hospital beds were occupied by influenza cases (16) . Available beds will likely be increased by other factors such as secondary reductions in all respiratory infections and road trauma resulting from social restrictions, and purposive decisions to cancel non-essential surgery. Importantly, we do not consider health care worker absenteeism due to illness, carer responsibilities or burnout -all of which are anticipated challenges over a very prolonged epidemic accompanied by marked social disruption. We also cannot account for shortages in critical medical supplies as the true extent of these and their likely future impacts on service provision are presently unknown. 7 The model indicates that a combination of case-targeted and social measures will need to be applied over an extended period to reduce the rate of epidemic growth. In reality, it is likely that the stringency of imposed controls, their public acceptability and compliance will all vary over time. In Australia, compliance with isolation and self-quarantining was largely on the basis of trust in early response (February through March) but active monitoring and enforcement of these public health measures is now occurring in many jurisdictions. Hong Kong and Singapore initiated electronic monitoring technologies from the outset to track the location of individuals and enforce compliance (17). Proxy indicators of compliance such as transport and mobile phone data have informed understanding of the impact of social and movement restrictions on mobility and behaviour in other settings (11) , and will be further investigated in the Australian context.",

Estimates of the local effective reproduction number will enable forecasting of epidemic trajectories (18) to be fed into the analysis pathway presented here. Anticipated case numbers will be used to assess the ability to remain within health system capacity represented by the clinical pathways model, given current levels of social intervention.
