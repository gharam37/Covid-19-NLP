However, the exact molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remain largely unknown. We exploited an integrated proteomics approach to systematically investigate intra-viral and virus-host interactomes for the identification of unrealized SARS-CoV-2 host targets and participation of cellular proteins in the response to viral infection using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from COVID-19 patients. Using this approach, we elucidated 251 host proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 and more than 200 host proteins that are significantly perturbed in COVID-19 derived PBMCs. From the interactome, we further identified that non-structural protein nsp9 and nsp10 interact with NKRF, a NF-kB repressor, and may precipitate the strong IL-8/IL-6 mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and overexuberant host inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients. Our integrative study not only presents a systematic examination of SARS-CoV-2-induced perturbation of host targets and cellular networks to reflect disease etiology, but also reveals insights into the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers cytokine storms and represents a powerful resource in the quest for therapeutic intervention.",

            "text": "Limited by their relatively small genomes, viral proteins form different combinations of protein complexes to fulfill a variety of critical functions during viral life cycle, making the investigation of intra-viral protein-protein interactions (PPIs) a requirement. To systematically characterize the intra-viral PPI networks, both genome-wide yeast-two hybrid (Y2H) screens and co-immunoprecipitations (co-IP) experiments with SARS-CoV-2 genes were performed. All the predicted viral genes were synthesized based on the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate (GenBank: MN908947). The entire library was cloned into Y2H DNA-binding domain (pACT2) and activation domain (pGBTK7) vectors and then transformed into the Y2HGold yeast strain (Clontech). Nsp3 was truncated into two smaller fragments in this experiment since large genes tend to yield fewer interactions in the Y2H assay. All the possible pair-wise combinations were examined independently for the activation of the reporter genes HIS3 and ADE2 in triplicates. We captured 19 PPIs from the Y2H screens, including nsp15-nsp2, ORF7b-nsp1, N-nsp4, ORF3a-nsp4, ORF7b-nsp7, nsp7-nsp8, nsp12-nsp8, nsp7-nsp9, nsp14-nsp10, nsp16-nsp10, ORF6-nsp14, E-E, N-E, ORF3a-E, ORF9b-E, N-N, nsp7-ORF7a, nsp8-ORF8, and ORF9b-ORF9b (Extended Data Fig.1) . The Co-IP assay resulted in the identification of 52 PPIs (Extended Data Fig.1-2) . Some of the interactions between viral proteins, such as the association between nsp12 and nsp8, were detected by both Y2H and co-IP. Some viral proteins, such as M, N, E, nsp2, nsp5, nsp8, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF9b, and ORF10 displayed self-association, suggesting their dimer or oligomer forms may carry out important functions during infection. In total, we characterized 58 distinct intra-viral PPIs amongst 28 SARS-CoV-2 genes that may promote virus replication and can be expected to be important to immune evasion and viral pathogenesis.

In addition, nsps can function as virulence factors that inhibit the host's immune system defenses. We speculate that the relatively large number of nsp interactions detected (12) might imply a crucial role of nsps in the formation of multimeric complexes during the viral life cycle (Fig.1c) . The SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab (the precursor of all 16 nsps) shares 94.4% amino acid identity to SARS-CoV ORF1ab. A number of structural studies posits the methyltransferase activity of SARS-CoV nsp14 or nsp16 are facilitated by nsp10-nsp14 and nsp10-nsp16 associations, respectively 16, 17 , which are also observed in SARS-CoV-2. Thus, our intra-viral PPI network provides the foundation to dissect the role of these viral proteins in mediating the synthesis, assembly and processing of viral proteins for both SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related SARS-CoV. Disruption of these intra-viral PPIs by repurposing small molecule or peptide drugs that target specific epitopes can be a treatment strategy against COVID-19 18 .",

We overexpressed the plasmids encoding each SARS-CoV-2 encoded gene with N-terminal 3xFlag-epitope in HEK293 cells and purified each SARS-CoV-2 protein complex by affinity purification. Co-purified cellular proteins were subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (AP-LC-MS). From AP-LC-MS analysis, 251 cellular proteins were identified to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, resulting in 631 high-confidence interactions ( Fig.2 and Table 1 ). We identified previously reported proteins that had bona fide associations with SARS-CoV proteins, such as ROA0 and subunits of the ATPase (AT1A1 and AT1A2) 19 , further substantiating these cellular processes as vital targets of the coronavirus family. SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins also interacts with the subunits of 40S ribosomal proteins (RS5, RS10, RS12, RS14, RS17, RS18, and RS27), T complex proteins (TCPA, TCPD, TCPE, TCPG, TCPH, TCPQ, and TCPZ), and proteasome-related proteins (PRS4, PRS7, PRS8, PSA, PSA4, PSA6, PSA7, PSD11, PSD13, PSMD1, PSMD2, PSMD6, and PSMD7). These viral-cellular protein interactions might have extensive cytopathic effects on the host cell, often altering host gene translation, protein folding, and degradation pathways during viral infection to assist viral growth and proliferation (Extended Data Fig.3a-b) . The virus may also coopt the complex membranous network surrounding and residing within the host cell, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membranes, so long as the membrane systems possess host proteins that lead to a productive infection (Fig.2 ). Most importantly, the AP-LC-MS analysis uncovered host targets pertinent in inflammatory and innate immune responses, which may help explain the common respiratory symptoms. Key viral-cellular PPIs that may influence the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 include interaction between NKRF (an endogenous repressor of IL-8/IL-6 synthesis) and nsp9/nsp10/nsp12/nsp13/nsp15 20,21 , C1QBP (involved in complement C1 activation) and nsp9/nsp10 22 , G3BP2 (anti-viral stress granule protein) and N 23 , and RAE1 (an interferon-inducible mRNA nuclear export protein) and ORF6 24 . These observations provide an overview of host proteins or pathways that are modulated by SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and these PPIs might serve as potential targets for drug development or repurposing against COVID-19.",

LBP positively regulates neutrophil response upon LPS stimulation and MMP25 inactivates alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor to facilitate the trans-endothelial migration of neutrophil to inflammatory sites during infection 27, 28 . These differentially expressed proteins support a model by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers cytokine release, such as IL-8, in the early stage of infection, resulting in uncontrolled infiltration and activation of neutrophils to the sites of infection followed by eventual progression to cytokine storm and respiratory distress. Indeed, laboratory results reveal increased neutrophils to ~90% of the white blood cell count as COVID-19 progresses to critical stages 11, 12 . The elevation of IL-8 and IL-6 but not IL-17 in PMBCs collected from COVID-19 patients indicates possible roles for IL-8/IL-6 in the severe inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.3d-e and Extended Data Fig.5e ).",

Therefore, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 virulence factors may potentiate or regulate the induction of IL-8/IL-6 during infection, leading to the uncontrolled infiltration and activation of neutrophils. NKRF is a transcriptional repressor that inhibit IL-8 and IL-6 induction by competing with NF-kB for promoter binding 20,21,29 . From our virus-host interactome, we discovered that NKRF interacts with SARS-CoV-2 nsp9, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp15 ( Fig.2 and Extended Data Fig.7a ). Among these SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, individually expressed nsp9 or nsp10 facilitated the induction of both IL-8 and IL-6 in lung epithelial A549 cells, while individually expressed nsp12, nsp13, or nsp15 had little or no effects (Fig. 3i-j) . The levels of TNFa was not affected by either nsp9 or nsp10 (Extended Data Fig.7b) , suggesting nsp9 and nsp10 does not affect NK-kB signaling transduction overall. Importantly, NKRF deficiency by specific siRNA facilitated the induction of IL-8 and diminished the effect of nsp10, indicating that nsp10 potentially targeted NKRF to regulate IL-8 induction (Extended Data Fig.7c-d) .",

To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize the PBMC proteome profile in both mild and severe cases of COVID-19, corroborating the overall clinical features of COVID-19 patients at molecular levels. These systematic analyses not only generate groundwork for future SARS-CoV-2 research on the nature of this virus but also provide valuable targets for specific drug development or repurposing. With these platforms, we identified nsp9 and nsp10 as the potential virulence factors for SARS-CoV-2, which interacts with NKRF to facilitate IL-8/IL-6 induction, ultimately leading to uncontrolled infiltration and activation of neutrophils (Fig.4) . Specific agents targeting IL-8/IL-6 or the downstream JAK kinases could be repurposed as suitable drug candidates for clinical evaluation. These small molecule inhibitors (i.e. IL-6 or IL-8 receptor antagonists) or agents blocking virulence factor PPIs would have enormous value as anti-virulence therapies in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections (Fig.4) .",

This study followed the Guideline of Novel Coronavirus Laboratory Safety (Edition 2) and was approved by Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (#YJ-2020-S052-02). The peripheral venous whole blood samples were collected from all the patients and PBMCs were prepared using density-gradient centrifugation followed by washing with cold PBS twice. The cell pellets were lysed by 8 Urea (in 20mM Tris-HCl with protein inhibitor cocktail and phosphor-STOP cocktail, pH 8.0) to denature the proteins and sonicated twice on ice to break the protein-protein or DNA-protein interactions. All the procedures were carried out within the certified laboratory for studies of infectious materials. Then protein samples were combined to generate 3 control samples from 6 healthy donors, 13 mild-case samples from 22 COVID-19-MS and 10 severe-case samples from 13 COVID-19-SS according to the protein concentrations of all the samples. The resulted protein soups were then applied for protein digestion for the following proteomic experiments.Protein Digestion: TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine, final concentration is 5 mM) (Thermo Scientific) and iodoacetamide (final concentration is 10mM) (Sigma) for reduction and alkylation were added to the solution and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes, respectively.
