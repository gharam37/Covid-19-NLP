In recent times, CRISPR based detection of nucleic acids has provided an economical and quicker alternative to sequencing-based platforms which are often difficult to implement in the field. Here, we present FnCas9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay (FELUDA) that employs a highly accurate enzymatic readout for detecting nucleotide sequences, identifying nucleobase identity and inferring zygosity with precision. We demonstrate that FELUDA output can be adapted to multiple signal detection platforms and can be quickly designed and deployed for versatile applications including rapid diagnosis during infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19. : bioRxiv preprint optimization for every variant and Cas13 requires conversion to an RNA template prior to detection, both of which increases the complexity and thus the time taken for diagnosis. Taken together, development of a detection pipeline based on a highly specific CRISPR protein with a direct binding or cleavage based readout can significantly increase the sensitivity of detection and reduce the time and cost of CRISPR based diagnostics (CRISPRDx), This is especially crucial for point-of-care (POC) applications where complex experimentation or setup of reaction components are not feasible.",

In recent times, CRISPR components have been successfully used for detecting a wide variety of nucleic acid targets such as those obtained from pathogenic microorganisms or disease-causing mutations from various biological specimens [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . At the heart of such a detection procedure lies the property of CRISPR proteins to accurately bind to target DNA or RNA, undergo conformational changes leading to cleavage of targets generating a reporter-based signal outcome [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . To enable such a detection mechanism to be foolproof, sensitive and reproducible across a large variety of targets, the accuracy of DNA interrogation and subsequent enzyme activity is extremely critical, particularly when clinical decisions are to be made based on these results 1,2 .",

Cleavage outcomes are then converted to a reporter-based readout with or without signal amplification. Among the CRISPR proteins that have been used so far, Cas9 and Cas12 or their inactive forms have been predominantly employed for detecting DNA sequences while Cas13 has been used for both DNA and RNA sequences. Each of these approaches has its own strengths and limitations that are related to sensitivity, specificity and read-out modes for an accurate diagnosis. The primary focus of these platforms is towards detection of low copy numbers of nucleic acids from body fluids of patients where signal amplification through collateral activity of fluorescent reporters has been proven to be advantageous.

We then fixed the position of this mutation with respect to PAM and changed every other base in the sgRNA sequence to identify which combination led to complete loss of cleavage of a wild type substrate in an in vitro cleavage (IVC) assay with FnCas9 ( Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 1A ). We found that two mismatches at the 2 nd and 6 th positions away from the PAM completely abrogated the cleavage of the target ( Figure 1B ). Similarly other combinations (2 and 7, 2 and 8, 2 and 9, and 2 and 12, numbers referring to positions away from PAM) also abolished the cleavage, although to slightly lower levels ( Figure 1B) . Notably, on the SCA substrate, the 2 and 6 mismatch combination produced near complete cleavage suggesting that this combination may be favorable for discriminating between WT and SCA substrates ( Figure 1B ). Figure 1B) . Taken together, these experiments suggest that FELUDA design can be universally used for detection of SNVs and and would not require extensive optimization or validation steps for new SNVs. To aid users for quick design and implementation of FELUDA for a target SNV, we have developed a webtool JATAYU (Junction for Analysis and Target Design for Your FELUDA assay) that incorporates the above features and generates primer sequences for amplicon and sgRNA synthesis (https:// jatayu.igib.res.in, Supplementary Figure 2 ). We next tested FELUDA in DNA from 6 SCA patients and a healthy control and found that in every case, the SC mutation containing substrates were cleaved to give a distinguishable signature while the WT substrate remained intact (Supplementary Figure 3A ). To establish that enzyme specificity for position-specific mismatches with respect to PAM site is the fundamental reason for this discrimination, we designed the mismatch combinations such that cleavage will occur only for the WT substrate and observed identical results thus confirming our hypothesis (Supplementary Figure   3B ). Notably, a simple agarose gel electrophoresis can be employed for this discrimination suggesting that FELUDA can be used in routine molecular biology labs to establish the presence of an SNV in a DNA sequence.",

We designed an assay using FAM labelled RNP complex and biotin labelled amplicons on commercially available paper strips. In such a reaction, RNP-bound substrate molecules in a solution can lead to aggregation of the complex on a distinct test line of the strip while anti-FAM antibody linked gold nanoparticles accumulate on a control line on the strip ( Figure   2C ). To enable FAM labelling of sgRNA, we first validated the successful activity of chimeric FnCas9 sgRNAs by altering the length of overlap between crRNA:tracrRNA and observed that 19nt overlap can efficiently cleave the target ( Figure 2D ). Since a single FAM labelled tracrRNA is compatible with multiple crRNAs, this design also reduces the time and cost of a FELUDA assay. Next, we performed this assay with the HBB target and were able to detect up to femtomolar levels of target DNA in a solution suggesting that even without signal amplification, FELUDA reaches sensitivity similar to that reported for CRISPRDx platforms employing collateral activity ( Figure 2E ). Finally, we tested FELUDA using WT and SCA samples and obtained clear distinguishing bands for either condition validating the feasibility of visual detection for FELUDA diagnostics with complete accuracy ( Figure 2F ).",

To detect the non-PAM proximal SNVs we designed an in-built PAM site in the amplification step of FELUDA. We tested this approach using 2 SNVs (A2142G and A2143G) present in Helicobacter pylori 23s rRNA gene and which do not have a NGG PAM in the vicinity. These SNVS confer variable clarithromycin resistance in patients with gastric ulcers and clinically pose a serious concern for physicians 26 . We validated that PAM-mer based amplification can be successfully used for FnCas9 based IVC by targeting synthetic DNA sequence containing the H. pylori 23s rRNA gene ( Figure 3C ). We then isolated bacteria DNA from patient gut biopsy samples FELUDA reaction. To overcome this, we explored single mismatches in the sgRNA sequence that might lead to abrogation of cleavage or binding from the substrate particularly at positions 16-19 at PAM distal end, since these showed minimum cleavage from our previous study. Remarkably, we found that FnCas9 shows negligible cleavage at each of these positions (Supplementary Figure 5A ). In particular, mismatch at PAM distal 16 th base shows complete absence of cleavage and negligible binding affinity to mismatched substrate ( Figure 3D ).

            "text": ". Using our single base pair mismatch approach we could successfully distinguish individuals with each of these genotypes (Supplementary Figure 5B). FELUDA detection can be customized with other features of current CRISPRDx methods such as detecting SNVs in RNA or compatibility with isothermal amplification of substrate 29 . At the level of RNA, by appending a Reverse Transcription (RT) step prior to amplification, we could successfully distinguish two Dengue virus serotypes (West Pac/74 and P23085, designated 1 and 2) that lead to variable mortality rates in patients (Supplementary Figure 6) 30,31 . To circumvent the need of complex instrumentation for preamplification, we optimized Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) for generating amplicons that can contribute to a field deployable assay prototype (Supplementary Figure 7A-B) 32 . Importantly, FELUDA detection can occur in a wide temperature range (10 o C -50 o C) and up to 3 days post thawing (at room temperature) suggesting that field studies using FELUDA can be conducted in diverse climatic conditions and reaction components can be successfully used following cold chain transportation (Supplementary Figure 8A-B). During the preparation of this manuscript, a sudden outbreak of Corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection broke out and has led to an ongoing public health emergency in most countries of the world. In addition to general social distancing, identification of infected individuals and screening their contacts for possible quarantine measures is one of the major steps in reducing community transmission of the virus33 . It is postulated that rapid and accurate testing protocols can significantly aid in this process34 . We explored FELUDA as a simple alternative to quantitative PCR based detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus since it does not need complex instrumentation (Figure 4A). We designed sgRNAs targeting PAM overlapping symptoms. Additionally, we selected human ACTB as a positive control for human DNA traces that typically accompany the viral DNA extracted from nasal or buccal swabs. Using FELUDA, we obtained clear signatures of SARS-CoV-2 sequence in synthetic DNA using a specific RNP that is distinguishable from non-specific RNP (such as H1N1 or HBB ) (Figure 4B).Importantly FELUDA was also able to distinguish between two SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 sequences that differ by a single nucleotide (SupplementaryFigure 9A)35 . Remarkably, FELUDA based lateral flow assay could distinguish SARS-CoV-2 synthetic DNA on a paper strip only when SARS-CoV-2 specific RNP was used to interrogate the substrate (Figure 4C). Finally, we confirmed the applicability of such lateral flow device as a rapid, cost effective and machine-independent alternative to current testing protocols by successfully detecting the presence of viral signature from low amounts of total RNA obtained from COVID-19 patients within one hour(Figure 4D, Supplementary Figure 9B). We have compiled a standardized protocol for performing this test on clinical samples (Supplementary Note 1). In this report, we present the versatile applications of FELUDA for rapid and accurate detection of nucleic acids at a low cost (Supplementary Figure 9C-D). Leveraging the highly specific binding and subsequent cleavage properties of FnCas9 as distinct enzymatic steps, FELUDA couples sensitivity with broad spectrum of read-out possibilities that can be carried out in the lab or in the field. Detection of low copy numbers of nucleic acids usually involves signal amplification through collateral cleavage of reporter molecules on other CRISPRDx platforms but FELUDA is highly accurate in diagnosing SNVs without them. Its strength lies in unbiased identification of nucleobases and their variants. The affinity based FELUDA assays can be used for designing panels of mutation-scanning sgRNAs on a microchip that can give rise to rapid readouts from patient samples for multiple targets simultaneously (Supplementary Figure 10A). The combination of single mismatch sensitivity and the possibility of tagging different fluorophores to the RNP can allow identifying each of the 4 nucleobases in a target at a given position. This can potentially expand the applications of CRISPR in the domain of affinity based target sequencing",
