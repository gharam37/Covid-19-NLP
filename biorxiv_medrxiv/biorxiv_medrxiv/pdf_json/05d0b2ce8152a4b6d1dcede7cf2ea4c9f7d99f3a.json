To date, more than 2.1 million confirmed cases and 139,500 deaths have been reported worldwide, and there are currently no medical countermeasures available to prevent or treat the disease. As the development of a vaccine could require at least 12-18 months, and the typical timeline from hit finding to drug registration of an antiviral is >10 years, repositioning of known drugs can significantly accelerate the development and deployment of therapies for COVID-19. To identify therapeutics that can be repurposed as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, we profiled a library of known drugs encompassing approximately 12,000 clinical-stage or FDAapproved small molecules. Here, we report the identification of 30 known drugs that inhibit viral replication. Of these, six were characterized for cellular dose-activity relationships, and showed effective concentrations likely to be commensurate with therapeutic doses in patients. These include the PIKfyve kinase inhibitor Apilimod, cysteine protease inhibitors MDL-28170, Z LVG CHN2, VBY-825, and ONO 5334, and the CCR1 antagonist MLN-3897. Since many of these molecules have advanced into the clinic, the known pharmacological and human safety profiles of these compounds will accelerate their preclinical and clinical evaluation for COVID-19 treatment.",

Those include multiple antiviral and antimalarial medicines. Early results of a multicenter trial in China suggested that the antimalarial drug, chloroquine, may limit exacerbation of pneumonia and shorten viral replication and course of disease 15 . A French study that used hydroxychloroquine together with azithromycin reported a significant reduction in viral load in COVID-19 patients when used in combination 16 . However, a sufficiently powered case-control study has not yet been reported, and thus it is unclear if there are therapeutic benefits of chloroquine administration to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, although several concerns are being raised recently, due to the severe cardiac complications potentially resulting from the use of this treatment in COVID-19 patients 17, 18 .",

Here, we describe a high-throughput repositioning screen using the commercial library of 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds LOPAC\u00ae1280 and the ReFRAME (Repurposing, Focused Rescue, and Accelerated Medchem) drug collection, a comprehensive openaccess library of ~12,000 clinical-staged or approved small molecules respectively, to identify existing drugs that harbor antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in a cell-based assay 27, 28 . The ReFRAME library has previously been used to successfully identify the anti-inflammatory auranofin as a potential therapy for tuberculosis 29 , the approved drug clofazimine as a potent antiparasitic compound that is now being tested for efficacy against Cryptosporidium 30 , and has also been used to identify and optimize the FDAapproved antifungal drug itraconazole as a novel efficacious molecule suitable for chronic administration as an anti-fibrotic 31 . Importantly, the ReFRAME library is unique in that it is the only repurposing collection we are aware of where nearly 50% of the library was derived from custom synthesis, as commercially available sources of these clinical molecules were not available 32 . Each of the molecules in this collection has been previously optimized for efficacy, safety, and bioavailability. Therefore, this enables leveraging of the considerable investment in research and development to compress the timeline required for drug discovery and development 33 . For example, repositioning is estimated to reduce the typical 10-17 year development process to 3-12 years 34 , and under emergency use authorization (EUA) for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats during public health emergencies, such as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this may be abbreviated to a <6-month time frame.",

Nonetheless, ACE2 expression has been reported to be induced by type-I interferon 90 . Notably, a majority of the mapped targets of active compounds also harbored expression in relevant respiratory epithelial cells, suggesting these may be physiologically relevant drug targets ( Figure 2B) . Further pathway analyses of these enriched MOAs and targets revealed enrichment in genes involved in nuclear receptor pathways, GPCR ligand binding and signaling, and calcium signaling ( Figure S3) , underscoring the potential critical role of these molecular circuits in cellular control of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle 40 .",

While this may represent the maximal ability of these molecules to suppress viral replication, alternatively, analysis of these molecules utilizing lower MOIs at later timepoint may reveal greater inhibition of infection.

Apilimod has been evaluated in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of active Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 86 , and in additional phase II trials for the oral treatment of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), but did not show efficacy for these indications 85, 87 . In 2019, orphan drug designation was granted to apilimod in the U.S. for the treatment of follicular lymphoma 88 , with phase I clinical trials ongoing. Notably, it has been reported that apilimod efficiently inhibits EBOV, Lassa virus (LASV), and Marburg virus (MARV) in human cell lines, underscoring its potential broad-spectrum antiviral activity 44, 89 . The underlying mechanism for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by apilimod is currently not known. However, since PIKfyve predominately resides in early endosomes and plays an essential role in maintenance of endomembrane homeostasis, apilimod likely blocks viral low pH-dependent entry through inhibition of the lipid kinase activity of PIKfyve.",

Critically, this campaign led to the identification and validation of 30 molecules with antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2, including four FDA-approved compounds, one drug registered in Japan, and 11 molecules that have entered clinical trials. The availability of human safety and pharmacological data of these molecules is expected to enable rapid preclinical and clinical assessment of these compounds. However, expedited regulatory review under EUA guidelines also provides a rationale for the development of earlier stage candidate molecules that can be deployed for use during this current pandemic outbreak.

These data confirmed the antiviral activity of APY0201 against SARS-CoV-2 and enabled us to establish a reliable dynamic range based on the activity of a positive control. Vero E6 cells were seeded in 384-well plates with pre-spotted compounds from the LOPAC\u00ae1280 library at a 5 \u00b5M (final) concentration.
