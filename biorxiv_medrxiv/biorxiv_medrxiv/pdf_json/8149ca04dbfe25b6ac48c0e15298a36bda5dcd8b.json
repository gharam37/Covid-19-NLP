From reported mortality data at the scale of countries (Dong et al., 2020) , one observes a large diversity of temporal dynamics in terms of, for instance, outbreak start, acceleration, epidemic peak and plateau. This diversity can be reproduced, at least partially, by epidemiological models. Either parsimonious (Roques et al., 2020) or more complex Prem et al., 2020) , such models have already been run to describe, infer and forecast the epidemics and estimate epidemiological parameters (e.g., the basic reproduction number R 0 and the death rate). These epidemiological models, based on SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) architectures or their extensions, generally include compartments corresponding to the dead fraction of the population and can hence be used to model and predict the temporal evolution of mortality due to COVID-19, in which we are interested in here. Data-driven approaches have also been proposed, grounded for instance on simple regressions (Zhao et al., 2020) , artificial intelligence-inspired methods (Hu et al., 2020) as well as coupled SIR-neural network approaches (Zeng et al., 2020) . However, in all these cases, the training data correspond to the past dynamics in the country of interest and therefore cannot take into account processes that only arise when a certain number of deaths is reached (e.g., saturation of medical structures or lockdown).",

Typically, media commonly use visualization and data science tools that jointly show curves of mortality for several countries and allow the analyst to guess which trajectory is followed by the country of interest. Thus, heuristically, the countries ahead in time with respect to COVID-19 mortality are used as predictors. One of the advantages of this intuitive approach is that the real dynamics used as predictors intrinsically include the processes and structures underlying the host population, the pathogen evolution, the health system, the control measures, the decision making and even the data collection. One of the drawbacks, for example in the case of COVID-19 at present, is that there may be a low number of countries ahead in time compared to the country of interest and therefore no adequate predictor among the reduced list of predictors.",

To partly avoid the drawback of the potential reduced number of predictors (i.e., countries ahead in time), we propose to model the mortality curve of the country of interest as a mixture of predictors, instead of selecting a single predictor. This mixture-model approach is applied to a set of European countries that have, today, intermediate cumulative numbers of deaths due to COVID-19. Our aim is to assess whether these countries (in the second line with respect to the COVID-19 wave) will follow the trajectories of countries in the front line, with either fast-and-severe epidemics or relatively mild epidemics. The second scenario would be favorable for limiting the mortality due to COVID-19 in Europe.",

We selected the 15 European countries having at least 200 registered deaths by April 14, 2020. The eight countries with the lowest death rate (cumulative number of deaths divided by population size) up to April 14 were chosen as countries whose mortality dynamics have to be forecast. The seven other countries as well as the province of Hubei in China were used to build predictors. Hubei was the first COVID-19 hotspot and its number of registered deaths has clearly reached a plateau, whereas the European countries are still in the increasing stage ( Figure  1 ; see also Suppl. Figure S1 where mortality is scaled by the population size).",

This analysis can be applied on mortality curves observed up to the last observation date available in the data set. It can also be applied by ignoring, voluntarily, a part of the time series, to measure the stability of mortality progression in comparison with available predictors or, in the opposite way, to demonstrate changes in the epidemic regime.

However, some technical choices underlying our method (in particular the smoothing of predictors and the over-dispersed distribution for the daily increments in the number of deaths) make our approach robust to some extent. For instance, Swedish data show a decrease in the number of recorded daily deaths each week-end, but its mortality trajectory is nonetheless relatively adequately forecast. Despite the relative robustness of our approach, its performance would be improved by grounded it on corrected data (e.g., we could re-allocate some deaths recorded on weekdays in Sweden to the preceding weekend, and we could correct French data anterior to April 1st, date before which deaths in nursing homes were not recorded). Correcting data would be particularly crucial for countries that may underestimate COVID-19-induced deaths. It must be however noted that our simple approach applied to raw data can be exploited to detect countries with extreme trajectories (i.e., very mild mortality dynamics), resulting either from bias in data or from particularly efficient ways of mitigating the COVID-19 wave. Identifying the former case can be beneficial to obtain a better assessment of COVID-19 sanitary impact in the country of interest. Identifying the latter case can be beneficial for other countries to improve their control strategies by taking as a model the strategy of the country with extreme trajectory.",

Using Equations (1) and (2), the likelihood satisfies:where f 0it is the probability that a variable following the negative-binomial distribution with mean Z i (t) \u2212 Z i (t \u2212 1) andthe lower the value of \u03b7 i , the larger the dispersion). The likelihood is not directly used to estimate p and \u03b7, but is first weighted and penalized. The weighting allows the estimation to depend more on the last states of the response process Y 0 and the predictors than on their initial states (e.g., to avoid an irrelevant dependence of the estimation on relatively ancient fluctuations that are likely poorly related to the current variations). The penalization is introduced to improve the prediction accuracy and interpretability of mixture probabilities by penalizing predictors that are unlikely at least on some fragments of the observation window. Thus, we propose the following weighted penalized log-likelihood for estimating p:where \u03bb \u2265 0 and 1 is the indicator function. The squared shape of w \u03c4 \u2212t can obviously be substituted, depending on the context, for instance by a linear shape.",

            "text": "For fixed \u03c4 0 , k and \u03bb, the parameter vectors p and \u03b7 can be estimated by maximizingl \u03bb (p, \u03b7, | Y) given by Equation (4) with a constrained BFGS quasi-Newton method (Byrd et al., 1995) . This algorithm easily handles positiveness of parameters. The constraint n i=1 p i = 1 was handled by introducing q i \u2208 [0, \u221e), i = 1, . . . , n, such that q i / n i=1 q i = p i , fixing one of the q i s to the value 1 and maximizingl \u03bb (p, \u03b7, | Y) with respect to the other q i s and \u03b7. Let us now describe how \u03c4 0 , k and \u03bb are specified. The first observation time \u03c4 0 and the maximal bandwidth k are considered as given for the analysis of COVID-19 data: we use \u03c4 0 = \u03c4 \u2212 30 days allowing our analysis to handle the inertia of the epidemics at country level and k = 3 days resulting in rather smooth predictors. The penalization parameter \u03bb, whose value cannot be intuitively fixed unlike \u03c4 0 and k, is calibrated by minimizing the mean squared error between (Y 0 (\u03c4 \u2212 2), Y 0 (\u03c4 \u2212 1), Y 0 (\u03c4 )) and its mixture-based prediction obtained by using only data up to time \u03c4 \u2212 3. The mixture-based prediction of Y 0 (t) for t beyond the last observation date \u03c4 is simply its expectation satisfying:Thus, \u03bb is fixed at the value\u03bb satisfying:where\u00ca 1:(\u03c4 \u22123),\u03bb (Y 0 (t )) is derived from Equation (5), in which \u03c4 is replaced by \u03c4 \u2212 3 and p i are replaced by their estimate\u015d p i (\u03bb) maximizingl \u03bb (p, \u03b7 | Y 1:(\u03c4 \u22123) ), itself derived from Equation 4 where Y 1:(\u03c4 \u22123) gathers data up to time \u03c4 \u2212 3 and replaces Y. Then, estimatesp and\u03b7 of p and \u03b7 are estimated by maximizingl\u03bb(p, \u03b7 | Y) and the dynamics of Y 0 beyond \u03c4 is forecast by simulating Model (1) where one plugs inp and\u03b7 and by drawing, for instance, 95%-confidence envelopes. The forecast horizon of Y 0 depends on how much each predicting countries is ahead in time. E.g., for a predicting country that is m days ahead in time, the forecast horizon is m days. Thus, when time goes on beyond \u03c4 , there are less and less available predictors. In our analyses, we stop the forecast at the date when available predictors correspond to a sum of probabilitiesp i less than 0.5. An alternative of the forecast can be drawn by assuming that, for each simulation, the trajectory of the epidemic follows a single predictor sampled with respect to the mixture probabilities. This approach generally leads to wider 95%-confidence envelopes.",
