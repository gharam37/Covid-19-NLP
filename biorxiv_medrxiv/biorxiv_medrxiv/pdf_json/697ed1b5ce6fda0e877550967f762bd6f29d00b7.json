On the image scans, the pulmonary tissues were divided into two single lungs (left and right lung) and three zones (upper, middle, and lower zones of lung in the bilateral lungs). These areas of the lung were defined as the \"upper zones\" above the level of the carina; the \"middle zones\" between the level of the carina and the level of the inferior pulmonary veins; and the \"lower zones\" below the level of the inferior pulmonary veins. The CT score was determined by visually estimating the extent of disease in each zone. The severity scores were evaluated according to the percentage of lung parenchyma in each zone that showed evidence of each recorded abnormality: (1) no injury; (2) 1 point, involvement of less than 25% of the image; (3) 2 ponits, 25% to 50%; (4) 3 points, 50% to 75%; (5) 4 ponits, more than 75%.

We showed that older patients were more susceptible to lymphocyte reduction. Moreover, lymphocyte reduction on admission was positively associated with multiple organ injuries. In addition, lymphocyte reduction on admission elevated the severity and death risk of COVID-19 patients. Our results suggest that lymphocytes may be a direct target of SARS-COV-2. We provide evidence that lymphocyte reduction at early stage may be a potential negative prognostic indicator for COVID-19 patients. Therefore, surveillance of lymphocyte count is helpful for the early screening, diagnosis and treatment of critical ill COVID-19 patients.",

Similarly, the lymphocyte percentage in patients over 70 years old were lower than those under 60 years old and between 60 to 69 years old (12.1% vs 22.1% with 15.8%, P\uff1d0.001).
