            "text": "Effective public health response to viral outbreaks such as SARS-CoV-2 is often informed by real-time 9 PCR screening of large populations. Pooling samples can increase screening capacity. However, when 10 a traditional pool is tested positive, all samples in the pool need individual retesting, which becomes 11 ineffective at a higher proportion of positive samples. Here, we report a new pooling protocol that 12 mitigates this problem by replicating samples across multiple pools. The resulting pool set allows the 13 sample status to be resolved more often than with traditional pooling. At 2% prevalence and 20 samples 14 per pool, our protocol increases screening capacity by factors of 5 and 2 compared to individual testing 15 and traditional pooling, respectively.

It is, therefore, desirable to maximize the number of samples that can be tested per reaction. 23 Various approaches have been proposed to do so in the context of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. 2,3 One 24 problem with the traditional pooling approach, where several samples are collected and tested collectively, 25 is that the number of positive pools that require individual retesting increases rapidly with the number 26 of positive samples in the overall population, henceforth called \"prevalence\". A high prevalence renders 27 traditional pooling ineffective. To mitigate this, we propose to test samples in replicates and distribute 28 them across multiple pools. The resulting \"pool address\" can then be used to resolve samples in one pool, 29 given the information from other pools that contain a replicate. While some previous studies have taken a 30 similar approach implicitly, 2 it has neither been investigated systematically for more replicates than two, 31 nor is there any software that would generate and resolve the corresponding pooling layout for laboratory 32 use. 33 We therefore introduce \"clonepool\", a pooling framework to maximize the effective number of samples 34 per PCR reaction. \"Effective\" refers to the fact that samples in positive pools, whose status cannot be We tested the proposed clonepool algorithm using simulated data. We assumed no pipetting errors, 50 which can be achieved, e.g., through the use of a pipetting robot. We also assume that 94 pools are 51 available, which corresponds to a 96-well plate with two wells reserved for a positive and a negative 52 control. Furthermore, we assume that there are no false positive or false negative PCR reactions.",

After the pools have been 40 tested, the algorithm attempts to resolve the samples' status in two phases: In a first phase, all samples 41 that have at least one replicate in a negative pool are marked negative.
