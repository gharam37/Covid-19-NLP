However, in resource-constrained countries such as the Philippines, test kits have limited availability. As of 12 April 2020, there are 11 testing centers in the country that have been accredited by the Department of Health (DOH) to conduct testing. In this paper, we determine the optimal percentage allocation of COVID-19 test kits among accredited testing centers in the Philippines that gives an equitable chance to all infected individuals to be tested. Heterogeneity in testing accessibility, population density of municipalities, and the capacity of testing facilities are included in the model. Our results showed that the range of optimal allocation per testing center are: Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (4.Philippines Medical Center (\u2248 0.01%). If there will be changes in the number of testing centers, our model can still be used to modify the test kit allocation. Our results can serve as a guide to the authorities in distributing the COVID-19 test kits. These can also be used to determine the capacity of testing centers and the effects of increasing its number. The model can also be used for proposing additional number and location of new testing centers.",

Only those who are considered \"patients under investigation\" (PUI) are qualified to be tested. These are persons with severe symptoms such as fever and/or respiratory syndrome, history of travel in the past 14 days to countries with local transmission and history of exposure with a confirmed case [8] .",

These centers have conducted a total of 38,640 tests (as of 11 April 2020) [12, 9] . With these, and several other laboratories awaiting accreditation, the Philippine government plans to start a massive testing program for COVID-19 on 14 April 2020 to fully assess the public health situation. Conducting mass testing will not only help in tracing the asymptomatic carriers who need isolation, it will also protect the healthcare workers who are exposed to this contagious disease [10] . Even though DOH will increase its capacity for testing, resources such as testing kits are still insufficient to efficiently test the whole susceptible population in the Philippines [5, 13] . Thus, it is necessary to find an optimal strategy of distributing the available test kits among the accredited testing centers such that each individual estimated to be infected has an equitable chance of being tested.",

We apply the model to the population density-adjusted number of COVID-19 infected individuals projection in the Philippines.

We use these coordinates in the computations except for two: Datu Hoffer Ampatuan and Shariff Sardona Mustapha, Maguindanao. Geocode app cannot locate Shariff Sardona Mustapha, and it returned incorrect coordinates for Datu Hoffer Ampatuan. We use the coordinates of one barangay from each municipality instead. In addition, we compute for various dispersal length scale parameters k shown in (3) We utilize the 11 accredited testing centers to determine the optimal distribution of testing kits. Shown in Table 1 is the proportion of testing kits to be distributed among the 11 testing centers using different values for k. We can observe that UP-NIH will receive the biggest proportion, ranging from 16.25% to 44.80%, while Southern Philippines Medical Center will receive the smallest proportion which is 0.01%. From the results, we notice that San Lazaro Hospital, UP-NIH and Lung Center of the Philippines got the majority of the proportion, across all scenarios. If mass testing will push through, these three hospitals will be overworked and will not be able to deliver timely results on the tests. To address this, we propose to add more testing centers. We identify 10 communities with the highest number of infected individuals and no existing accredited testing center. We will treat these 10 communities as the location of the suggested additional testing centers. We then compute for the optimal distribution of testing kits to the 21 testing centers. The proportion of test kits allocated to each of UP-NIH, San Lazaro Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines and Makati City is greater than 10%. We can say that this distribution poses concerns similar to that of only having 11 testing centers. To reduce the proportion of test kits allocated to each of these testing centers, we consider all communities with more than 5,000 infected individuals. We then identify 19 communities as locations of new testing centers in addition to the original 11 and compute for the optimal distribution of testing kits to the 30 testing centers.",

For instance, let us assume that 300,000 testing kits will be distributed. From the optimal distribution, UP-NIH will receive an average of almost 89,000 testing kits, across the different values we considered for the dispersal length. This implies that it needs more than 1,000 days to complete the testing for patients in UP-NIH which translates to more than two years to complete the testing. If we consider the proposed 30 testing centers, UP-NIH will receive almost 19,000 testing kits, and this translates to 245 days to complete the testing. This is a drastic decrease to the number of days needed to complete all testing from 11 testing centers to 30 testing centers. With these realizations, we observed that the greater the number of testing centers operating, the faster the completion of all testing of patients, and the more patients tested per day. We also recommend that these additional testing centers should be located in strategic places, that is, in the location with high density of infected individuals as shown in Figure 3 .",

The model exhausts all available test kits but the complexity of test kit resource dynamics determines the limitation of our study. Further studies should also incorporate individuals needing multiple tests, effectiveness of testing kits, and transport time for testing kit delivery. In conclusion, a larger amount of test kits (not limited to initial testing, and to symptomatic patients) and more testing centers are ideal to increase the number of individuals tested to aid in \"flattening\" the epidemic curve.",
