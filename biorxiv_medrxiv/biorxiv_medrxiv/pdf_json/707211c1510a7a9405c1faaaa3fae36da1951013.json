We found that countries with the highest testing rates per population have the lowest death rates and give us an early indication of an eventual COVID-19 mortality rate. It is only by continued testing on a large scale that will enable us to know if the increasing number of patients who are seriously unwell in hospitals across the world are the tip of the iceberg or not. Accordingly, obtaining this information through a rapid increase in testing globally is the only way which will enable us to exit the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce economic and social instability.",

            "text": "The Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) outbreak has caused havoc across the world after it was first reported in Wuhan, China 1,2 . Subsequently, research on COVID-19 has exploded to understand the new disease and its impact on mankind [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, the number of baseless articles resulting in fake news articles has also gone up exponentially [17] [18] [19] . A number of models have been adapted by policymakers to predict the course of COVID-19 across the world 4, 6, 13, 20 . The reason for such models is to ensure that healthcare systems can plan services to help them cope with the demands of this new disease which is resulting in serious cases leading to hospitalisation 3, 8 . Core elements of the prediction models have been the number of cases and deaths reported and these studies extrapolated the numbers forward to the population over time 4, 6, 13, 20 . Given the pandemic course of COVID-19, it has become common practice to compare its spread in different countries using case fatality rates 3, 4, 7, 13 . However, such methods only tell us part of the story. Vast differences amongst countries in their testing policies for varied reasons including availability of testing equipment, infrastructure, resources and local governing policies affect case fatality rates. In addition, comparing case fatality rates between countries which are at different stages of the epidemic in their region would be erroneous as rates at the beginning and end would be lower compared to rates at the peak when healthcare services are stretched to their limits. Therefore, the search for a common yardstick or denominator is necessary to compare different countries so that the data can be extrapolated for global comparison. Over the past four weeks, as COVID-19 spread further around the world, testing rates have picked up in most countries. We propose that analysis of the number of diagnostic tests performed in proportion to the number of cases and subsequently deaths in the underlying populations of different countries is the best way to predict what might happen next. We analysed this from the ACALM Big Data research unit.",

Therefore, we further undertook a consistent adjustment according to countries which performed the most tests; in favour of larger countries with bigger populations we chose an arbitrary cut off of 100,000 tests per country. 15 countries had undertaken more than 100,000 tests and as all these countries showed differences in their cases/test and deaths/test we took the 15 country group as a whole to obtain an adjustment factor according to the cases/test and deaths/test. Using this we derived a case per test rate of 13.53% and a death per test rate of 0.77% for the 15 country group. Based on the above numbers, we extrapolated figures at the population level for all 50 countries to calculate the predicated number of cases and deaths.",

If only those with symptoms are tested then individuals are more likely to test positive for COVID-19 leading to a low test per positive number. If these countries test the sickest of patients as you would expect in countries with the largest populations and limited testing kits to do, then high testing rates per positive case is even more remarkable as it may suggest lower virus rates compared to other countries but this cannot be concluded from this study. Furthermore, the reliability of local testing kits is an important factor as there are a number of reports of COVID-19 patients testing negative numerous times before a positive test 11 . South Korea can be considered as an exception to this because following an explosion of cases initially, they embarked on an extensive testing policy along with isolation policies combined with the utility of mobile tech and applications to inform the public about real time locations of positive cases. As such, it is widely accepted that South Korea are further along the pandemic curve and the rates of new cases and deaths have significantly reduced [22] [23] [24] .",

Globally lockdowns have been instated to reduce the spread of infection, allow the healthcare systems to cope with the condition and \"flatten the curve\" of the pandemic. These were not enforced all at once and the projections in table 3 are based on the data available on 4/4/2020 and a snapshot depending on the actions, policies of individual countries.

There are a number of factors for low testing rates such as local policies, lack of resources and equipment and it is impossible to discuss them all; we point out that testing rates are extremely important in projecting the outcomes of the pandemic particularly in countries with large populations.

For example in spite of the case per test and deaths per test rate being low in India, as the population of the country is large, the projections are still over 10 millions deaths as per table 4 (adjustment according to countries which have performed more than 100,000 tests) and 500,000 deaths as per table 5 (South Korea adjustment).",

Clearly from the example of South Korea we can contain COVID-19 and in spite of differences of the specific policies of lockdown between countries, social distancing and limiting spread are the broad themes to take forward. The analyses in this study highlight the importance of testing as the relevant denominator for which all the COVID-19 data should be related to. The testing policy is advocated strongly by the WHO in their COVID-19 statements 1 . The suggested early indication of a low mortality rate from our analyses, coupled with the fact that COVID-19 is a new disease affecting the globe in a short time, it is highly plausible that the serious cases and deaths we are seeing in the some countries may be the tip of the iceberg of a disease that has spread widely. If we look at influenza data there are millions of cases and up to half a million deaths worldwide every year due to flu and these tend to be seasonal in spite of vaccination programmes and herd immunity to some extent [27] [28] [29] [30] . In the case of COVID-19 we might be experiencing the full whammy of a disease without .

This data suggests that both countries are undertaking a large number of tests to detect one positive case. In these countries the overall percentage of population tested is low. Bias in these figures could be the reliability of the reported number of tests performed. For example, the figures for India as released by the Indian Council of Medical Research 25 in terms of numbers tested are not as",
