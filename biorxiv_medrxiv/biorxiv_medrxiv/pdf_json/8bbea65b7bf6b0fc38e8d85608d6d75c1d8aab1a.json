In other words, drawing a more realistic picture about the spread and fatality rate of COVID-19 requires consideration of a combination of such parameters, as the rate of fatality is not all about the actions that are taken, but also due to many other factors developed in each region over many years due to a variety of environmental, health, culture, economic and political reasons that we might have little or no control on in the limited time that the world has to deal with COVID-19.",

For example, when similar government interventions are implemented, why different regions experience different fatality rates? How and which environmental, cultural, economic, and health variables define the vulnerability of a country to COVID-19? In this study, we present a different view on the problem by classifying them into three groups that we explain shortly. To do so, we have studied the correlations between twelve environmental, economic and health variables, and have carried out a statistical analysis of the fatality rate of COVID-19 in many countries, as a first step for highlighting how countryspecific variables may influence the fatality rate. Such a study should contribute toward developing realistic models for describing the fatality rate of the Coronavirus, other than simply considering parameters whose influence may be minor.",

Applying similar socialdistancing measures in different regions of the world may have different effectiveness because of the effects of other variables that influence the vulnerability of a specific region or country to COVID-19. Identifying the economic, environmental, health and social variables affecting the vulnerability of people in different regions to this devastating virus is important to devising appropriate and thoughtful response for addressing the pandemic.",

To identify the most accurate equation, we used a stepwise algorithm, whereby systematic adding and removing the variables from Eq. (1) in the presence of all the variables were carried out. The method keeps/removes the variables based on their importance concerning the target variable, i.e., ND. Thus, it starts with a large initial model, i.e., one with a large number of variables, and then compares the explanatory power of incrementally larger and smaller models. More specifically, a forward--backward model is used to determine the final equation. It uses p-value and t-statistic to verify how a model behaves with and without a variable. As such, a variable is assigned a zero coefficient if it is not already in the model. If the remaining variables have p-values less than a threshold, the variable with the smallest p-value is added to the model. Otherwise, if the existing variables in the model have p-values larger than the threshold, the variable with the largest p-value is removed. Finally, the model is terminated if no improvements are observed.",

Mathematical models 7 are used to quantify how the implementation of such interventions can possibly slow the spread of COVID-19 or \"flatten the curve\". Valuable insights are obtained by such modelling, which can form an important part of policymaking for helping the government actions to alter the course of the outbreak.",
