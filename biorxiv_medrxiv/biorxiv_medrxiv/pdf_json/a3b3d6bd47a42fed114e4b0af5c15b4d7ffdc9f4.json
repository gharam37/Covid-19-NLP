As the disease continues to grow, many studies have characterized disease transmission dynamics and estimated certain important epidemiological properties, including the basic reproductive number R0 and the number of actual infections [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . The estimation of transmissibility R0 is important because the level of control measures required to contain the outbreak can thus be obtained 6 . Although a wide range of the R0 was produced after the disease dynamics occurred in Wuhan, most of the studies focused on early transmission dynamics 1, 4, 6, 8 . Characterizing the transmissibility after initial periods when the control measures have been put in place and the COVID-19 detection capability has been improved is important to understand the effect of those measures 4 . However, none of the studies has considered the changes in both prevention measures and detection capability.",

After the introduction of new commercial kits to provide a higher diagnosis rate 17 and the improvements of diagnostic criteria 18 (Figure 1 ), the capacity of diagnosis has been gradually increased.

Studies have shown the presence of the incubation infections of COVID-19 19 . Specifically, a recent study reported a 20-year-old woman from Wuhan passed it to five of her family members but never got physically sick herself 20 . Another study in Germany reported that a case with mild symptoms infected two colleagues when they worked together 21 . Given the transmission by asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic persons, it indicates that time from exposure to infection may be shorter than the incubation period.

Furthermore, our results showed both transportation restriction and quarantine measures were able to limit virus transmission. Transportation restrictions, including halting all forms of public transportation, trains, and air travel, sharply reduced social contacts and virus transmission rates. Concurrent with the implementation of transportation measures, personal awareness of the virus and protective behavior (e.g., wearing facemasks, washing hands frequently, social distancing) also increased. Although our study did not exclude the effects caused by changes in public response coming along with the transportation measures, we found R e dropped by 87% after the introduction of transportation restriction. These findings are in agreement with the results of Kucharski et al. 7 and Ruiyun et al. 16 . Besides, quarantine of the symptomatic infections was also essential in curbing the epidemic 25 . Under the actual condition in Wuhan (with quarantine), the estimated time from symptom to quarantine was around 5.65 days at the initial stage, possibly due to a lack of sufficient resources during this period.",
