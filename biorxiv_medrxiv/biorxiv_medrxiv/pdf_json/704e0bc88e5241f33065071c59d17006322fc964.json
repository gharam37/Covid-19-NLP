Susceptible individuals in each age group were assumed at risk of acquiring the infection at a hazard rate that varies based on the age-specific susceptibility to the infection (Supplementary Figure S1 ), the infectious contact rate per day, and the transmission mixing matrix between the different age groups (Supplementary Section 1). Following a latency period of 3.69 days [15] [16] [17] [18] , infected individuals develop mild, severe, or critical infection, as informed by the observed age-specific distribution of cases across these infection stages in China [8] [9] [10] . The duration of infectiousness was assumed to last for 3.48 days [8, 15, 17, 18] after which individuals with mild infection recover, while those with severe and critical infection develop, respectively, severe and critical disease over a period of 28 days [8] prior to recovery.",

Countries with sizable adult and/or elderly populations and smaller children populations may experience large and rapid epidemics in absence of interventions, necessitating disruptive social distancing measures to contain the epidemic. Meanwhile, countries with predominantly younger age cohorts may experience smaller and slower epidemics and may require less disruptive social distancing measures to contain the epidemic. These predictions, however, should not lead to complacency, and should not affect national response in strengthening preparedness plans and in implementing prevention interventions. Once established, and even if smaller in scale due to their predominantly younger population, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic would still cause a heavy toll on developing countries with resource-poor healthcare infrastructure.",

For these countries, the upper limit of the uncertainty interval was set at 700 days, that is the end day of the simulation. Uncertainty runs in which R0 was less than 1 led to no epidemic emergence, and thus were excluded from further analysis. Reported ranges for the epidemic indicators did not include these runs, except for the range of R0. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",
