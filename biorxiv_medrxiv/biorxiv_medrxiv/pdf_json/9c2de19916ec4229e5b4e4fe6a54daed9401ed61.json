It is majorly spread through persistence on inanimate surfaces and is similar to outbreaks of SARS and MERS, originating through bats [3, 4] . Studies on the nature of the virus have suggested different incubation periods of the virus, and reports have suggested a median incubation period of 5-6 days and a very high symptom probability period of 14 days [5] . The virus is transmitted through carriers even before their symptoms show [6] . The article suggests the simulation on Online Social Networks that resemble human interactions, using time-variant infection rates that accommodate the dormancy and incubation period of the novel virus, to simulate the spread of the virus among people. This research aims to provide a mathematical model for the spread and control of the virus, considering the control measures of quarantine and social distancing. The results shall highlight the importance of early-detection, selfquarantine and hygiene practices.",

Members of the site can decide whether to trust each other, thus simulating the interactions between people in a total population of 75879 with about 508837 connections in these people representing potential transfer among these people [7] . The traditional model used to study diseases is usually the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-model, which is a popular model to simulate outbreaks, including the 2019-nCoV [8] . This model may be extended to include a quarantine state to give the Susceptible-Infected-Quarantine-Recovered model [9] . This paper uses a modified version of this model, considering that the infection and quarantine (on symptom) rate varies based on the number of days, the host is carrying the virus [10] . Based on the findings regarding the spread of the virus, 14 different infection and quarantine rates are hyper-parameters that are based on the hygiene and social-distancing practices assumed for these hosts.
