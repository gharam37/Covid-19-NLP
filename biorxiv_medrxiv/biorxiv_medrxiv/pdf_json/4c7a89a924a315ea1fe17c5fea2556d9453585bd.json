We set out to examine genetic differences in the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) gene, as its receptor serves as a cellular entry for SARS-CoV-2. By comparing 56,885 Non-Finnish European and 9,197 East Asians (including 1,909 Koreans) four missense mutations were noted in the hACE2 gene. Molecular dynamic demonstrated that two of these variants (K26R and I468V) may affect binding characteristics between S protein of the virus and hACE2 receptor. We also examined hACE2 gene expression in eight global populations from the HapMap3 and noted marginal differences in expression for some populations as compared to the Chinese population. However, for both of our studies, the magnitude of the difference was small and the significance is not clear in the absence of further in vitro and functional studies.",

The initial wild type structure of the human ACE2 (hACE2) was selected from the X-ray crystal complex structure between hACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein from Protein Data Bank15 (PDB ID: 6LZG). The initial structures of mutants were constructed using FoldX (http://foldxsuite.crg.eu/command/PositionScan). The structural minimizations and molecular dynamics simulation was performed using the GROMACS 2018.416-18 software package. OPLS-AA force field was adopted for the protein complex and the SPCE water model for solvate the system. The periodic boundary conditions (PBC) in a cubic box was applied, and the distance to the edge of the box was set as 1.0 nm. After the protein complex system was solvated, the appropriate numbers of sodium and chloride ions were added to neutralize the system. Equilibration simulations were done under the NVT ensemble for 2 ns and then the NPT ensemble for 1 ns after an extensive energy minimization by using the steepest descent algorithm. The simulation time step was 2 fs.",
