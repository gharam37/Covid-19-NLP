Therefore, this type of mutations could be defined as fixed neuro-regulatory human-specific single nucleotide changes (hsSNCs). However, only a small fraction of identified DA chromatin peaks (600 of 17,935 DA peaks; 3.3%) manifest associations with differential expression in human versus chimpanzee cerebral organoids model of brain development, consistent with the hypothesis that regulatory effects on gene expression of these DA chromatin regions are not restricted to the early stages of brain development. Annotation of SNCs derived and fixed in modern humans that overlap DA chromatin regions during brain development revealed that essentially all candidate regulatory human-specific SNCs are shared with the archaic humans (35,010 SNCs; 99.8%) and only 64 SNCs are unique to modern humans (Kanton et al., 2019) . This remarkable conservation on the human lineage of human-specific SNCs associated with human brain development sows the seed of interest for in-depth exploration of coding genes expression of which may be affected by genetic regulatory loci harboring human-specific SNCs.",

It has been concluded that hsSNCs-linked genes appear contributing to development and functions of the adult human brain and other components of the central nervous system; they were defined as genetic markers of many tissues across human body and were implicated in the extensive range of human physiological and pathological conditions, thus supporting the hypothesis that phenotype-altering effects of neuro-regulatory hsSNCs are not restricted to the early-stages of human brain development. Differential GSEA implemented on hsSNC-linked loci and associated genes identify 7,990 genes linked to evolutionary distinct classes of human-specific regulatory sequences (HSRS). Notably, expression of a majority of this common set of genes (5,389 genes; 67%) is regulated by stem cell-associated retroviral sequences (SCARS). Collectively, observations reported in this contribution indicate that structurally, functionally and evolutionary diverse classes of HSRS, neuro-regulatory hsSNCs, and associated elite set of 7,990 genes affect wide spectra of traits defining both physiology and pathology of Modern Humans by asserting human-specific regulatory impacts on thousands essential mammalian phenotypes.

The fraction of hsSNCs-linked genes differentially expressed in human versus chimpanzee brains is significantly higher among human brain regions' marker genes compared to non-markers ( Figure 2B ; p = 1,535E-42; 2-tail Fisher's exact test). These observations support the hypothesis that genetic loci harboring human-specific SNCs may exert regulatory effects on structural and functional features of the adult human brain, thus, likely affecting the development and functions of the central nervous system in Modern Humans. Consistent with this idea, the examination of the enrichment patterns of human-specific SNCs-associated genes in the ARCHS4 Human Tissues' gene expression database revealed that top 10 most significantly enriched records overlapping a majority of region-specific marker genes constitute various anatomically-distinct regions of the central nervous system (Supplemental Figure 1 ; Supplemental Table Set S2 ). However, results of gene set enrichment analyses convincingly demonstrate that inferred regulatory effects of genetic loci harboring humanspecific SNCs are not restricted only to the various regions of the central nervous system, they appear to affect gene expression profiles of many different cell types and tissues in the human body (Table 1; Supplemental   Table Set S2) .",

It was interest to determine whether genes previously linked to other classes of HSRS, which were identified without considerations of human-specific neuro-regulatory SNCs, overlap with genes associated in this contribution with genomic regulatory loci harboring human-specific SNCs. To this end, genes associated with different classes of HSRS were identified using the GREAT algorithm, subjected to the GSEA, and compared with the set of 8,405 genes linked with neuro-regulatory hsSNCs. Notably, all classes of HSRS appear to share common sub-sets of putative genetic regulatory targets with neuro-regulatory hsSNCs (Table 3; To determine whether the patterns of significant phenotypic associations observed for genes linked with HSRS are specific and not related to the size effects of relatively large gene sets subjected to the GSEA, 42,847 human genes not linked by the GREAT algorithm with HSRS were randomly split into 21 control gene sets of various sizes ranging from 2,847 to 6,847 genes and subjected to the GSEA (Supplemental Notes 1 & 2). Importantly, no significant phenotypic associations were observed for 21 control gene sets, consistent with the conclusion that significant phenotypic associations documented for genes linked with HSRS and neuroregulatory hsSNCs are not likely due to non-specific size effects captured by the GSEA.

Importantly, human-specific GRNs selected for these analyses were defined employing vastly different experimental, analytical, and computational approaches that were applied within the broad range of experimental settings (Glinsky, 2019) . Specifically, the interrogated human-specific GRNs include the following data sets: i) Great Apes' whole-genome sequencing-guided human-specific insertions and deletions (Kronenberg et al., 2018) ; ii) genome-wide analysis of retrotransposon's transcriptome in postmortem samples of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ; iii) shRNA-mediated silencing of LTR7/HERVH retrovirus-derived long non-coding RNAs in hESC (Wang et al., 2014) ; iv) single-cell expression profiling analyses of human preimplantation embryos ; v) network of genes associated with regulatory transposable elements (TE) operating in na\u00efve and primed hESC (Theunissen et al., 2016; Pontis et al., 2019) ; vi) pluripotency-related network of genes manifesting concordant expression changes in human fetal brain and adult neocortex ; vii) network of genes governing human neurogenesis in vivo (Nowakowski et al., 2017) ; viii) network of genes differentially expressed during human corticogenesis in vitro (van de Leemput et al., 2014) . Thus, selected for these analyses human-specific GRNs appear to function in a developmentally and physiologically diverse spectrum of human cells that are biologically and anatomically highly relevant to manifestations of human-specific phenotypes ranging from preimplantation embryos to adult dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Table 4 ; Supplemental Table Set S3) .",

            "text": "Gene set enrichment analyses were carried-out using the Enrichr bioinformatics platform, which enables the interrogation of nearly 200,000 gene sets from more than 100 gene set libraries. The Enrichr API (January 2018 through January 2020 releases) (Chen et al., 2013; Kuleshov et al., 2016) was used to test genes linked to HSRS of interest for significant enrichment in numerous functional categories. In all tables and plots (unless stated otherwise), in addition to the nominal p values and adjusted p values, the \"combined score\" calculated by Enrichr is reported, which is a product of the significance estimate and the magnitude of enrichment (combined score c = log(p) * z, where p is the Fisher's exact test p-value and z is the z-score deviation from the expected rank). When technically feasible, larger sets of genes comprising several thousand entries were analyzed. Regulatory connectivity maps between HSRS and coding genes and additional functional enrichment analyses were performed with the GREAT algorithm (McLean et al., 2010; 2011) at default settings. The reproducibility of the results was validated by implementing two releases of the GREAT algorithm: GREAT version 3.0.0 (2/15/2015 to 08/18/2019) and GREAT version 4.0.4 (08/19/2019). Genomewide Proximity Placement Analysis (GPPA) of distinct genomic features co-localizing with HSRS was carried out as described previously and originally implemented for human-specific transcription factor binding sites (Glinsky, 2015 (Glinsky, -2019 .",

Strikingly, among the records of mammalian phenotypes identified by the gene set enrichment analyses of neuro-regulatory hsSNCs-linked genes, there are 2,273 genes mutations of which result in phenotypes of premature death, embryonic lethality, as well as prenatal, perinatal, neonatal, and postnatal lethality of both complete and incomplete penetrance. A significant fraction of these 2,273 genes, which collectively could be defined based on patterns of phenotypes caused by their mutations as an offspring survival genomic dominion, was implicated in the autosomal dominant (389 genes) and recessive (426 genes) inheritance in Modern Humans.
