Through numerical experiments, we observe the effects of quarantine, social distancing, and COVID-19 testing on the dynamics of the outbreak. Using knowledge gleaned from the Hubei outbreak, we apply our model to analyze the dynamics of outbreak in Turkey.

This outbreak quickly spread to all states of China and across the globe, being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. The authorities imposed a strict lock-down on the city of Wuhan and other cities of the Hubei province on 23 January 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020b) . In the face of over sixty-seven thousand cases and over three thousand deaths, the authorities continued strict enforcement of these measures (Chinese physicians, 2020; Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by Johns Hopkins CSSE, 2020). Finally, on 23 March 2020, Hubei reached a significant milestone as the province's health commission reported no new cases for seven consecutive days (World Health Organization, 2020b; The New York Times, 2020) . Shortly thereafter, after over two months of severe restrictions on the movements of the Hubei population, the \"2020 Hubei Lockdowns\" were relaxed as the Hubei outbreak began to wane, inspiring hope that the global pandemic might be able to be controlled.",

Indeed, it is of the utmost importance to use these tools to investigate the effectiveness of public health strategies, such as the number of COVID-19 tests carried out to detect the infected, the level of quarantine/social distancing, and its efficiency in the transmission of studies investigate dynamics of this pandemic from a global perspective (see, e.g., (Imai, Dorigatti, Cori, Riley, & Ferguson, 2020; Read, Bridgen, Cummings, Ho, & Jewell, 2020; Riou & Althaus, 2020; Shen, Peng, Xiao, & Zhang, 2020; Zhao et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020) ).

These parameters were estimated with existing data as of (Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by Johns Hopkins CSSE, 2020). In order to determine the set of parameters that are statistically significant regarding the number of cumulative infected cases, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of the model. We utilized a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and the Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCC) method (Marino, Hogue, Ray, & Kirschner, 2008) . We use a range given in Table 2 to sample parameters from a uniform distribution, then use these samples as input variables when we run the system (1) with initial conditions S(0) = 1000, S q (0) = 0, E(0) = 10, I(0) = 3, I q (0) = 0, R(0) = 0 for 90 days.

Figure 6 shows the results of these experiments, how the number of cumulative cases changes for different values of s q , i q , r, and \u03b2. It is also important to analyze how R 0 value varies with \u03b2 and i q . Thus, we vary \u03b2 in the range [1, 10] and i q in the range [0.1, 4] while keeping all other parameters the same in Table 1 . Figure 7 shows the boxplot of \u03b2 and i q . We observe i q affects R 0 in a wider range compare to \u03b2. Thus, the range of R 0 will change roughly between 3 and 8. In addition, the value of R 0 drops below 1 when i q is above 5.1.",

We fit the model (1) with Turkish data from March 10, 2020 to April 10, 2020, and get about 5.9% relative error in the fit by using the equation (3). We estimate the four parameters i q , s q , \u03b2, and r, which are not only the most significant parameters in the dynamics of outbreak, but also are specific to each country since they are related to the number of COVID-19 tests administered i q , the number of individuals in quarantine s q , the contact rate of individuals \u03b2, and the efficiency of quarantine r in each country. Therefore, by using the initial conditions: S(0) = 83, 000, 000, S q (0) = 0, I q (0) = 1, and R(0) = 0, we estimate these four parameters together with the initial number of exposed and infected individuals. We do not estimate the rest of the parameters, employing the parameters in Table 1 . Therefore, our results in this section will depend on observed dynamics of the outbreak in Hubei as well as the available Turkish data (((Ministry of Health (Turkey), 2020)). Note that the quarantine rate and the rate of reported cases (which, we stress, is related to number of COVID-19 tests) can be increased, and the increase still may have significant effect toward the reduction of the number of cases (See Figure 6 , sensitivity analysis), but increasing the reduction rate r does not make very significant changes by way of the number of cases in Turkey since it is very close to its maximum level (See Figure 6 , sensitivity analysis part). Thus, we will vary only the quarantine rate s q and the rate of reported cases i q in forecasting the peak of the outbreak and the number of cases/deaths in Turkey.",

This implies that in terms of numbers of COVID-19 tests conducted per day, Turkey is now doing a better job than Hubei, China at a comparable time in Hubei's outbreak. The efficiency of quarantine also seems to be very good in Turkey, given the approximately 85% reduction in the contact rate of COVID-19 obtained by our parameter estimation. On the other hand, the quarantine rate is about 0.088, which is small when compared with the quarantine rate in Hubei (the rate was 0.096 in Hubei). In Hubei, the population transitioned to quarantine class very quickly (almost in two weeks), but in Turkey the movement to quarantine has been very slow in comparison (see Figure 8 ), suggesting why the contact rate is higher in Turkey when we compare to the contact rate in Hubei (See Table 1 and 3 for these rates). It is still possible to increase the quarantine rate (the rate, per day, of transition to quarantine class) and the number of COVID-19 tests given each day in Turkey to make a reduction in the number of cases and deaths (See Figures 9 and  10 ). In Figures 9 and 10 , the red curves are obtained using base parameters from Table 1 and 3, and the other curves obtained by varying the quarantine rate s q and the rate of reported cases i q . When we use the base parameter values which are obtained from our fitting, Turkey then will have about 203,700 cases and 8,269 deaths. If Turkey can increase the number of individuals in quarantine and the number of daily COVID-19 tests, then, depending on the magnitude of the increases, the number of cases and deaths can decrease significantly (see Figures 9 and 10 ). When we look at trajectories of cumulative cases and deaths in Figures 9 and 10 , in the worst-case scenario (the black curves) of the study, Turkey will have about 281,500 cases and 11,430 deaths. These projections decrease to 148,100 cases and 6,005 deaths if Turkey can increase the number of individuals in quarantine and the number of COVID-19 tests.",

In addition, while quarantine does not appear in the representation of R 0 , it still indirectly reduces R 0 . We also saw that the dynamics of the outbreak is very sensitive to the quarantine rate s q and contact rate \u03b2, as indicated by our sensitivity analysis. The basic reproductive number is estimated as 5.49 and the study shows that any change in \u03b2 or i q directly affects the basic reproductive number.",

Increasing (or decreasing) the speed of movement from the susceptible class to the quarantine class by about 10% would double (or half) the number of cases and deaths due to the outbreak (This speed of movement is controlled by the rate s q ). Of course, the efficiency of the quarantine is also very important. In our model, the efficiency of the quarantine measured by the reduction rate, r. The reduction rate shows how much reduction is effected in the contact of COVID-19 thanks to the quarantine. Based on our sensitivity analysis, this parameter is very important (see Figure 6 ). Our model shows that the quarantine in Hubei was almost perfect since it caused about 98.9 percent reduction in the contact rate of COVID-19.",

The daily number of tests given in Turkey is large when we compare to the rates of reported cases in Hubei. As we showed in the sensitivity analysis, increasing the number of COVID-19 tests and the number of individuals in quarantine will significantly reduce the number of cases (and deaths). Based on our forecasting, the number of cases will be about 203,700 with the range 148,100 and 281,500, and the number of deaths will be about 8,269 with the range 6,005 and 11,430 depending on quarantine rate, s q and the rate of reported cases, i q in Turkey. Thus, in any cases that are given in Figure 9 and 10, the fatality rate of COVID-19 will be about 4.1% in Turkey.",

The efficiency of the quarantine in Turkey is about 85 percent, meaning that it causes 85 percent reduction in the contact rate of COVID-19. Thus, the quarantine rate, s q and its efficiency is very important to be able to contain the outbreak (See Table 3 for reduction rate, r and Figure 6 for the effect of reduction rate in the total number of cases). As of April 10, 2020, the number of COVID-19 tests given each day in Turkey had increased to 30,000 ((Ministry of Health (Turkey), 2020)).
