The WHO, ECDC and CDC have issued conflicting guidelines on the use of respiratory filters (N95) by HCWs. We searched PubMed, Embase and The Cochrane Library from the inception to March 21, 2020 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing N95 respirators versus surgical masks for prevention of COVID-19 or any other respiratory infection among HCWs. The grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) was used to evaluate the quality of evidence. Four RCTs involving 8736 HCWs were included. We did not find any trial specifically on prevention of COVID-19.",

A protective effect of N95 respirators in laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR= 0.41; 95%CI 0.28-0.61) was also found. A trend in favour of N95 respirators was observed in preventing laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza like illness. We found no direct high quality evidence on whether N95 respirators are better than surgical masks for HCWs protection from SARS-CoV-2. However, low quality evidence suggests that N95 respirators protect HCWs from clinical respiratory infections. This finding should be contemplated to decide the best strategy to support the resilience of healthcare systems facing the potentially catastrophic SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",

            "text": "March [1] . As of 30 March 2020, a total of 693,224 cases and 33,106 deaths have been reported worldwide [2] . Nosocomial spread and infection of healthcare workers (HCWs) are a major concern. In Italy HCWs are paying a heavy price in addition to their professional and humanitarian efforts, with 8956 cases (more than 9% of total Italian cases [3] ) and 63 deaths[4] among physicians. Protecting HCWs from SARS-CoV-2 is therefore of great importance for individual HCW and for their role in fighting this devastating pandemic effectively. Claims of insufficient protection of HCWs by personal protective equipment, in particular with regards to the use of surgical masks, have fuelled the scientific and social media debate in Italy. In fact, except for aerosol generating procedures requiring higher level of respiratory protection with filtering respirators, WHO considers surgical masks adequate for the routine care of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients [5] . Instead, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the European Center for Disease Control guidelines (ECDC) have a more cautious approach, acknowledging that the exact role of airborne (aerosol) route in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still largely unknown [6, 7] . The direct evidence supporting the WHO guidelines is based on very few case reports on the absence of SARS-CoV-2 in air samples taken in highly protected environments where a rapid dilution of aerosols occurs, the absence of infection of HCWs exposed for a limited time or limited viral loads, or on modelling of epidemiologic patterns of transmission [8] [9] [10] [11] . In contrast, the airborne (aerosol) opportunistic route of transmission has been documented for SARS and MERS caused by closely related coronaviruses responsible of severe nosocomial infections among HCWs. Aerorsol filtering respirators were consequently recommended for SARS during 2002-03 outbreak [12] . It is worth remembering that Canadian Health authorities modified their earlier recommendations in favour of a more strict respiratory protection after the deaths of several HCWs [13] . The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols has been documented in experimental [14] and real life conditions in crowded, poorly ventilated hospital areas unrelated to aerosol generating procedures [15] .",

Indeed strengthening the preparedness and resiliency of health care systems to this pandemic crisis occurs not only avoiding SARS-CoV-2 infection but also preventing any HCW respiratory infection causing absenteeism from work. We therefore conducted a systematic review aimed at assessing the efficacy of N95 respirators versus surgical masks for the prevention of respiratory tract infections transmission among HCWs. The evidence from the review can then be used for the development of an appropriate GRADE framework for public health policy guidelines.",

In fact, these findings could be viewed as evidence against the benefit of respirators.

Regarding the lack of apparent benefit of N95 for influenza in the only trial where this outcome was assessed, both the outpatient setting (with lower viral exposure loads) [36] and the droplet route of transmission believed to be operative for influenza are worth of consideration.
