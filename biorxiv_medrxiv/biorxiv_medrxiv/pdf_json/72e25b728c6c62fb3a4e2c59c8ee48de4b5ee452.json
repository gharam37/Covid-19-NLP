The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) 3 originated from Wuhan a city in China is mutating while getting transmitted [3] . 4 Development of a potential drug or vaccine is a major challenge. The virus has RNA as 5 a genetic material and it gets mutated frequently. It is very important to understand 6 the evolutionary feature in the virus. Understanding the nature of mutation may help in 7 developing potential drug. Also, it may give direction to understand the next cycle of 8 mutation in the viral genome. Therefore, it is very important to understand the nature 9 of variation in different strains of the novel virus. 10 In this regard, few studies are conducted to understand the nature of variation in 11 this novel virus. Carmine and Federico [4] made an attempt to understand the 12 heterogeneity in 54 strains of this viral genome. Rahila et al. [16] studied impact of the 13 mutations in the spike glycoprotein function and stability in the novel virus.",

The MEGAX tool [11] has 22 been used to perform the analysis. It is based on Tamura-Nei model and 23 Neighbour-Joining method along with 100 bootstrap. This study adds up a novel 24 non-synonymous mutation 4809C>T (S1515F) in NSP3 gene only observed in strains 25 obtained from India. Various studies revealed that the NSP3 gene harbours many 26 mutations as this gene has been reported with extensive positive selection towards 27 evolution in Betacoronaviruses [18] , [7] . Common mutations among different strains 28 were also identified and reported. The sequence containing the mutation was used to 29 build protein model using SWISS-Model. Followed by the usage of the DynaMut tool to 30 study effect of mutation on protein stability. The results indicate the clade of variations 31 in the Indian SARS-CoV2. Also, potential region of mutations in near future along with 32 the effect of non-synonymous mutation at the protein level.

These mutations were 64 analysed in 28 submitted sequences from India. A previous report from India observed 65 unique mutation in spike protein (A930V (24351C>T)), this mutation was identified in 66 one (Sample 2) of the early infected patients' viral sequence [16] . The most common 67 SNP's that were observed in this analysis includes the previously reported mutation in 68 leader sequence (241C>T), Coronaviruses includes subgenomic identical 5 Leader 69 sequence which plays role in viral replication process. This mutation was seen to replicase-transcriptase complex at a very early stage of infection [8] . Spike protein has 89 been a hotspot in CoV2 genome since the beginning due to the presence of 90 receptor-binding domain. Contact point to the host includes the domains from S1 91 subunit of this S-protein [19] . The mutation observed 23403A>G (D614G) lies in tail 92 region of this S1 subunit and before the cleavage site of another subunit called S2 of 93 S-protein.

To identify the possible role and relevance of the region observing the 147 mutation, sequence alignment of NSP3 protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 was 148 performed. NSP3 gene along with NSP4 are the key players for membrane 149 rearrangement in form of Double Membrane Vesicles (DMV) upon infection [2] . Report 150 on role of mutations in important glycosylation sites in NSP4 gene in SARS-Cov have 151 been observed and were indicative of localisation problems with other NSP protein like 152 NSP3 [5] . As per this there will be a requirement to observe the site of novel change for 153 its impact on NSP3 gene interactions, which may even serve as a potential candidate for 154 therapeutics, depending upon the mutational effect shown in NSP4 [5] . The other 155 predictive outcome can come as benefit to virus in terms of interaction. recognize purine bases more strongly than pyrimidine bases [9] . Though the very crucial 162 role of SUD-C has not been recognised in SARS-CoV but in few reports SUD-C has 163 been shown to have RNA-binding ability, and concerted actions by the subdomains of 164 SUD have been proposed to ensure specific RNA binding [9] .The complete deletion of 165 the SUD-C domain within the context of a SARS-CoV was found to have large 166 reduction of RNA synthesis, but some basal RTC activity remains [12] . PDB blast 167 confirmed the presence of mutation in SUD domain of SARS-CoV with 74% identity to 168 2KAF (PDB-ID). Using Swiss model this particular domain was modelled for Reference 169 Wuhan sequence (NC 045521)and the change was observed by insilco protein stability 170 tool DynaMut [15] . The change was predicted to be stabilising by DynaMut and The novel Coronavirus, being identified as a global threat have been the prime focus of 178 research and investigation around the globe. Since its outbreak in Wuhan (China) it has 179 taken up several changes to keep the survival high. There are reports by several groups 180 on mutations observed in the strains from different countries [16] [20] [16] . Here, in this 181 study, the primary focus is on strains submitted by India. The country is suspected to 182 have more number of positive cases than actually reported and also, there is increase in 183 the number of cases despite the lockdown implemented by the government. With cause of this is unclear, but there is a possibility as per previous report that patient 195 ",

This same infected person has another notable 196 change of three consecutive positions (28881G>A, 28882G>A, and 28883G>C) 197 reported mainly in the US. To an extent it clears the doubt that person might have 198 contracted multiple strains (Asian and American), thereby carrying both S and L types 199 of strain along with the US reported mutation. L-type was found to be more aggressive 200 strain before Jan 2020 [17] . People who might have contracted this patient would have 201 been at higher risk of infection. In phylogenetic tree analysis these two strains could be 202 observed without branching from the ancestral strain and in vicinity to reference strain 203 sequence (NC 045512) Figure 2 . tourists (Sample 5 to Sample 9), the person (Sample 4) who had contracted with Italian 220 tourist and 6 (Sample 11 to Sample 16) of the Vero CCL81 isolate P1 sequenced in India. 221 It seems to be absent in the strain sequenced from patient with travel history to Italy. 222 One probable explanation to this novel non-synonymous change could be related to 223 its increased transmission rate since it is being observed to be incorporated in 224 combination with already co-existing mutations [20] . The mutation was predicted with 225 stabilising effect, hence no change at secondary structure level was observed Figure 3 .",

Until now no strain has been declared more lethal in comparison 261 with other, but transmission has been the prime observation, which to an extent could 262 be controlled by social distancing mechanism. This speculation is being made from the 263 very early observations and based on what has been the mutational trend in and around 264 the world.
