These samples can comprise hundreds of organisms that can be closely or very distantly related in the taxonomic tree of life. DNA metabarcoding combines polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), whereby a short, homologous sequence of DNA is amplified and sequenced from all members of the community. Sequences are then taxonomically identified based on their match to a reference database. Ideally, each species of interest would have a unique DNA barcode. This short, variable sequence needs to be flanked by relatively conserved regions that can be used as primer binding sites. Appropriate PCR primer pairs would match to a broad evolutionary range of taxa, such that we only need a few to achieve high taxonomic coverage. At the same time however, the DNA barcodes between primer pairs should be different to allow us to distinguish between species to improve resolution. This poses an interesting optimization problem. More specifically: Given a set of references R = {R 1 , R 2 , ..., R m }, the problem is to find a primer set P balancing both: high taxonomic coverage and high resolution. This goal can be captured by filtering for frequent primers and ranking by coverage or variation, i.e. the number of unique barcodes. Here we present the software PriSeT, an offline primer discovery tool that is capable of processing large libraries and is robust against mislabeled or low quality references. It tackles the computationally expensive steps with linear runtime filters and * Equal contribution 1 Institute of Computer Science, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Takustr. 9, 14195 Berlin, Germany 2 Institute for Biology, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, K\u00f6nigin-Luise-Str. 1-3, 14195 Berlin, Germany 3 Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB), M\u00fcggelseedamm 301, 12587 Berlin, Germany.

For 11 clades we found de novo primer pairs that cover more taxa than the published ones, and for six clades de novo primers resulted in greater sequence (i.e., DNA barcode) variation.

            "text": "In metagenomics, the DNA of hundreds to thousands of species from a single environmental sample is processed in parallel and one goal is to identify all species from a sample. Samples contain many species in what can be very heterogeneous communities. Their identification is usually done via DNA metabarcoding which combines polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) and identification via DNA barcodes, i.e. short sequences that are matched against a reference database. In contrast, single DNA probing and assembly would be more precise, but are for many reasons not feasible, e.g., the majority of microorganisms cannot be clonally cultured -a necessity for assembling reference genomes (Rapp\u00e9 & Giovannoni, 2003) . Although the decreasing costs of NGS makes DNA metabarcoding progressively feasible, identification of most microeukaryotes, such as plankton, continues to be done via morphology. This still outperforms molecular methods in some aspects, like abundance estimation, differentiation of life stages, or observation of teratological forms. But metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) is a far more sensitive method of species detection compared to traditional methods (Smart et al., 2015) provided that a suitable marker is chosen. In the search for a marker, we know that evolutionary pressure is not consistent within genomes. There are regions that vary even within species, or on the other extreme, are conserved for whole clades. For an effective delineation of taxa using DNA metabarcodes, we are interested in regions that are similar or identical to individuals of the same species, but distinctive from other species. Such regions are ideal barcodes, but they need to be surrounded by conserved regions that contain suitable binding sites for primers. Primers are short oligomers, ideally 16 to 25 bases long, which determine the copy starting point of the template. We need flanking conservation, because we batch-process all extracted DNA at once and can add only one primer pair per PCR run 1 . The most frequently applied type of NGS in DNA metabarcoding is the paired-end approach as it allows for longer sequences and error correction for the low quality ends of reads. The two types of primers operate independently, one binds on the forward and the other on the reverse strand of the template. Both are elongated enzymatically to produce a complementary copy. In each PCR cycle the number of amplicons is nearly duplicated. After about 25-35 cycles the reaction is stopped and the amplified DNA amplicons provide a signal for the sequencer machine that is separable from the noise of the original DNA material. After digitization of the reads, an analysis pipeline combines trimming, quality filtering, denoising, and read merging with the aforementioned error correction. Identical or similar sequences are then clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The underlying hypothesis is that each OTU corresponds to a taxon in the tree of life. An alternative approach is that each sequence variant is analysed rather than being clustered into OTUs. The art herein is to discriminate sequencing errors from variants. A noteworthy denoising algorithm is the Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm 2 (DADA 2) (Callahan et al., 2016) . As described earlier, not all barcodes are specific to a single species and our metabarcoding pipeline will most likely produce OTUs uniting barcodes from taxonomically distinct lineages, even with similarity thresholds set high (i.e., > 97 %). Despite these natural imperfections, ecologists found that the small subunit RNA gene (SSU) is an excellent source for species-specific markers. Hence a large number of entries in the NCBI-GenBank nucleotide database originate from ribosomal subunits (Benson et al., 2012) . Schmidt et al. (2014) demonstrated that OTUs from 16S/18S rRNA reflect the underlying ecological diversity consistently across habitats. In other words, even if OTUs cannot be resolved, their counts correlate to the sample's diversity and are roughly independent from the species composition. Finding the optimal set of primers in terms of coverage and resolution takes many costly iterations of trial and error (Elbrecht et al., 2019) . Scientists encounter problems like missing ground truth and sparsely populated reference databases. Often they would start with primer sequences published in previous studies on similar data sets and then compare OTU diversity between different primer sets. More formally, primer candidates can be described as kmers -DNA oligomers of length k -satisfying a set of sequence constraints C s which are relevant for the success of the PCR and which must hold independent of their matching. C s comprises range limits for melting temperature, CG content or low probabilities for self-annealing. When combining two k-mers to produce a primer pair, both have to fulfill a second set of constraints C p arising from their strand orientation and fitting: avoidance of CG clamps or low probability of cross-annealing.",

Needless to say that in metagenomics this approach is only chosen post experimentum when analysing organism groups that turned out to be difficult to detect with PCR. Online tools like Primer Blast/Primer3 3 (Ye et al., 2012) take off the burden to locally set up a software system by providing primer searches as on online service.

The online tool allows the upload of files containing multiple references, but produces errors when header lines contain special characters or sequences contain ambiguous one-letter encodings. A file of 114 KB sequences took 40 seconds to be processed including network traffic 5 . It outputs primer pairs scored by chemical fitness, but does not optimize towards coverage or amplicon variation. PRIMEX (Lexa & Valle, 2004) is intended to provide querying as an online service. The tool performs internally a lookup of k-mers derived from the query string in a prepared library and allows for mismatches. Unfortunately, PRIMEX is currently not available and it is not capable of discovering new primer sequences 6 . One of the few standalone tools is FastPCR (Kalendar et al., 2017) . It supports a variety of PCR protocols and chemical checks. It first computes a hash table with k-mers grouped together by overlap into so called k-tuples with k being 7, 9, or 12 nt long. The derivation of these k-tuples is not described. In a second step, FastPCR uses a sliding window approach to search for matches between k-tuples and reference sequences. Upon match, individual k-tuples are extended in both directions. FastPCR has no preference for frequent k-mers -it is designed to work on single genomes. The authors are not aware of a primer discovery tool suitable for metabarcoding experiments where the aim is a high taxonomic coverage and barcode variation and the input is a directory or source file composed of thousands of reference sequences. Before we explain in detail the data structures and algorithm to solve the problem of primer discovery, we give definitions of some concepts that are essential to make our approach time-efficient.",

Applying the filter directly after the frequency step helps to reduce the number of k-mers by orders of magnitudes before running the combine procedure. The constraints C s that are currently checked by PriSeT are amplicon length range, melting temperature, CG content, mono-or dinucleotide runs, and self-annealing patterns (see Table 2 ). amplicon ranges are constricted, because we first need to ensure that reads will overlap for the read merging step in a metabarcoding pipeline, and secondly, reads are usually trimmed to the same length -a precondition for most OTU clustering algorithms. The melting temperature in a PCR corresponds to the state where half of the DNA duplexes will be dissociated. Only when template DNA is single stranded, primer sequences can bind and the enzymatically driven elongation can take place. The temperature for the denaturation phase can be adjusted, but too high temperatures will lead to irreversible damage of the ingredients. Another criterion for primers being not too associative to the template is their CG content. Not only are C-G bonds twice as strong as A-T bonds, they are also more prone to mis-pairing. The recommended range is 40 -60 % in proportion to their length. Mono-or dinucleotide runs are patterns where a single nucleotide or dinucleotide occurs consecutively repeated, i.e. \u03c3 x or (\u03c3 1 \u03c3 2 ) x with \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3, \u03c3 1 = \u03c3 2 , and x \u2208 N . These patterns tend to misprime. A maximal accepted number is four. Self-annealing (or self-dimerization) occurs when copies of a primer form stable dimers. If their binding energy is relatively high, a significant amount will rather bind to primers than to the template and thereby deteriorating template am-.

One k-mer will be determined to be the forward primer on the minus strand from 5' to 3' direction, and the second k-mer the reverse primer on the plus strand. As mentioned earlier, denaturation and annealing phase temperatures can be adjusted, but we need to ensure that roughly the same amount of forward and reverse primers are dissociated to produce similar amounts of PCR products by allowing not more than five Kelvin differences in their melting temperatures. GC clamp refers to the amount of CG in the 5'-end of a primer. Especially at the 5'-end where the elongation takes place, a primer should bind stably, but not too strongly. Since C and G bind twice as strong as A or T, ideally one or two nucleotides should be C or G, but the last three should not be exclusively A or T (AT tail).

The reduction to the four basic nucleotides is justified by the observation that substrings containing ambiguous nucleotides are meaningless, since a single mismatch between primer and template may lead to an amplification failure.

We use two data structures per reference -a list to store the set of TKMerIDs in order of occurrence and a compact data structure in form of a bit vector B in the length of the last k-mer occurrence. A set bit indicates the presence of a TKMerID. I.e., the i-th set bit in B corresponds to the i-th TKMerID in the KMerIDs list. The compact data structure is augmented with rank 1 and select 1 support, which have O(1) runtime for queries 10 . Figure 3 illustrates the k-mer combination search over the transformed reference.",

For each taxon within a clade that contained at least one accession assigned to it, we sampled at most three accessions to remove the sequence bias introduced by highly populated taxa. Table 4 lists the clades, the number of taxa, taxa with at least one accession (Covered), the total number of accessions and the library size in megabytes (MB).

Their role in ecosystem function and for environmental monitoring and water quality assessment cannot be underestimated -they contribute approximately 20 % of global oxygen production and represent nearly half of the organic material in the oceans.

Some of these primers were designed with respect to a specific organism group, however, it is expected that they are also effective in other clades. Table 5 lists the 10 selected primer pairs targeting 18S that we searched for in the reference library. It is remarkable that not a single pair has chemically optimal properties. At least one sequence of a pair shows a self-annealing pattern, seven pairs differ significantly in melting temperatures (independent of computation method, i.e. Wallace rule or nearestneighbour method), three sequences have CG clamps at their 3' ends, eight sequences have exceeding CG contents, 23S forward contains a run of five adenine bases (R substitutes A or G), and SSU911R has an (A|T) 3 tail. We therefore relaxed the chemical constraints for the verification experiment by allowing a larger melting temperature range and difference in \u2206Tm, a larger CG content range, and we deactivated the self-annealing filter (see column 'Verification' in Table 6 ).",

For example, for Charophyceae (clade 304574), the highest ranked primer by coverage is d8d47dc9b873d02b -a de novo computed primer, and the highest ranked published primer is EUK14. In the joint set, however, there are more de novo primer pairs that have a higher rank than EUK14, but are not reported here for the sake of briefty. When ranking by coverage, for 11 out of 19 clades a de novo primer outperformed all published primers. Since coverage optimizes towards broadness and variation towards amplicon distinguishability, we expect that the top primers for the two ranking methods may differ. In 14 out of 38 cases the top primers of the de novo or published sets are identical. In 24 cases higher variation is paid with lower coverage and vice versa.

A single clade or synthetic data set would produce non-representative, and even misleading results. For example clade 6657 has a library being 7 MB larger than the one of clade 3041. Surprisingly, clade 6657 produces only 4.83 million k-mers, compared to 43,9 million k-mers of clade 3041 (see Figure 7 ). For the largest data set (clade 451864 of Dikarya), we had to raise the frequency cutoff to 10 %, for not running into memory issues caused by the vast amount of k-mers (see Discussion 5). We sorted the data sets by size (abscissa) and log 2 -scaled abscissa and ordinate for readability. The total runtime for the smallest data set Perkinsidae (clade 27999 with 0.13 MB) is \u2264 1 second, for Fungi (clade 112252 with 10.21 MB) 33 seconds, and for a large dataset like Nematoda (clade 6231 with 82.55 MB) 70 min. The frequency computation contributes the most to the total runtime. This is due to the large number of possible k-mers within a library. After the filter & transform step the number of k-mers is reduced drastically, s.t. the expensive combine step with a runtime in the size of all k-mer positions times the window size remains relatively low. The k-mer dropout rate during filter & transform and combine is highly dependent on the sequence structure within the clades as indicated by the non-linearity of filter & transform and combine runtimes in proportion to the original library size. Theoretical upper limits can be seen in Table 9 . The frequency computation performs a single k-mer look-up in O(k) where k is the length of the k-mer to be looked up. Additionally, all occurrence locations need to be gathered, which depend on the number of occurrences occ and the total library length N . This can be done in O(k + occ) by exploiting the lexicographical ordering of the index (Ferragina & Manzini, 2000) . Taking into account at most N \u2212 k + 1 different k-mers, the upper limit is O(N (k + occ)) (see Table 9 ). All chemical filters in the filter & transform step analyse the encoded sequences in a single-or multi-pass fashion. Some require simple counting (Tm, CG content) or pattern match (dinucleotide runs, (A|T) 3 tails). The most complex one is the self-annnealing filter in which a k-mer is shifted at most 2k times and XORed against its complement or reverse complement. The identification of a connected self-annealing pattern of size four (corresponding to a 0b11111111 pattern) can be done in constant time by using bit parallelism (see code on GitHub for details). Filtering is done on at most N k-mers, giving us a total runtime of O(kN ). For storing the bit vector transformed references, and the ranked TKmerIDs we need O(N ) space. During the combine step we additionally store matching k-mers. A reference has an expected length of N n bases. For each forward k-mer we search with an offset of \u03c4 min a candidates' window of size \u03c4 max \u2212 \u03c4 min . Hence, we have at most O(( N n \u2212 \u03c4 min )(\u03c4 max \u2212 \u03c4 min )) pairs per reference (\u03ba min , \u03ba max are dropped here). For each pair a matchability check is done linear in the expected length of the two k-mers, i.e. in O(k) (see C p in Table 2 ). Altogether we have n references, giving us a total combination runtime of O(nk( N n \u2212 \u03c4 min )(\u03c4 max \u2212 \u03c4 min )). Space occupancy is linear for the FM index, frequency, and filter & transform steps. Per text position we use at most one 64 bit unsigned integer independent of how many k-mers with varying lengths occur at a specific position (see compression scheme described in Section 3.3.1) and",

            "text": "Despite the reference database has a low sequence coverage for plankton taxa, we found some new primer pairs offering a larger coverage or barcode variation than published ones and are chemically suitable for a paired-end PCR (see Table  2 ). PriSeT correctly output primer pairs that are known to be present in the library if and only if they pass the constraint sets C s and C p (see Table 2 ). When having complete genomes available for primer discovery too many candidates are produced and it is necessary to narrow down the primer sequence constraints or filter in a post-processing step, e.g., for pairs producing amplicons that are distinctive or span exons. The experiments showed that when searching primer pairs for metabarcoding experiments, it is appropriate to use frequency as an initial filtering heuristic. Only k-mers occurring with a minimum frequency will later satisfy sufficient coverage or amplicon variation. The FM index is a transformation that supports frequency queries with lower costs compared to a seed-and-extend approach, e.g. FastPCR by Kalendar et al. (2017) , or a MSA-based approach, which requires manageable data sets in order to identify conserved regions serving as primer binding sites. None of the existing primer search tools that we found is capable of processing multi-sequence libraries and optimizing for frequent primer pairs at the same time. PriSeT is built to fill this gap. Its heuristic approach additionally avoids the necessity to curate an existing library and makes it robust against mislabeled or poor quality references. This in turn gives users more resources to focus on the actual analysis. With sinking costs of NGS, databases are growing on a daily basis, making curation even infeasible and with regard to the sparseness of some clades, we cannot afford to exclude resources. Since GenBank has no standard specification for labeling sequences by their origin upon upload (e.g. as 18S or COI), our sampling approach also collected non-18S sequences, which explains the relatively low values for coverage and amplicon variation. When a user evaluates PriSeT's computed primer pairs and their statistics, the heterogeneity of the database has to be taken into consideration. The PriSeT version at hand does not include coverage or amplicon variation criteria into the filtering for not limiting options -the benefit of a higher coverage is in many cases paid with a lower number of distinct reads (see results in Table 8 ). We leave it up to the user to decide when coverage is favored over amplicon variation and vice versa. However, the recent coronavirus outbreak demonstrated the importance of scenarios where the goal is to yield barcodes being discriminators of clades.",

            "text": "PriSeT operates batch-wise, i.e. all k-mers with frequencies exceeding are collected at once into a single data structure, filtered chemically, and combined reference-wise. To give an example, Dikarya from the Fungi realm (clade 451864) produces 119.4 million k-mers. The main memory occupation of the location map received from GenMap represents the current bottleneck of PriSeT. Processing libraries beyond 500 MB is currently only feasible when increasing the k-mer frequency cutoff, s.t. not more than roughly 120 million k-mers (\u2248 1 Gigabyte) are produced 16 . In a future PriSeT version this can be tackled by interweaving k-mer frequency and filtering: a frequent k-mer immediately undergoes filtering, and is only collected when satisfying the frequency threshold and constraint set C s . This reduces the overall amount of temporarily stored k-mers. Input libraries composed of multiple reference sequences would additionally profit from reference-wise partitioning approach. This strategy can be carried on to the combine step, since k-mers are only combinable if they refer to the same sequence; each of the references is processible in parallel. The current version of PriSeT does not use any thread or process parallelism. The computationally most expensive part of PriSeT is the combine step with a runtime quadratic in N where the window size plays in. It is therefore important to set the target read lengths sizes as tight as possible (see Table 9 ). Stable binding of primer to template is crucial for the success of a PCR. A single mismatch, especially at the 3'-end, may result in an ineffective PCR. On that account PriSeT is using the (k, 0)-frequency to gather only k-mer locations with 100 % sequence identity. A future version of PriSeT may allow for up to four errors e (or mismatches) for primer sequences in case there are calls for it. When allowing errors, a single k-mer occurrence is counted into all location collections associated to k-mers with Hamming distances \u2264 e. This has a huge impact on the collection sizes and will have to be chosen carefully. In metabarcoding we are sometimes interested in primer pairs enclosing barcodes which allow guaranteed distinction of species from clade X from species of another clade Y. If we take as an example the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, one question is, given a sputum sample of a person with flu-like symptoms, does it contain viruses of influenza or corona?
