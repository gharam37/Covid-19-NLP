This epidemic wave will only begin to roll back once a critical proportion of the population is immunised, either by mounting natural immunity following infection, or by vaccination. The latter option can minimise the cost in terms of human lives but it requires to wait until a safe and efficient vaccine is developed, a period estimated to last at least 18 months. In this work, we use optimal control theory to explore the best strategy to implement while waiting for the vaccine. We seek a solution minimizing deaths and costs due to the implementation of the control strategy itself. We find that such a solution leads to an increasing level of control with a maximum reached near the fourth month of the epidemics and a steady decrease until vaccine deployment. This strategy strongly outperforms others with constant or cycling allocations of the same amount of resources to control the outbreak. This work opens new perspectives to mitigate the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics, and be used as a proof-of-concept in using mathematical modelling techniques to enlighten decision making and public health management in the early times of an outbreak.",

The first one is through natural immunisation: once a proportion 1\u22121/R 0 of the population has been infected (where R 0 is the basic reproduction number), a 'herd immunity' develops and the epidemic starts to decrease [1] . Note that this herd immunity threshold is lower than the 'worst-case scenario', i.e. the epidemics final size if no containment measure is implemented [13] . The second option is to achieve population immunisation through vaccination. The threshold to have the epidemics decrease remains the same, but the cost in terms of mortality can be much lower. These options have been investigated by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Modelling in two reports [7, 24] . The first report explores the effect of an on/off triggering of 5 types of non-pharmaceutical interventions, whereas the second report compares a containment strategy to a suppression strategy, while factoring in indirect costs of implementing the strategy. Other models have explored the efficiency of contact tracing to mitigate the epidemics [11, 12] .",

We therefore focus on a finite time interval [0, T ], where T is the number of days required for vaccine discovery, manufacturing and deployment. Our key metric is the fraction c of decrease in R 0 (or, equivalently, in the contact rate) obtained through non-pharmaceutical interventions, which we refer to as control intensity. Importantly, the model considers that implementing the control policy comes with a cost, which corresponds to diverting funding from important sources or to social deleterious effects, and can cause indirect mortality. Optimal control theory allows us to find the optimal control strategy over time, denoted by c(t), that minimises the cumulative sum of these costs over the [0, T ] period of time. We compare this strategy to scenarios without any control or with more homogeneous control (i.e. with c alternating between constant values at a given frequency) that involve the same average effort over time as the optimal strategy. We find that the optimal control strategy outperforms the others in terms of direct and indirect mortality.",

We assume that severe symptomatic infections (I s ) require hospitalisation, which reduces their contagiousness. The main variables and parameters of the model are listed in Table 1 and shown in Figure 1 . The case-fatality ratio (\u03b8) and the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of the epidemic are known from the literature [5, 6, 16, 25] .

The idea is to capture the reaction of several countries that have first implemented strict containment strategies that cannot be sustained for a long period of time. In order to facilitate comparisons between scenarios, the fixed constant control corresponds to the average of optimal control c * . The initial strict control is assumed and it should be even easier to decrease deaths (since we control more). With this strategy, the epidemic peak is strongly delayed compared to the scenario without any control (Figure 2b) . However, the cumulative number of deaths at the end of the period of interest is very similar to the scenario without control, both for the direct deaths caused by COVID-19 infections and for the indirect deaths caused by the saturation of the healthcare system (Figure 2c,d) .",

As a consequence, corresponding optimal controls can be very intense (Figure 3a ) and further decrease severe cases and deaths ( Figure  3b,c) . On the other hand, large values of B correspond to situations where control measures are \"expensive\" for the population, making strict public health measures unsustainable at the population level. In this case, control intensities remain intermediate (Figure 3a) , with more infections and deaths compared to cases with smaller values of B (Figure 3b,c) .
