Different states have adopted measures to stop the community spread. Considering the vast size of the country, the population size and other socio-economic conditions of the states, a single uniform policy may not work to contain the disease.

This viral disease as well as the causative agent is novel entry to the viral world and hence is posing unforeseen challenges. SARS-Cov-2, commonly known as N o v e l Coronavirus, is a single, positive-stranded, RNA virus belonging to order Nidovirales (Cascella, 2020) (Peeri, et al., 2020) . Both these viruses emerged from animal reservoirs to cause global epidemics with alarming morbidity and mortality (Chavang, 2007) . The reservoirs of the Novel Coronavirus are mostly animals found in the wild. Scientists also believe that peri-domestic mammals may also serve as For long, human viruses have not been considered severe pathogens as infected people develop flu like symptoms and then get cured on their own as innate immune system triggers antibody formation that provides resistance against the diseases (Chiu, 2013; Kistler et al., 2007; Wrammert et al., 2008) . In both developed and developing countries the signs of common flu have not been a cause of concern though some vaccines have been developed recently and elderly are advised to take shots yearly as they have compromised immune systems (Voordouw et al., 2004) . However, the spread of Novel Covid-19 has alarmed people all over the world. It is important to understand how the virus will fare in the alien environments. Therefore, interdisciplinary research involving biologists, data scientists, mathematicians, clinicians is required in order to work towards stopping the spread of these diseases and design appropriate methods, drugs to contain it before the situation gets out of hand.",

Basic symptoms resemble the normal flu-like symptoms that can result in cough, cold, headache and body ache. The more severe consequences include acute respiratory tract infections that culminate into pneumonia (WHO report, 2020). In more severe cases, especially old people also develop secondary infections that start affecting other vital organs and in worst cases leading to death of any individuals which can be cured for most infected individuals (Xu et al., 2020) . The fast pace at which it is spreading from human to human contact is the current major reason of worry, and this what we show through a concise mathematical model in this paper. The infections can spread through air (if the infected individual is less than one meter apart from uninfected individuals), mostly through the droplets of infected people since the virus stays alive in droplets on the surfaces for many days. As soon as it gets into the host, it replicates in the body, and the body becomes a reservoir (Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020).",

The rise in population has already created crisis for health sector, education and has caused poverty elevation. With the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Covid-19, the country must gear up to confront it. It is important for Indian Scientists to come together and study the pathogenicity in the Indian context. In India, the first case was reported in the end of January this year, and the number has grown to touch 800 as on March 28, 2020. But India is a peninsula and the temperature, humidity and topography is variable, hence the factoring of variables will also have an implication on mortality and morbidity. Also, education, awareness and understanding of people, socio-economic status is variable, so the infection percentage, the magnitude of impact will also be different. This calls for regional data assessment and modelling. Besides, mathematical and ecological modelling can help in predicting the disease course. The data generator through these models can consider various variables that are specific to the country and give some predictions. This can help in a fair assessment and put all the fake and unscientific assumptions on hold. This data can also help in giving recommendations to the health care agencies. Brockmann, 2020).

Once a larger fraction of the population has gone through the infection and has become immune, the probability of an infected person transmitting the infection decreases. But as shown in the previous figures, in every transmission from person to person, the numbers increase exponentially, and we would not have enough hospitals beds, medical staff and equipment to treat all infected individuals if exponentially increasing number of people have to be admitted in hospitals every day! We cannot risk such a situation because any healthcare system (of even the richest and most developed country) will breakdown and we would have unnecessary deaths. As humans, we have the knowledge to overcome such situations. We have the knowledge of science, and we should use this to avoid unnecessary deaths. This is where the second option becomes important to practice, that is 2) physical distancing to ensure we do not spread (or receive) the virus to (or from) other people. This way, the virus surviving within the bodies of already infected individuals can no longer survive by jumping to other persons. The viruses would stop surviving in the infected persons' bodies after its 14-day incubation period in that host. This way, we can reduce the number of deaths, and also reduce the number of infected by blocking the virus from spreading.",

This has happened in Maharashtra even when the state has not been the first one to get the infection in India.

People who are showing anxiety symptoms due to restrictions and lock downs need constant counselling. Psychologists, self-help groups need to offer counselling through electronic media. Indians also need to fight the menace of superstitions and myths that are being propagated regarding the cure of Corona related illness. Scientists need to gear up for the task and come forward to do collaborative research work to understand the spread, containment and eventualities of the pandemic outbreak. For this, interdisciplinary teams must work together to come out with some concrete strategy. Research teams have to develop vaccines for which funding, infrastructure, and adequate facilities are required. So, Covid-19 is a reminder that science cannot take a back seat and health care, education and research should always hold a top priority. Faith in science and scientists, and optimism is important at this juncture so that India comes out as a winner in the battle.",

Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, virus evolution, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfillment by future studies. Research teams including biologists, biotechnologists and medical practitioners all over the world are trying to understand biology, etiology and epidemiology of the diseases (Novel, C. P. E. R.
