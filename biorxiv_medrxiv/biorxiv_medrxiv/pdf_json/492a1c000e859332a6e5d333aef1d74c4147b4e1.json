Government of different countries have developed and adopted various policies to contain this epidemic and the most common were the social distancing and lockdown. We proposed a SEIR epidemic model that accommodates the effects of lockdown and individual based precautionary measures and used it to estimate model parameters from the epidemic data up to 2nd April, 2020, freely available in GitHub repository for COVID-19, for nine developed and developing countries. We used the estimated parameters to predict the disease burden in these countries with special emphasis on India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Our analysis revealed that the lockdown and recommended individual hygiene can slow down the outbreak but unable to eradicate the disease from the society. With the current human-to-human transmission rate and existing level of personal precautionary, the number of infected individuals in India will be increasing at least for the next 3 months and the peak will come in 5 months. We can, however, reduce the epidemic size and prolong the time to arrive epidemic peak by seriously following the measures suggested by the authorities. We need to wait for another one month to obtain more data and epidemiological parameters for giving a better prediction about the pandemic. It is to be mentioned that research community is working for drugs and/ or vaccines against COVID19 and the presence of such pharmaceutical interventions will significantly alter the results.",

The entire human population of a country was classified into four compartments, viz. susceptible population (who are supposed to be infected by the disease), exposed population (who have contacted the disease but not yet infectious), infective population (who are capable of spreading the disease), recovered population (who have recovered from the disease and no more infectious) to construct a SEIR (susceptible (S) \u2192 exposed (E) \u2192 infectious (I) \u2192 recovered (R)) model. The model was further extended to accommodate a death class (D) (who have died due to this disease) for assessing the reported death 28 due to coronavirus. The rate of change in each compartment at time t is represented by the following set of differential equations,",

The effect of the parameter \u03b2 is directly related with the measures like lockdown, restriction of movement, shaking hand etc. which actually reduce the number of contacts. While the parameter w(0 < w < 1) encapsulates the efficacy of various individual precautionary measures, like cough etiquettes, frequent washing of hand with soap and sanitizer etc. Usually, incidence rate (the rate at which susceptible become infective) in epidemiological models is considered as bilinear (proportional to the product of S and I) type, also called mass-action type. This assumption is valid when there is a small number of infective, however, this law fails as the infective numbers increases 29 , because the per capita contacts decreases with increasing I. It is therefore assumed that the disease incidence is of nonlinear and of mass-action saturated type, which behaves like bilinear type incidence when I is small and saturates as I increases 30, 31 . It is also shown that this nonlinear incidence better fit the epidemiological data compared to bilinear incidence 32 . The nonnegative parameter, \u03b1 measures the extent of physiological effect. Exposed individuals progress to infectious class at a rate \u03b3, thus the average time spent in the exposed class is 1 \u03b3 unit of time. Infectious individuals either recover at a rate \u03b4 or die at a rate \u00b5, implying the mean infectious period is 1 \u03b4 +\u00b5 unit of time. The total population, N, is assumed to be constant for a designated area so that normal birth and death balance each other in the study period.",

It shows that the efficacy of various individual level measures, like washing of hand and using of mask, is more in USA and Europe than in South Asian countries. This is expected because of the difference in the socio-economic conditions of these countries. But, it was interesting to note that the daily contact (n) is low in developing nation in comparison to developed countries with India at the lowest and Spain at the highest position. One probable reason for such result is that India announced lockdown much earlier than USA and other countries after the detection of first positive case. This restricted the person-to-person transmission significantly in India, breaking the chain. The trend, however, may change if violation of lockdown occurs and/or detection processes is not rapidly",

We varied the said parameters and calculated the fold change in infected, recovered and death cases of each country after one month, considering the data of 2nd April as their respective base values. Here we have presented the results of USA and Italy (Fig. 3) , and India (Fig. 4) . Similar results for rest of the countries are given in the supplementary (Figs. S4-S6 ). All the countries showed a declined trend in infected numbers with the decreasing rate of human-to-human transmission, however, the rate differed from country to country. The individual precautionary measures, w, is high for the European countries and USA and so for these countries there is little scope for any further increase in w. However, the estimated value of w for South Asian countries is too low and there is a huge scope for increasing the value of w with good hygiene practice.",

The time series data, starting from 22nd January to till 2nd April, 2020, for both the developed and developing countries were taken into consideration for the estimation of country-wise parameter values. We then varied the estimated parameter values to see their effect on the course of epidemic in each country. The effect of lockdown and personal hygiene, which affect the human-to-human transmission at the community level and household level, were considered in the model through the parameters \u03b2 and w. As expected, lockdown and individual hygiene measures had shown their influences in reducing the epidemic burden in all nine countries. Looking at the country-wise prevalence percentage for the next three months, we observed that disease burden will decline in all the four considered European countries except UK. The situation of USA is almost similar to UK, where disease prevalence will be around 25%. At the current infection rate, India and Pakistan will reach their peak with disease prevalence around 60% and 70%, respectively, after 150 and 85 days. Bangladesh will attain its epidemic peak much later. The best part in Bangladesh is that the highest disease prevalence is lower than 9%, which however may be the result of small amount of data availability. We were more interested to see the effect of lockdown and individual precautionary measures on India and Pakistan, though the latter is yet to go for complete lockdown. With the existing contact rate, the epidemic in Pakistan is going to affect around 70% of its population in the coming 3 months, where as 3% of Indian population will be affected by the disease in the same duration. However, the number of infective in India will exponentially grow in the next 2 months and the disease prevalence may be about 60% of the total population. To decrease the prevalence percentage to 0.03% in next 3 months, Pakistan has to reduce the human-to-human transmission rate to one-fifth of the current value, while for India it can be achieved by reducing it to half of the existing rate. Lockdown not only reduces the size of epidemic but also causes delay in the occurrence of peak. The length of delay increases further if the individual level precautionary measures are increased, see Fig. 7 .",

Our 2D parameter space analysis showed the existence of such parametric region (the green colour portion in Fig 8) even when there is no pharmaceutical intervention. Number of infected population would decrease from its current value after one month if the parameters (\u03b2 and w) attain their values from the green zone.
