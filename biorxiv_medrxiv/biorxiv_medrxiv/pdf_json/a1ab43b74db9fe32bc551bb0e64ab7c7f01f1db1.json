The duration of scholarly journals' publication process is one of the main factors hindering quick delivery of new information. While proper editorial assessment and peer review obviously require some time, turnaround times for medical journals can be up to several months, which is undesirable in the era of a crisis. Following initiatives of medical journals and scholarly publishers to accelerate their publication process, this study assesses whether medical journals have indeed managed to speed up their publication process for Covid-19 related articles. It studies the duration of 14 medical journals' publication process both during and prior to the current pandemic. Assessing a total of 669 articles, the study concludes that medical journals have indeed drastically accelerated the publication process for Covid-19 related articles since the outbreak of the pandemic. Compared to articles published in the same journals before the pandemic, turnaround times have decreased on average by 49%. The largest decrease in number of days between submission and publication of articles was due to a decrease in the number of days required for peer review.",

In a meta-analysis including over 2700 journal articles, Bj\u00f6rk and Solomon (2013) find considerable differences in turnaround times (i.e. the period between submission and publication of a journal article, sometimes also called 'publication delays') between research disciplines.

From an author perspective, commentators are reporting a sharp increase in the use of preprint servers. On these online platforms, authors upload their manuscript, making it publicly accessible immediately upon finalization of the text (Gunnarsdottir, 2005) . Because no review, editorial assessment or copyediting takes place, manuscripts can be made accessible without publication delay. However, as manuscripts are only reviewed once they are available for anybody to read and use, scholars warn for potentially incorrect results spreading without editorial assessment filtering them. In fact, several cases of invalid research regarding Covid-19 being published as preprints have already been reported (Heimst\u00e4dt, 2020; Marcus & Oransky, 2020) . It should be noted though that this is not specific to preprints, as journal articles can require from post-publication corrections and retractions as well (Horbach & Halffman, 2019) . Several articles related to Covid-19 have already gone through this process (Gautret et al., 2020) .",

Similarly, Nature put out an open invitation to researchers with relevant expertise to review Covid-19 related papers over short time (\"Coronavirus pandemic: Nature's pledge to you,\" 2020).

The articles were published in 14 different journals. Journals were selected based on their number of articles both prior to and during the current pandemic as well as the availability of data on when articles were submitted, accepted and published. We selected the ten journals publishing most Covid-19 related articles in general, supplemented by the five journals publishing most Covid-19 related content since the start of the pandemic, that make publication data (submission, acceptance and publish) available. One journal, Viruses, matches both criteria. The list of journals used in this analysis, including their number of articles, as well as the journals discarded because no data on submission, acceptance or publication dates was available, is added as supplementary material A. From those journals, we sampled all articles published since the start of the pandemic and matched those to an equal number of articles published in the same journal prior to the pandemic to form a control group. In case the control group had fewer articles, we used this number of articles and only selected the most recent articles after the pandemic. In case less than ten articles were published since the start of the pandemic, we nonetheless sampled ten articles for the control group. For the control group, we sampled articles starting with publications in 2019 (but before Oct 1 st ) and moving backwards, in order to make sure editorial policies most closely resemble those in the pandemic. Table 1 presents the list of journals used, including the number of articles sampled per journal.

For this we used all preprints in de database, and did use a more narrow sampling strategy. Hence, we include all Covid-19 related preprints. In addition, we analysed the number of preprints that also appeared as journal articles, and the average number of days between publication of the preprint and the corresponding journal article. The analysis is based on the linkage of preprints and journal articles in the Dimensions Database (https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/index.html). Figure 2 compares the overall duration of journals' publication process prior to and during the present pandemic. It demonstrates that, on average, journals have drastically increased the speed of their processes for Covid-19 publications: average turnaround times in our journal sample has decreased from 117 to 60 days. Comparing the 95% confidence intervals of both statistics, shows the decrease to be highly substantial and significant. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . Table 1 presents descriptive statistics on the average duration of the publication process for Covid-19 related articles in journals in our sample. It distinguishes between the periods before and during the pandemic and it splits the entire publication process in the Review stage (between submission and acceptance) and Editorial stage (between acceptance and submission). Figure 3 presents a graphical overview of the average decrease in turnaround time in the period during the crisis compared to the period prior to the pandemic. It again distinguishes between the Review and Editorial stages of the publication process. Note that negative numbers in this case indicate an increase in turnaround time. The figure indicates the Review stage shortens for ten out of the fourteen journals in our sample, while nine journals managed to shorten their Editorial stage. Average acceleration is around 50% for both stages, but it goes up to nearly 100% in some journals. To check whether the acceleration of publication processes is specific to Covid-19 related papers, we analysed the turnaround times for non-Covid-19 related articles published since the start of the pandemic. For all journals in our sample, we selected the ten most recently published articles (as of April 16 th , 2020) about non-Covid-19 related content. In particular, these were articles not present in our previous dataset and articles not mentioning Covid-19, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, or Cov-19 in their title, keywords and abstract. For these articles we also analysed the turnaround times of their publication process. Results are presented in figure 4 . The figure indicates that for most journals, articles not related to Covid-19 have very similar turnaround times as articles published before the pandemic. Unpacking the publication process in the Review and Editorial stage, we conclude that, again, non-Covid-19 related articles follow a very similar pattern to articles published before the pandemic. ",

However, this conclusion should be treated with caution, as no data is available on who reviewed the papers. Maybe the same few experts reviewed a lot more than usual; maybe 'relevant expertise' was taken as a relative criterion, with journals using reviewers that usually would not have counted as experts.

Even though the two do not necessarily exclude each other, it seems reasonable that there is a balance, or perhaps even a trade-off, between speed and quality in peer review. Especially concerning the stage of review, legitimate concerns can be raised on whether speeding up the review process might harm the process' ability to filter incorrect or invalid findings. Such research slipping through peer review, might require corrections or retractions in the future. Given the potentially rapid uptake of medical knowledge in policy and clinical contexts, such corrections might come in too late as potential harm might have already been done. Commentators have raised this concern regarding the usage of information in preprints, but it similarly applies to journal articles. In fact, false information spreading through journal articles is arguably more damaging, since it has the appearance of being 'peer reviewed' and hence properly verified. Scholars have repeatedly warned that a substantial share of articles (hastily) published during this crisis, will require future corrections (Marcus & Oransky, 2020) . Formal expressions of concern -on papers used to make policy decisions -have already been issued (Voss, 2020) . Future research should therefore analyse whether shorter review processes during the Covid-19 pandemic have led to an increase in corrections or retractions of published articles.",
