SARS-Cov-2 entry into a cell is dependent upon binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cellular receptor and on cleavage of the spike protein by the host cell proteases such as Cathepsin L and Cathepsin B. CTSL/B are crucial elements of lysosomal pathway and both enzymes are almost exclusively located in the lysosomes.CTSL disruption offers potential for CoVID-19 therapies. The mechanisms of disruption include: decreasing expression of CTSL, direct inhibition of CTSL activity and affecting the conditions of CTSL environment (increase pH in lysosomes).",

One of the top significant results shown to downregulate the expression of the CTSL gene is Amantadine. Amantadine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as a prophylactic agent for influenza and later for Parkinson's disease. It is available as a generic drug.. Amantadine in addition to downregulating CTSL appears to further disrupt lysosomal pathway , hence interfering with the capacity of the virus to replicate. It acts as a lysosomotropic agent altering the CTSL functional environment. We hypothesize that Amantadine could decrease the viral load in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and as such it may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus likely leading to better clinical outcomes. Clinical studies will be needed to examine the therapeutic utility of amantadine in COVID-19 infection.",

ACE2 is a type I membrane protein expressed in lungs, heart, kidneys and intestine and decreased expression of ACE2 is associated with cardiovascular diseases 2 , 5 . The structural basis for this recognition has been recently mapped out and the cryo-EM structure of the full length viral spike protein that targets human ACE2 complex has been reported 2 . The authors show that viral S protein binds ACE2 at least 10 times more tightly, when compared to the spike protein of the previous SARS-CoV strain. The viral spike glycoprotein (S protein) mediates receptor recognition 6 . Recently the 3.5-angstrom-resolution structure of the S protein has been described 6 .

CTSL is widely expressed in many crucial organs (high in lungs, in nerve tibial, adipose, artery, whole blood and several others). Looking at eQTL variants in CTSL, we have found a very significant and lung specific (rs2378757) variant conferring highly variable expression. The genotype (supp fig) confers lower baseline expression and is likely associated with a better response and conversely higher expression perhaps higher viral load. We observe presence of series of splice QTLs hence variants affecting splicing ratios of transcripts such as rs114063116 significant and present in the lungs tissues. CTSL GTEx analysis points to potential protection or susceptibility of certain individuals. Interestingly the alternative splicing of the CTSL transcript in the lung further displays tissue specific regulatory programs (S.Fig1). A recent functional study points to a common variant in CTSL in the proximal CTSL1 promoter, (position C-171A), confirmed to alter transcription via alteration of the xenobiotic response element 17 . This and similar other variants likely affect natural diversity in baseline expression hence viral fitness at cell entry of SARS-Cov-2. Additionally, we checked in the gnomAD 18 database the number of rare variants and variation tolerance status of CTSL. The results show that there are on average 167 missense author/funder.

Together with significant eQTLs this indicates large effect of genetic variation on CTSL expression and variation thereof. TMPRSS2 is also widely expressed in multiple tissues including those in the GI system, lung, and kidney. The high expression of CTSL and TRMPSS2 transcripts in a series of organs could explain the viral manifestation in these tissues such as recent studies showing viral presence in stool samples from infected individuals 19 as well as effects of the virus seen across tissues. This is assuming that there is enough ACE2 expression on the tissue for viral S protein to bind and target the cell.",

Another viable option is lysosomal dysfunction .that can interfere in many ways with viral replication because this is where the virus is going to get assembled and get ready for subsequent replication. Given one is able to perturb the lysosomes, their function or microenvironment, you may offer protection from the virus or decrease the severity of the symptoms. Having seen that amantadine does not only down-regulate Cathepsin L, but a number of key lysosomal enzymes, we can now hypothesize that lysosomal dysfunction induced by amantadine administration can be protective from viral entry and replication. Our hypothesis that people with certain lysosomal storage diseases are resistant to one of these viruses. Along these lines there is suggestive evidence for this to be true. NPC1 (Neimman Pick type C, storage, cholesterol transport disorder) offers resistance to Ebola in patient cell lines 20 , 21 . Even more interesting in the attached article, bats show selective sensitivity to Ebola versus Marburg viruses",

Amantadine would be predicted by physical and chemical properties to accumulate in the lysosomes and raise a the pH, likely enough to interfere with cathepsin L function. The gene expression pattern reported in this paper suggests that a more general lysosomal program is down-regulated, likely through a common set of transcription factors. Amantadine could hence be used as a potent agent to decrease viral load if administered early enough in the course of the COVID-19 infection. Accumulation in lysosomes, If effective, could reduce viral load, may decrease intra-host organ spread and decrease associated disease severity and progression.",

The retinal pigment epithelia cell line, ARPE-19/HPV-16, was chosen to establish a database of drug profiles because of its noncancerous, human origin, with a normal karyotype. It can also be easily grown as monolayer in 96-well plates. Cell lines were propagated according to supplier's specifications (ATCC Manassas, VA). Compounds were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) or Vanda Pharmaceuticals (Washington, DC). Cells were aliquoted on 96-well plates (~2\u00d710e5 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h prior to providing fresh media with a drug, or the drug vehicle (water, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, methanol, or phosphate-buffered saline solution). Drugs were diluted 1000 fold in buffered Advanced D-MEM/F-12 culture medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing nonessential amino acids and 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate. In these conditions, no significant changes of pH were expected, which was confirmed by the monitoring of the pH indicator present in the medium. A final 10 \u03bc M drug concentration was chosen because it is believed to fit in the range of physiological relevance 22 ). Microscopic inspection of each well was conducted at the end of the treatment to discard any samples where cells had morphological changes consistent with apoptosis. We also verified that the drug had not precipitated in the culture medium.",

Gene expression for 22,238 probe sets of 12,490 genes was generated with U133A2.0 microarrays following the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Drugs were profiled in duplicate or triplicate, with multiple vehicle controls on each plate. A total of 708 microarrays were analyzed including 74 for the 18 antipsychotics, 499 for the other 448 compounds, and 135 for vehicle controls. The raw scan data were first converted to average difference values using MAS 5.0 (Affymetrix). The average difference values of both treatment and control data were set to a minimum threshold of 50 if below 50. For each treatment instance, all probe sets were then ranked based on their amplitude, or level of expression relative to the vehicle control (or average of controls when more than one was used). Amplitude was defined as the ratio of expression (t\u2212v) / [(t+v) / 2] where t corresponds to treatment instance and v to vehicle instance. Each drug group profile was created using our novel Weighted Influence Model, Rank of Ranks (WIMRR) method which underscores the rank of each probe set across the entire gene expression profile rather than the specific change in expression level. WIMRR takes the average rank of each probe set across all of the members of the group and then reranks the probe sets from smallest average rank to largest average rank. A gene-set enrichment metric based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic. Specifically, for a given set of probes, the KS score gives a measure of how up (positive) or down (negative) the set of probes occurs within the profile of another treatment instance.
