Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium and is propelled into the low pressure vascular beds of the lungs by the right ventricle. Oxygenated pulmonary blood enters the left atrium and then to the left ventricle, which propels blood across the body at systemic vascular pressures. Right and left chambers are separated by the atrial and interventricular septa and unidirectional flow is established by the atrio-ventricular valves (tricuspid and mitral) and ventricular-arterial valves (pulmonary and aortic). The heart contains an intrinsic electrophysiologic system, composed of the sinoatrial node in the right atria where depolarization begins and spreads to the atrioventricular node located at the top of the interventricular septum. This electrical impulse is then rapidly propagated by Purkinje fibers to the apex where contraction begins.",

Bulk RNA-seq analysis is unable to assign gene expression to defined cell subpopulations, light microscopy fails to define features beyond morphology of cell subpopulations and immunostainings are limited to the analysis of few markers at once. Moreover, the large size of cardiomyocytes (length/width:~100/25\u00b5M) limits the unbiased capture of single cells requiring analyses of single nuclei transcriptomics to ensure a comprehensive approach. Here, we present a broad transcriptomic census of multiple regions of the adult human heart. We profiled RNA expression of both single cells and nuclei, capturing them from six distinct cardiac anatomical regions. We also analysed the spatial distribution of selected cell populations using multiplex smFISH imaging with RNAscope probes. Our anatomically defined resolved adult human heart cell census provides a reference framework for studies directed towards understanding the cellular and molecular drivers that enable functional plasticity in response to varying physiological conditions in the normal heart, and will inform the heart's responses to disease.",

To capture the heterogeneity of cardiac cell populations, samples were collected as transmural tissue segments that span the three cardiac layers (epicardium, myocardium and endocardium; Figure 1A ) from 14 normal hearts (seven females, seven males) of North American and British organ donors (ages 40-75 years; Figure 1B and Supplementary Table A1 ). We isolated single cells and single nuclei, as the large sizes of cardiomyocyte (CM) are not captured by the 10X Genomics Chromium platform. Fresh tissues were mechanically and enzymatically processed to dissociate single cells, and subsequently cardiac immune cells were enriched from the cell fraction using CD45+ magnetic selection. Single nuclei were isolated from frozen heart tissues and purified by fluorescent activated cell sorting. The transcriptome of single cells and nuclei were profiled using the 10X Genomics Single Cell Gene Expression Solution ( Figure 1A ). After processing, all data from nuclei, cells and CD45+ enriched cells were batch-aligned using a generative deep variational autoencoder 5 , prior to unsupervised clustering. After processing and quality controls, we obtained a total of 45,870 cells, 78,023 CD45+   enriched cells and 363,213 We found differences in the distribution of cell types across donors, even within the same region, and correlations between different cell types at the same site ( Supplementary Table   A3 ). For example, in LV, AX, SP and RV tissues, the proportions of vCM and FB were negatively correlated ( p -value=2.0e-4), while there was a positive correlation among the proportions of PC, SMC, and NC cells ( p -value<1e-4).

By sequencing single cells and single nuclei from the same sample, we resolved seven populations including arterial, venous and lymphatic EC, and an atrial-enriched population.

Due to their low frequency in tissues, the immune compartment is difficult to resolve using only nuclei. By performing CD45+ enrichment from the same cellular suspensions used for non-myocyte scRNA-Seq and using variational autoencoders, we identified 17 different immune cell populations across the myeloid and lymphoid lineages ( Figure 4A and 4B ). involvement.

Transcriptional analyses of CM nuclei were identified based on high-level expression of genes encoding proteins in the sarcomere ( TTN , MYBPC3, TNNT2 ), and involved in calcium-mediated excitation-contraction processes ( RYR2, PLN , SLC8A1 ). Consistent with their developmental origins, functional differences in electrophysiological, contractile, and secretory processes described in previous tissue RNAseq data analyses 7 , 8 , we observed distinct transcriptional signatures in atrial (aCM) and ventricular (vCM) nuclei ( Figure 1C ).

Expression of these genes is likely to promote tissue integrity under the conditions of high ventricular pressure and strain. Clustering of vCM data identified five subpopulations ( Figure 2A ), with variable proportions in LV, AX, SP and RV, indicative of inter-chamber heterogeneity. vCM1 and vCM2 constituted the majority of CM (~70-80%). Subpopulation vCM1 comprised~60% of vCM across all left ventricular sites, but only 33% of RV ( Figure 2C, Supplementary Table B2 ). Small numbers of these nuclei were also detected in atrial tissues ( Figure 2B,D ). In contrast, vCM2 cells were enriched in RV (42%) compared to 11% in LV. We noted only small differences (<3-fold) in the low level of expression of some genes found in vCM1 and vCM2 ( Supplementary Table B1 ), which indicates shared gene programs between the left (enriched in vCM1) and right (enriched in vCM2) ventricles.

As noted above, aCM3 shared a remarkably similar transcriptional profile with vCM3 including the smooth muscle cell gene CNN1 , which we confirmed by smFISH with RNAscope probes ( Figure 2G, Supplementary Figure B1A ). The transcriptional profiles of aCM2, aCM3 and vCM3 likely indicate their derivation from the second heart field that forms the right heart chambers and associated vascular structures 18 . Small cell numbers comprised aCM4-6. aCM4 cells contained several transcripts ( CKM, NDUFA4, COX4I1, FABP3, HSBP1 ) denoting high metabolic activity, similar to vCM4 ( Figure 2E, F ) and had the highest NPPA expression. aCM5 nuclei contained ventricular transcripts, including MYH7 and MYL2 ( Figure 2F ) , confirming a previous observation 33 .

Vascular cells of the heart The vascular cellular compartment including EC, SMC, PC,analysed alongside mesothelial cells, separated into 15 different cell populations with clear anatomical and arterio-venous specificities ( Figure 3A ). Single cell RNA-seq were particularly useful here, in addition to single nuclei, providing half of the transcriptional data ( Supplementary Table C1 ) and enabling analyses of putative (trans)differentiation relationships using RNA velocity ( Supplementary Figure C1 ). Endothelial cells, defined by pan-EC markers PECAM1 , CDH5 and VWF, were highly heterogeneous, consisting of eight subpopulations ( Figure 3A ). The most abundant subpopulation (53.0% of all EC) was annotated as capillary EC (EC_cap) given the enrichment of RGCC and CA4, marker genes of microvascular endothelium in CCL2 , IL6 and ICAM1 37 , as well as FOS and JUN that can be induced in a variety of situations including cellular stress. Neighbouring clusters contained an arterial endothelial subpopulation (EC_art), as confirmed by specific enrichment of SEMA3G , EFNB2 , DLL4 , and a venous endothelial subpopulation (EC_ven) expressing a well-accepted venous marker NR2F2 38 and ACKR1 ( Figure 3A , Supplementary Figure C2 and Supplementary Table C2 ). ACKR1 was reported to also be expressed in endothelial stalk cells in cancer 39 , EC expanding in cirrhosis 40 and the endothelium of lymphnodes' post-capillary venules 41 . Using a combination of pan-EC ( CDH5) , arterial EC ( SEMA3G ), and smooth muscle cells ( MYH11) markers, we found ACKR1 expression in the EC of small caliber veins (as defined by a CDH5+ SEMA3G-EC with thin SMC layer) ( Figure 3B ). Of note, one EC cluster enriched for atrial-derived cells (EC_atrial) and specifically expresses at least two genes previously used as endocardial markers: SMOC1 , a newly proposed endocardial marker 42 whose product regulates angiogenesis 43 ; NPR3, enriched in mouse endocardium as shown in fate-mapping studies 44 .

These analyses recapitulated the FB subpopulations described above, including FB4_profibrotic cells in each chamber that express OSMR and IL6ST , and also identified another ECM-producing FB that did not emerge from the integrated analysis of all chambers. These aFB2 and vFB2 populations differed in their expression of collagen isoforms and other ECM proteins ( Supplementary Figure D1H, Supplementary Table D3-4 ). Similarly, we identified chamber-specific aFB4 and vFB3 that differed in the expression of proteins involved in organising connective tissue.",

Two of the predicted yolk sac derived ( CCR2-), resident macrophages, M\u00d8M2_trFOLR2+ and M\u00d8_trTMSB4X+, with similar transcriptional profiles, expressed TMSB4X , FOLR2 , S100A9 , HLA-DRB1 , HLA-DRA and LYVE1 , which partially resemble resident myeloid cells described in mice and implicated in cardiac remodelling 62 ; however, unlike the murine model, the human cells did not express TIMD4 ( Supplementary Figure E 1A and Supplementary Table E1 ). M\u00d8M2_trFOLR2+, dendritic cells (DC_class1) and M\u00d8_trTMSB4X+ expressed the anti-inflammatory genes GRN , HIF1A , AIF1 and TIMP1 63 ( Supplementary Figure E1C ), suggesting that these populations could be associated with cardiac homeostasis 64 . The cardiac-resident lymphoid compartment was composed of nine subpopulations ( Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure E1B ), with the largest being NK cells, followed by short-lived effector CD8 + T-cells (CD8+T_slec), activated CD4+ T-cells (CD4+T_eff) and effector memory Th2 CD4+ T-cells ( Supplementary Table E2) . NK, NKT, effector CD8+ T-cells (CD8+T_eff), CD4+T_eff and CD8+T_slec transcriptomes were enriched for genes encoding pro-inflammatory chemokines ( CCL3 , CCL4 , CCL5), IL2RG , and LCK, encoding a T-cell antigen receptor-linked signal transduction protein whose activation yields lymphokine production 65 .To evaluate cell -cell interactions of the immune cells in cardiac homeostasis and remodelling we used cellphonedb66 . Thus we predicted putative cross-talk among myeloid and lymphoid cells, CM, and FB (Figure 4CandSupplementary Table E3 )64 .

Association of GWAS hits with cardiac cell types Using summary statistics of 12 well-powered GWAS studies of cardiac traits ( Supplementary Table H ) we applied the GWAS gene set enrichment method MAGMA 82,83 to identify the most relevant cardiac cells for each trait, while removing redundant associations in conditional analyses. We found that atrial fibrillation (AF) GWAS signals were associated with gene expression profiles in vCM3, largely due to higher mean expression of CAV1, CAV2, PRRX1 and other AF-associated genes in vCM3 cells. PR interval GWAS signals were associated with aCM population aCM5, with high expression SCN5A, CAV1 , ARHGAP24 , MEIS1 , TBX5 and TTN . GWAS signals for the QRS duration were associated with specific gene expression in NC1 ( PRKCA, CEP85L, SLC35F1, SIPA1L1, KLF12, FADS2 ). Coronary artery disease (CAD) GWAS signals were associated with gene expression in a wide range of cell types (in particular SMC, FB, and EC). Similar results were also found for hypertension, in line with the disease relevance of vascular cells for both traits ( Supplementary Figure H ). Discussion :Our analyses of about half a million single cardiac cells and nuclei in six distinct cardiac regions from 14 donors significantly expand the characterisation of the heart's cellular landscape, and contribute to a reference adult human heart cell atlas.

CM were the most prevalent cardiac cells and comprised higher percentages in ventricles than atria, as well as in left ventricular tissues from women versus men. As expected, aCM and vCM shared gene programs involved in excitation-contraction coupling, but also exhibit transcriptional differences indicative of the different developmental origins of these chambers from two primordial heart fields, and the vastly distinctive hemodynamic forces within adult atria and ventricles. We identified five different vCM subpopulations and six different aCM subpopulations, with variable proportions in the left and right chambers, and gene profiles of suggestive of canonical as well as specialized functions.",
