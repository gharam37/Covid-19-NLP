While most patients experience only mild symptoms, a relevant proportion develop severe disease progression with increasing hypoxia up to acute respiratory distress syndrome. About 5% of patients require intensive care treatment including mechanical ventilation.

These values predicted respiratory failure with high accuracy (figure 1B/C, p=1.7\u00b710 -8 , AUC=0.98). The statistically optimal cutoff for IL-6 was 80pg/ml, identifying all but one patient with respiratory failure correctly, and misclassifying only one patient that still does not require intubation. The risk of respiratory failure for patients with IL-6 levels of \u226580pg/ml was 92% and thus 22 times higher compared to patients with lower IL-6 levels. After reaching an IL-6 value of 80pg/ml, the median time to mechanical ventilation was 1.5 days (range 0-4 days).",

Further studies and larger sample sizes will be needed to validate our findings and possibly determine a more accurate cutoff. To date, it is unclear whether IL-6 merely represents a biomarker or a central pathogenetic element of severe COVID-19 that should be used as a parameter for therapeutic intervention.",
