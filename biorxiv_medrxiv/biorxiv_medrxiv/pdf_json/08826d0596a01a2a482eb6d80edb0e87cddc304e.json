In particular, serious problems are arising in the most affected countries due to the shortage of ICU beds and the large number of deaths that the authorities are unable to deal with. National health authorities do not have adequate prediction mechanisms to facilitate clinical crisis management. We have performed bibliographic searches of the usual terms used to designate COVID-19, together with those of \"prediction\", \"estimation\", \"ICU\", \"mortality\" and the like, both in Pubmed and in Google Scholar. The predictive literature related to COVID-19 remains very sparse and the few models that do exist are based on exponential adjustments for forecasting the population affected. However, these models lose their predictive accuracy when the growth rate of infections decreases, added to which such models fail to determine the most statistically efficient maximum prediction time.",

In addition, it is applicable to any type of health needs, provided we have data on their consumption. It can be applied to anticipate the needs of health staff, hospital beds, medicine, equipment ..., and can also be applied to anticipate other clinical situations apart from deaths. The method does, nevertheless, evidence certain shortcomings that must be taken into account and that basically affect the available data. The method only uses one independent variable, namely those officially declared as being infected, and which thus relies on the possibility of actually applying detection tests. It also depends on health authorities being truthful in their information policy. In Spain, few detection tests were carried out in the early stages of the outbreak, such that patients displaying mild symptoms were not tested. Large-scale testing of mild cases began around 20/03/2020 (https://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/pontevedra/2020/03/20/test-rapidos-salir-cocheinician-hoy-cita-previa/0003_202003P20C1992.htm), although not throughout the whole country. Obviously, if the number of tests for possible COVID-19 infected cases were to be increased, the model would tend to overestimate ICUs and deaths and would need to be recalibrated. In other words, any significant change in the number of tests would affect our independent variable, the number of those declared as being infected, and would have consequences for the predictive performance of both independent variables.",

The number of patients in the UCIs represents the actual number of patients there, but not the number of patients who are in need of intensive care. If ICUs are swamped, medical staff will be forced to ethically screen critical patients 10 , such that data will cease to be representative of clinical needs and will become representative of the limited resources available. If we consider that this need to screen will increase the more the pandemic spreads and the greater the number of patients in need of ICU care, the model may be underestimating ICU needs as infection expands. Moreover, any improvement in clinical pharmacological treatment using antivirals in the pre-ICU admission stage will entail an overestimation of needs.",

When 800 patients die every day, at a rate of 33 deaths per hour, reporting the number of deaths inaccurately can lead to fundamental errors in the estimates. The health authorities must establish a specific time to report the numbers and must keep this stable, added to which health centres must prepare the counts accurately and ensure that they reflect the established time periods. In Spain, it was decided to close the daily count at 9.00 pm, and this is a time which must remain fixed until the pandemic is over.

The first alternative would enable us to replace the variables or to correct them prior to performing estimations.
