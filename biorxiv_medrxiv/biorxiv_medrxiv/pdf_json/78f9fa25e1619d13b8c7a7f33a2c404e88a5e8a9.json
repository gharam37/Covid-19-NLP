Although angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the reported receptor of SARS-CoV-2, information about SARS-CoV-2 invading airway epithelial cells is very limited. Based on the analysis of the Human Protein Atlas database, we compared the virus-related receptors of epithelial-derived cells from different organs and found potential key molecules in the local microenvironment for SARS-CoV-2 entering airway epithelial cells. In addition, we found that these proteins were associated with virus reactive proteins in host airway epithelial cells, which may promote the activation of the immune system and the release of inflammatory factors. Our findings provide a new research direction for understanding the potential microenvironment required by SARS-CoV-2 infection in airway epithelial, which may assist in the discovery of potential drug targets against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

However, the pathogenesis of this novel pathogen and any potential drug targets remain to be elucidated. The clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 resembles those of SARS-CoV [2] , and the genome of SARS-CoV-2 represents good homology with SARS-CoV [3] , with 79.5% sequence consistency the two coronaviruses [4] .",

            "text": "SARS-CoV mainly replicates in the lower respiratory tract, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage [5] . The tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 also is the lower respiratory tract [6, 7] . In addition, it was reported that cytopathic effects were observed 96 h after inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 on the surface layers of human airway epithelial cells (EpCs), and a lack of cilium beating was observed after virus infection [8] . However, it was found that Huh7 epithelial-like cells from the liver that are similar to airway EpCs produced no specific cytopathic effects after six days of virus infection [8] . In addition, a recent study has shown that an epithelial cell line from cervical cancer (HeLa) was also insensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection [4] . These studies suggest that cells from different epithelial sources have different SARS-CoV when entering cells [11] . To date, more studies have confirmed that ACE2 is also the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 infection [4] ; however, ACE2 displays high expression in the kidney, bile duct, and testis with low expression in the airways and lungs [12] [13] [14] . Lindskog, et al also emphasized that the expression of ACE2 in human respiratory system is limited, and questioned the role of ACE2 for infection in human lungs [15] . Therefore, we wonder whether there are some key local microenvironment proteins specifically expressed on the surface of airway EpC that makes the virus prefer airway EpCs. In some cases, additional cell surface molecules or co-receptors are required for sufficient viral entry into host cells. It remains unclear whether these local environments with specific components are related to the susceptibility of different cell types to SARS-CoV-2.",

Epithelia are equipped with TLR surface receptors, which recognize conserved molecular patterns associated with pathogens or tissue damage. TLR signals activate NF-\u03baB through the adaptor protein MyD88 [28] . We found that the most enriched signaling pathways in the interaction network between airway EpC receptors and host-reactive protein are the TLR signaling pathway followed by the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway ( Figure 2B ). In addition, we found putative activation of the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, which begins a downstream signal pathway to secrete type I interferon in the interaction network. Many proteins related to the production and regulation of type I interferon were also observed in the interaction network ( Figure S5 ). The most enriched item was IL-1\u03b2, which is consistent with the fact that the serum of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has a higher pro-inflammatory factor IL-1\u03b2 than that of uninfected people [7] .",

In addition, several highly expressed proteins were found not only expressed in airway EpCs, but also in the epithelial-derived cells of other organs. For example, apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3A (APOBEC3A) was highly expressed in the colon (glandular cells); transmembrane protein 173 (TMEM173), AP2A2, and ring finger protein 26 (RNF26) were highly expressed in the esophagus (squamous EpCs); RNF26 in the oral mucosa (squamous EpCs); and ribonuclease L (RNASEL) in the tonsil (squamous EpCs). These results indicate that although the responses of different organs to the virus were identical, specific response proteins to the virus vary between different types of EpCs. In particular, highly expressed response proteins on airway EpCs may play a positive role in regulating the propagation and transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",

The network controlled several biological processes including virus receptor activity, defense response to virus, viral modulation of host morphology or physiology, detection of virus, evasion or tolerance of host defenses by the virus, viral suppression of host apoptotic process, and viral regulation of viral protein levels in the host cell (Figure 2A). Each protein in the interaction network may, together with the receptor of airway EpCs, be involved in the biological process of host cells after virus infection. For example, Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) box polypeptide 58 (DDX58, also known as retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein, RIG-I), which had the largest number of interacting proteins, acted as a cytoplasmic sensor of viral nucleic acids and played a major role in sensing viral infection and in the activation of a cascade of antiviral responses including the induction of type I interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Interferon induced with helicase C domain 1 (IFIH1), an important paralog gene of DDX58, was involved in the alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. DDX58 and IFIH1were both putative RNA helicases.In the interaction network, we focused on the protein interaction of virus microenvironment components with high expression in airway EpCs, which probably perform a specific function in airway EpCs after virus infection. RNASEL, the interacting protein of XPR1, matched these parameters and was specifically highly expressed in airway and tonsil squamous EpCs(Figure 2A). RNASEL probably mediates its antiviral effects through a combination of direct cleavage of single-stranded viral RNAs, inhibition of protein synthesis through the degradation of rRNA, induction of apoptosis, and induction of other antiviral genes. Another receptor protein, DAG1, which was seldom expressed in airway EpCs, interacted with interleukin (IL)-33(Figure 2A). IL-33 binds to and signals through the IL-1",

For example, SARS-CoV-2 might be involved in immune pathways through the interaction network between virus microenvironment components and virus-reactive proteins in airway EpCs, which may be related to the cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 pneumonia patients. These results provide a preliminary research direction for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in airway EpCs. In addition, our study identified that some virus microenvironment components are not only highly expressed in airway epithelium but are also specifically expressed in other organs, suggesting that more organs may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 such as the intestine and kidney.
