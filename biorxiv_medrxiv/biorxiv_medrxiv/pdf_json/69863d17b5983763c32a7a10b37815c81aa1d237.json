It consists of seven domains, for each, we will grade as \"Low risk\", \"Moderate risk\", \"Serious risk\", \"Critical risk\", and \"No information\". For case-control and cohort studies, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale will be used (19, 20) . It consists of eight domains, for each, we will grade with stars. The more stars, the lower the risk of bias. For cross-sectional studies, we use a methodology evaluation tool recommended by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (21). This tool assesses the quality of bias according to 11 criteria. And each criterion is answered by \"Yes\", \"No\" or \"unsure\". For case reports and case series, we used a methodology evaluation tool recommended by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (22). The risk of bias is evaluated according to eight criteria. The results were summarized by scoring method, for the \"Yes\" items, the score was 1, and for the \"no\" items, the score was 0.

The articles included 25 case reports, 23 case series and one cohort study. The studies included a total of 1667 patients: 955 males and 712 females. Eighteen percent of children were aged less than one year. Most of the studies were carried out in China, including 17 studies from Hubei (Table 1). One study was from Singapore, one from Korea, one from Vietnam and one from Iran. The results on risk of bias are reported in Supplementary Material 2, and quality of the evidence in Supplementary Material 3. All of the included studies reported the symptoms of children with COVID-19. The results showed that 83% [95% CI: 78%, 88%] of the cases had likely acquired the infection from their family members with COVID-19. 94% [95% CI: 90%, 98%] of children were mild cases and 3% [95% CI: 2%, 4%] were severe case. Among the children with severe symptoms that reported symptom clearly, 9 children have comorbidity, 10 children have gastrointestinal symptoms and 4 children have concurrent infection. Only two children were dead that has been reported in our included studies.(47, 66) The main symptoms were fever (48% [95% CI: 39%, 56%]), cough (39% [95% CI: 30%, 48%]). Thirty percent [95% CI: 18%, 42%] of children had both cough and fever. 7% [95% CI: 5%, 9%] and 6% [95% CI: 4%, 9%] of cases had diarrhea and nausea/vomiting. The proportion of children with more than one symptom was 35% [95% CI: 21%, 48%], and 19% [95% CI: 14%, 23%] of all children were asymptomatic. Forty-two studies reported the imaging features of children with COVID-19, including 19 case series and 23 case reports. 66% [95% CI: 55%, 77%] had abnormal imaging. 35% [95% CI: 26%, 44%] of children had ground-glass opacity.",

The mean lymphocyte count in children was 2.84\u00d710 \u2079/L [95% CI: 2.55, 3.13]. Lymphocyte count was elevated in 41% [95%CI: 2%, 80%] and below normal in 15% [95% CI: 8%, 22%] of children. Eighteen case series reported the results of blood biochemistry tests. The mean value of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 20.46 U/L [95% CI: 14.51, 26.41], and 11% [95% CI: 8%, 14%] of cases had elevated ALT values. The mean value of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 32.04 U/L [95% CI: 30.25, 33.83], and 15% [95% CI: 9%, 21%] of cases had elevated AST values. The mean value of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) was 5.05 mg/L [95% CI: 1.86, 8.24], and CRP was elevated in 22% [95% CI: 15%, 28%] of the children.
