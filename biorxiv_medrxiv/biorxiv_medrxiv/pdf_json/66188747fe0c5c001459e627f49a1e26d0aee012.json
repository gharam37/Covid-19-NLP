            "text": "The surfaces of proteins are generally hydrophilic but there have been reports of sites that exhibit an exceptionally high affinity for individual water molecules. Not only do such molecules often fulfil critical biological functions, but also, they may alter the binding of newly designed drugs. In crystal structures, sites consistently occupied in each unit cell yield electron density clouds that represent water molecule presence. These are recorded in virtually all high-resolution structures obtained through X-ray diffraction. In this work, we utilized the wealth of data from the RCSB Protein Data Bank to train a residual deep learning model named 'hotWater' to identify sites on the surface of proteins that are most likely to bind water, the so-called water hot spots. The model can be used to score existing water molecules from a PDB file to provide their ranking according to the predicted binding strength or to scan the surface of a protein to determine the most likely water hot-spots de novo. This is computationally much more efficient than currently used molecular dynamics simulations. Based on testing the model on three example proteins, which have been resolved using both highresolution X-ray crystallography (providing accurate positions of trapped waters) as well as low-resolution X-ray diffraction, NMR or CryoEM (where structure refinement does not yield water positions), we were able to show that the hotWater method is able to recover in the \"water-free\" structures many water binding sites known from the highresolution structures. A blind test on a newly solved protein structure with waters removed from the PDB also showed good prediction of the crystal water positions. This was compared to two known algorithms that use electron density and was shown to have higher recall at resolutions >2.6 \u00c5. We also show that the algorithm can be applied to novel proteins such as the RNA polymerase complex from SARS-CoV-2, which could be of use in drug discovery. The hotWater model is freely available at (https://pypi.org/project/hotWater/).",

Each positive and negative class sample was annotated with vectors pointing towards all proximal (<=7.5\u00c5) atoms of the protein.

One way of mitigating the problem is training-data augmentation including random rotations of the each input feature sample [34] or data-preprocessing to ensure rotational invariance of the inputs. In this work, we opted for the latter solution; the vectors were rotated to a common system of coordinates in Euclidean space by Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization using the vector pointing to the closest atom of the protein ( ) and the orthogonal part of the vector at the highest angle against it ( ) as the first and second basis vectors for the orientation (the third vector forming the new orthonormal basis is their cross product):",

The training set was split into six cross-validation folds (excluding the holdout test set) and various network depths (numbers of hidden layers and numbers of residual blocks, see below), as well as combinations of hyper-parameters, were evaluated to establish the choice that yields the highest classification accuracy on the validation set (corresponding to the lowest loss, measured in terms of binary crossentropy). The best performing network found has the following architecture: the two input layers (positional vectors and atom-types/B-values) are separately passed through a 1D convolution of thirty filters with linear activation functions (window size was set to 4) and subsequently concatenated to mix atom type and B-value-based patterns with the patterns learnt from the array of input vectors describing the ordered positional vectors; the data is then duplicated and passed into two collateral paths, the first one being a series of two residual blocks, each containing a series of two batch normalization layers with rectified linear unit activation functions followed by 1D convolutional layers, and the second being skip connections that join each residual block after passing its respective output data through a 1D convolutional layer. The paths are then joined together in a final residual block followed by a 1D convolution with a single sigmoid activation kernel and, lastly, the dimensionality of the model is collapsed in the final max pooling layer serving as the output for predicting whether or not a position is likely to correspond to a water molecule \"hot-spot\".

The initial phases were obtained using molecular replacement carried out using Phaser [57] , with T. brucei PEX-14 as the search model. Manual rebuilding using electron density maps was carried out in Coot [58] . Phenix Elbow [59] was used for obtaining restraints for small molecules in the crystallization conditions. Further refinements were carried out using Phenix Refine. 5 % of the reflections were used for cross-validation analysis. The final model will be deposited in the PDB; PDB code to be confirmed..

The accuracy is expected to be highly sensitive to the number of \"trivial\" non-interacting sites the model was presented with during training. Likewise, filtering out the positive dataset to exclude water molecules for which there is insufficient evidence in the form of electron density clouds could further improve the classification accuracy. We have not performed this step since Nittinger et al. have shown that roughly 90% of water molecules encoded on the surfaces of proteins within PDB files were real [14] . While this fraction is already high, we have further increased it by excluding all water molecules not featuring interactions with at least two atoms of the protein structure (this was generally between 0-15% of water molecules encoded in each PDB file) or further away than 4.5\u00c5 of any atom of the protein.

Unsurprisingly, we found that the high-scoring water hot-spots are buried within the protein's surface (figure 4C) and surrounded densely by atoms of the protein (figure 4B); this increases the likelihood of creating multiple hydrogen bonds precisely at the configuration, which confers the most stable interaction. The normalized temperature factors also show a clear anti-correlation with prediction scores ( figure  4D) , however, based on the breadth of the distributions, this is not a major factor affecting the predictions. Interestingly, the highest scoring water hot-spots feature precisely the same distance to closest atoms as the average water molecule used in the training set (2.8\u00c5; figure 4A ).

X-ray crystal structures are affected by many additional parameters, such as crystal packing, pH, temperature, and the presence of ions or other additives that may affect the presence of water molecules in the system. The presence of such additional molecules and molecular ions is currently not an input into our computational process, which analyzes the protein molecules present in a single unit cell of a solved structure; thus, the system could predict a water molecule in place of an ion or crystal contact, leading to a deviation from the expected results. The same is true for NMR structures, which are measured in aqueous solution; the conditions are very different to those in silico as well as to those in high-resolution Xray structures, as used for the training set, due to different environments and higher intrinsic flexibility in solution. The flexibility seen in solution, along with the variety of conformations measurable in both NMR and Cryo-EM are not represented in the training set, which prevents the machine learning model from \"seeing\" and learning from alternative biologically relevant protein conformations. This inherent bias in protein conformations attributed to crystal structures is also likely to contribute to the disagreements between computational predictions obtained for non-crystallized proteins and the water positions identified in X-ray-based structures.",

In crystallography, the structure of a unit cell is calculated within the electron density map, which is then iteratively used in the refinement calculations and further manually refined to repeatedly improve the structure. The unit cell motif repeats periodically throughout the crystal lattice, with the edge of one unit cell touching the edge of the next unit cell in a tessellating pattern. When only one unit cell is inspected, the molecules at the edge of the neighboring unit cell are therefore disregarded. In Figure 6 D-F, three cases of this are shown pictorially. The unit cell water molecules provided are shown in bright red, whilst those of the neighboring unit cell are shown in a deeper purple. All three cases show purported false positives; that is, a water molecule is predicted but none is seen in the PDB of the unit cell. However, when we manually inspect the crystal structure, so that neighboring unit cells' electron densities can also be inspected carefully, we see that in the cases of D and E, there is indeed a water molecule where the model predicted. In F, there is instead an alternative molecule seen in the unit cell, the aromatic group of a tryptophan sidechain that would clash with the predicted water. This means that whilst it is possible that a water could sit there, it would never be seen in the crystal structure due to the crystal packing. As 'false false positives' like these ( Figure 6 C-F) are included in the calculation of the statistics as false positives, the model's apparent statistics indicate a higher false positive rate than is truly the case. author/funder.

We input the backbone manual refinement with no waters present into the deep learning algorithm and used the output in a refinement calculation using Phenix. This gave an Rfree value (used to measure the fit of a model to the electron density, where a lower Rfree value represents a better fit) of 0.2318. In comparison, a manual refinement before the addition of waters had an Rfree of 0.2416, larger by around 1 %. This is at a resolution of 1.6 \u00c5. We then compared the algorithm with the Coot Find Waters tool and the Phenix Update Waters option in the refinement process at a variety of resolution cut-offs (Figure 7) . It was found that at cut-offs at lower resolution (>2.6\u00c5), no waters were found using Phenix and a maximum of 6 water molecules using Coot. The HotWater algorithm has a recall of 0.27 at all resolutions where the protein structure can be fitted as it relies purely on the PDB. This recall is only matched by Phenix at a resolution of 2.5\u00c5 and was not matched by the Coot Find Waters (with default settings) at any resolutions tested. The precision of the hotWater algorithm is, however, lower than that for the two algorithms that use electron density. This is of course understandable given that electron density is fixed evidence, whilst our algorithm is extrapolating from other datasets. It is conceivable however, that with implementation of electron density data into the training set, our algorithm would have reduced false positives due to the unit cell boundary and have even better recall and precision statistics. This would be a valid approach for further improvement of the software for the crystallography community.

The hotWater algorithm is not affected by resolution of the electron density map, provided that the protein backbone can be fitted and, as such, is shown as a dashed blue line.",

This means that they are so fundamental in terms of energetic considerations that drug discovery attempts would be ill-advised to consider displacing them. They are often found in or at the edge of active site regions and, instead of being displaced, are normally considered by drug discovery teams as part of the protein surface, meaning that ligands are designed to maintain the position of that water and maximize interactions with it. Our algorithm allows the ranking of water molecules considering the strength and types of interactions, based on how consistently similar sites are occupied by water molecules in the training set. By using a particularly high or narrow threshold, only the most dominant waters would be highlighted, allowing scientists to analyze the presence of potential 'water hot-spots' within their structures. Currently the standard way to determine their presence is to solve several crystal structures, thus highlighting their repeated presence, or by synthesizing molecule that should extend into the area of the water to displace it and finding a reduced activity, despite a significant increase being expected. This is costly in both time and financial terms and a computational solution to this would be of great benefit to the drug discovery community.",

In comparisons with both of the recently solved structures, this was seen. In the tcPEX14 structure, a water was placed in the position of the oxygen atom of glycerol, whilst in the IMP-13 structure (PDB: 6RZR [61] ), waters were predicted in the locations of the oxygen atoms of the substrate. Based on this, studying the predicted water positions in and near interesting binding sites could really enrich the information possessed by structural biologists and aid in design of molecules that maximize the interactions of the predicted water molecules.",

Current in silico fragment-based screening relies solely on computationally demanding, whilst still inaccurate physical force field models [63] . We have developed a machine-learning model for determining the water hot spots on a protein's surface, that has been shown to work on previously published and new structures. This will help to determine water hotspots that are often critical to structure-based drug development. We envisage that our approach can also be extended to other small molecules and provide a novel deep learning tool for in silico screening and drug design. Our model can also serve to quickly, ab-initio solvate crystal structures during refinement even before the electron density is searched for water densities.

These are therefore 'false false positives'. F) a water is predicted using the algorithm, but in the neighboring unit cell, there is instead the tryptophan present, preventing the presence of a water.
