            "text": "The ongoing COVID-19 epidemics poses a particular challenge to low and middle income countries, making some of them consider the strategy of \"vertical confinement\". In this strategy, contact is reduced only to specific groups (like age groups) that are at increased risk of severe disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aim to assess the feasibility of this scenario as an exit strategy for the current lockdown in terms of its ability to keep the number of cases under the health care system capacity. We developed a modified SEIR model, including confinement, asymptomatic transmission, quarantine and hospitalization. The population is subdivided into 9 age groups, resulting in a system of 72 coupled nonlinear differential equations. The rate of transmission is dynamic and derived from the observed delayed fatality rate; the parameters of the epidemics are derived with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We used Brazil as an example of middle income country, but the results are easily generalizable to other countries considering a similar strategy. We find that starting from 60% horizontal confinement, an exit strategy on May 1st of confinement of individuals older than 60 years old and full release of the younger population results in 400 000 hospitalizations, 50 000 ICU cases, and 120 000 deaths in the 50-60 years old age group alone. The health care system avoids collapse if the 50-60 years old are also confined, but our model assumes an idealized lockdown where the confined are perfectly insulated from contamination, so our numbers are a conservative lower bound. Our results discourage confinement by age as an exit strategy.",

Since it was first reported in Dec 2019 in China [2], the virus rapidly made its way to other parts of the world taking pandemic proportions [3] . The number of cases and deaths exponentially increased reaching a total of 1.5 million confirmed cases and 88 thousand deaths in early April 2020. Recent disease outbreaks that spilled over from animals such as Ebola [4, 5] or avian influenza [6] have been described as specific to developing countries. COVID-19 has been breaking this myth as the virus has been particularly exceptional at breaching in inside developed countries and challenging their health system. In Europe, Italy has been particularly affected. With 140 thousand cases, the Italian national health system has been struggling to effectively respond to the exponentially increasing flow of patients in need of intensive care [7] . The United States recently surpassed China in total number of cases (420 thousand), becoming a particular hot bed in this phase of the pandemics [8] . By the time this article is published, there will likely not be a place on Earth where the virus did not cause any damage. West African countries such as Sierra Leone just reported their first cases [9] and catastrophic scenario similar to the 2016 Ebola outbreak is possible.",

SIR-type models, also known as Kermack-McKendrick model [15] , consists of a set of differential equations and has been applied to a variety of infectious diseases.

The epidemic is starting at March 1st and the number of symptomatic is predicted to end at July 1st. The peak of symptomatics is predicted for May 17th with 20 million symptomatics.

ICU beds will reach saturation on May 3rd, when the \u2248 35 thousand ICU beds in Brazil are occupied (since the estimate assumes that all ICU beds should be occupied with coronavirus patients, which is not realistic, the collapse should in fact happen sooner).

Confinement was implemented at time t = 0 corresponding to March 22 when the first measurement of social distancing was implemented. To not overwhelm the health care system capacity (\u2248 4 \u00d7 10 4 ) ICU beds, the level of social distancing should be over 70%. As mentioned in the introduction, estimates are that Brazil is maintaining 56% (with state-by-state variation from a maximum of 64.7% to a minimum of 53.7%). At this low level of distancing, capacity should be reached in less than 50 days, which is in agreement with the dynamical R(t) model in Fig. 4 .",

As seen in the cyan line, the number of hospitalized rises from 30 to 60 years old and falls for 70 years old onwards. That is because even though 70+ are more likely to be hospitalized, the number of 30-60 is much higher in the population. Fig. 8 shows the same results for the fraction of hospitalized that needs ICU. Fig. 9 shows results from the same suite of models but for the number of fatalities. For the number of ICU cases, there is no significant difference past age 60, with only a minor uptick at the 70-80 age range. Collapse of the health care system can be avoided if vertical confinement is instored on people who are 60 or older, but at the expense of a significant number of extra ICU cases for the 50-60 age bin. At 60% confinement, hundreds of thousands of deaths are seen in the 60-70, 70-80, and 80+ age bins. The number drops to 50 000 in the 90% confinement. As noted before, vertical confinement for 60 years old and older leads to a significant number of deaths for the 50-60 age bin (over 50 000). Vertical confinement at 50 years old leads to a much lower death rate for this age segment.",

In Fig. 10 we model a release from lockdown on May 1st, according to two scenarios: full release for the population under 50 (dashed line) and full release for the population under 60 (solid line). The population past this age is kept at 90% confinement. The upper plots show the susceptible (S) and confined compartments (C), normalized by the number of individuals in the respective age bin. The second row from top to bottom shows the number of hospitalizations, the third row the number of ICU cases, and the last row the cumulative number of fatalities. As the population is released from the general confinement, the number of H/U /D peaks at 400 000/50 000/120 000 in the 50-60 age bin alone, that bears the lion's share of morbidity. Keeping the 50-60 age population in 90% confinement lowers the statistics significantly, with the health care system at capacity, and the number of deaths per age bin about 25 000, with 60+ years olds having the same fatalities as the 40-50 age group.",

Since the identification of the first case, the response strategy in Brazil has been changing over time. At first, only international travelers admitted to hospitals had access to SARS-CoV-2 testing. Now there are diagnostic clinics and universities involved in COVID-19 testing, but there is no national massive testing strategy in place. Besides, each Brazilian state has the authority to put in place their own strategy to address the epidemic. The states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, containing the largest metropoles in the country, adopted larger strategies of isolation with schools and stores closed early on while similar strategies had not yet been adopted in other states. Bottom line, the resulting morbidity and mortality rates can change significantly, resulting in dramatically different output numbers as the number of infected people or the number of hospital beds needed. It is necessary to have massive testing strategy in place to have better prediction accuracy of the models.",

A decrease in the rate of confirmed cases is seen with respect to the rate of fatalities, which is indicative of the effect of the lockdown. A 60% lockdown reduces the number of deaths to 400 000 due to COVID-19, still not avoiding overload of the health care system. An increase in lockdown to 70% is needed to avoid the number of cases from overcoming the number of available critical care beds.",

The ICU cases in this age range alone would bring the health care system to collapse and result in over 100 000 deaths. Confinement by age group should consider the population over 50 years old as well. However, the age range 50-60 is also a part of the workforce, and thus defeats the purpose of a confinement by age. Moreover, we emphasize that our model assumes an idealized lockdown where the confined are perfectly insulated from contamination, while in reality there would be several practical barriers to it as the confined elderly would depend on the young for most essential activities, and a perfect lockdown would not be achieved in a multi-generational household, especially in close quarters such as those found in the low and even middle income neighborhoods common in Brazil. Our results therefore discourage confinement by age as the only exit strategy. We urge Brazilian authorities to take action to prevent virus dissemination in the critical coming weeks.",
