However, because our body can take various 29 postures, the stimulus location in space -often referred to as its external location 30 -must be derived by combining skin location and body posture, a process termed 31 tactile remapping (Heed, Buchholz, et al., 2015) . Indeed, there is evidence that 32 external tactile locations can be coded in a gaze-centered reference frame ( For touch, it has been suggested that the construction of spatial location is 49 an automatic process, implying that any tactile input is remapped into an external 50 code, irrespective of its relevance (Heed & Aza\u00f1\u00f3n, 2014; R\u00f6der et al., 2004) .

This is surprising because the TOJ task asks about the identity of the 74 touched limb, and, in theory, it would be irrelevant to this question where the hand 75 was in space. That limb crossing, nevertheless, affects TOJ implies that posture 76 cannot be strategically ignored, but is automatically incorporated into the hand 77 assignment. 78",

First, it has been suggested that touch location, once it is 80 remapped, is retained only in an external spatial code, and the original skin location 81 is discarded in the process. To report which body part has been touched, the brain 82 must then reversely determine which limb was located at the computed external 83 location at the time of the touch (Kitazawa, 2002; Kitazawa et al., 2008; Yamamoto 84 & Kitazawa, 2001) . We refer to this suggestion as the space-to-limb reconstruction 85 hypothesis. When applied to errors in the TOJ task, this hypothesis implies that 86 participants correctly remap the two tactile stimuli into external space, but then 87 reconstruct erroneously which hand was at the first spatial location. 88",

When the limbs are crossed, skin-based 90 and external spatial codes point to different sides of space, and this conflict must 91 be resolved, a process that takes time and is error-prone (R\u00f6der, Kusmierek, 92 Spence, & Schicke, 2007; Simon, Hinrichs, & Craft, 1970) . In this view, the TOJ 93 crossing effect is a marker for the presence of conflict and, thus, for the fact that 94 remapping into an external spatial code has taken place. Notably, the interpretation 95 that the TOJ crossing effect derives from a remapped stimulus location is indirect 96 because participants only report a binary decision about which hand was 97 stimulated, not the spatial location of the perceived stimulus. Increasing the 98 distance between the uncrossed hands can slightly reduce errors in TOJ ( ",

Our conclusion is, however, in fact compatible with 541 that of another recent study in which participants performed TOJ of tactile stimuli 542 presented to the hands and feet (Badde et al., 2019) . In that study, stimuli were 543 presented to two of the four limbs (hands and feet), but it was unknown to the 544 participant which two limbs would be stimulated in a given trial. Accordingly, four 545 rather than just two response options were always available. In a percentage of 546 trials, participants systematically assigned the first touch to a limb that had not 547 received a tactile stimulus at all during the respective trial. For instance, after 548 stimulation of the left hand and the right foot, a participant may have indicated that 549 the first stimulus had occurred on the right hand. These errors depended on 550 whether the arms and/or legs were crossed. Importantly, neither the side of space 551 of the limb that had received the correct stimulus, nor the spatial distance between 552 stimulus and response limb, were indicative of the erroneously chosen, 553 unstimulated limb -again incompatible with the prevailing view that crossing 554 effects reflect conflict during the integration of anatomical and spatial stimulus 555 location. Instead, participants responded with unstimulated limbs that occupied the 556 space anywhere around the body side of the correct, first tactile stimulus, 557 independent of whether that limb was crossed or not. Thus, what mattered for limb 558 assignment was not the precise, spatial location of the stimulus, but much broader, 559 global spatial stimulus features such as an entire side of the body and its 560 surrounding space. Critically, these global features explained behavior without 561 .

The space-to limb reconstruction hypothesis 243 posits that the spatial location of the first tactile stimulus is represented correctly, 244 and that a limb assignment entails computing which limb was at that spatial 245 location when the stimulus occurred. Thus, in our task, responses with the 246 incorrect hand would result from assigning the incorrect hand to the correct spatial 247 location of the first tactile stimulus (see Fig. 1B). Accordingly, the chosen, incorrect 248 hand should be directed to the location at which the stimulus of the other, correct 249 hand had occurred, and the reported stimulus location in TOJ error trials should 250 scatter around the movement trajectory of the correct hand. Contrary to this 251 prediction, participants pointed to locations scattered around the movement 252 trajectory of the chosen, incorrect hand (see also Fig. 2B), indicating that the 253 chosen stimulus had been perceived on the incorrect hand (see Fig. 4 for the 254 localization responses of the participant with the largest variability in localization 255 errors).

Indeed, comparison of a model with and without 351 intercept did not provide statistical evidence to reject a zero time shift ( 2 (1) = 0.84, 352 p = 0.36). In line with this result, a Bayesian analysis of a model with a random 353 participant factor and a population-level intercept estimated the population 354 intercept at 6 ms, and the 95% confidence range [-8.28; 19.27 ms] included 0. 355 Model comparison via leave-one-out cross-validation found a model without 356 population intercept to be more credible (difference of expected log predictive 357 density, ELPD, for second as compared to first model: -0.6, s.e. 0.9). In contrast, 358 the average time shift between localization errors for correct TOJ trials at time 2 359 and TOJ error trials was -105 (s.e., 7) ms, and a model without intercept fit this 360 condition siginificantly worse than a model that included the intercept ( 2 (1) = 361 19.38, p < 0.001). The significant difference to time 2 suggests that participants 362 did not aim at the position of the second stimulus in TOJ error trials. While neither 363 the non-significant difference to time 1 in the LMM analysis, nor the Bayesian 364 parameter estimate including 0 statistically imply equality of the error curves in 365 correct and incorrect TOJ trials, these statistical results are consistent with the two 366 conditions being equal, and they suggest that, if a difference exists, it is small. 367 Furthermore, the time shift of -105 ms for time 2 closely matches the stimulus SOA 368 of Experiment 1 suggest that when asked to localize the external 376 location of the first of to two tactile stimuli applied in succession to different hands, 377 participants chose which hand received the stimulus and then inferred the location 378 of the chosen limb at the time point of the first stimulus. Consequently, when 379 participants chose the incorrect limb, stimulus location was determined as the 380 location at which the incorrect hand was at the correct (first) time point. While these 381 results support the time reconstruction hypothesis, it should be realized that 382 Experiment 1 tested only a single SOA of 110 ms between the two tactile stimuli. 383 If our conclusions drawn from Experiment 1 are correct, then localization of stimuli 384 assigned to the incorrect hand should always depend on the first stimulus's time, 385 independent of SOA. 386 Experiment 2 tested this conjecture. Again, participants judged which hand had 387 received the first of two tactile stimuli during a bimanual movement and then 388 located the stimulus perceived to have occurred first. We presented tactile stimuli 389 with four different SOAs: 60, 85, 110, and 135 ms. As the estimated localization 390 error curves in Experiment 1 were similar for all combinations of the hands' start 391 and end posture, Experiment 2 involved only reaches from an uncrossed to an 392 uncrossed posture and from a crossed to a crossed posture. This strategy 393 minimized marker obstruction and homogenized movement time across conditions. 394 Experiment 2 was conducted in a different lab than Experiment 1, using different 395 equipment, re-written experimental code, different experimenters, and new 396 with Experiment 1 and previous findings (Heed, M\u00f6ller, et al., 2015; 401 Hermosillo et al., 2011), TOJ performance in Experiment 2 was modulated by hand 402 posture and SOA. At all SOA, participants made large amounts of errors, ensuring 403 that a sufficient number of trials were available to analyze incorrect hand choice 404 trials. Detailed results are reported in the Supplementary Information. 405 Explicit stimulus localization in space 406 Complementing the findings from Experiment 1 and further corroborating the time 407 reconstruction hypothesis, localization errors of the incorrect TOJ trials largely 408 overlapped with the localization errors of correct TOJ trials at time 1 for each of the 409 four SOAs (see Fig. 8) and for each subject and posture condition (Localization curves, averaged across participants and posture, for each of the four SOAs.",

These results 445 were again supported by parameter estimates of Bayesian models equivalent to 446 model without population intercept to be more credible than a model with 450 a common intercept (difference of expected log predictive density, ELPD: -0.2, s.e. 451 0.6) and a model with individual intercepts per SOA (ELPD: -2.2, s.e. 2.2). 452 In contrast, the average time shifts between localization errors for correct 453 TOJ trials at time 2 and TOJ error trials were -52 (s.e., 12) ms, -75 (s.e., 12) ms, -454 87 (s.e., 14) ms, and -104 (s.e., 13) ms for the SOA 60 ms, 85 ms, 110 ms, and 455 135 ms, respectively. A model with a common intercept for all SOAs explained the 456 data significantly better than a model without an intercept ( 2 (1) = 29.27, p < 0.001). 457 A model allowing for different intercepts for each SOA further improved the 458 goodness of fit ( 2 (3) = 14.3, p = 0.003), indicating that localization curve's time 459 shift relative to time 2 depended on the respective SOA (see Supplementary Table 460 3 for Bayesian model estimates). Model comparison via leave-one-out cross-461 validation found a model with individual SOA intercepts to be more credible than a 462 model with a common intercept (difference of expected log predictive density, 463 ELPD: -5.4, s.e. 3.8) and a model without intercept (ELPD: -7.2, s.e. 4.7). 464 Somewhat unexpectedly, the time shift value for the 110 ms SOA in 465 Experiment 2 (-87 ms) diverged more from the SOA compared to Experiment 1 (-466 105 ms, averaged across all four posture conditions). However, in Experiment 2, 467 average time shift values generally underestimated the true SOA. Nontheless, the 468 Bayesian 95% intervals of the intercept estimates included the true SOA for all but 469 the largest SOA (i.e., 135 ms, see Supplementary Table 3). Furthermore, at time 470 1, the estimated intercepts were all slightly (albeit non-significantly) positive (Fig. 471 9 left panel, Supplementary Table 3), and when one considers the difference in 472 time shift (i.e., Time 2 -Time 1), the estimated values match the true SOA more 473 closely (-63 ms, -81 ms, -88 ms, and -120 ms for SOAs 60 ms, 85 ms, 110 ms , 474 and 135 ms, respectively; Fig. 9 right panel). 475 location of tactile stimuli when they make spatial decisions about 478 tactile stimuli. Participants indicated both the target limb and the perceived location 479 in space of the first of two tactile stimuli in a tactile TOJ task. Presentation of stimuli 480 during movement implied that stimulus location depended on stimulation time, 481 allowing us to determine the relationship of stimulus timing and perceived stimulus 482 location in space. If participants had first computed the spatial location, and then 483 derived which limb had occupied this location at time of stimulation (space-to-limb 484 reconstruction hypothesis, see Kitazawa, 2002), incorrect hand assignment should 485 have been associated with external localization along the trajectory of the correct 486 hand; we did not find any evidence for such behavior. If participants had 487 represented stimulus location and stimulated limb together, and simply confused 488 the two due to conflict between different spatial codes (stimulus switch hypothesis), 489 incorrect hand choice should have been associated with spatial localization at the 490 location of the incorrect limb at the second stimulus's time. Localization error 491 curves were incompatible with this view, as their systematic bias differed 492 significantly from a hypothetical localization curve, derived from correct trials, 493 relating to stimulus time 2. Instead, when participants chose the incorrect hand, 494 their localization errors implied that they had aimed at that hand's location at the 495 time of the first, correct stimulus, evident in a close match of localization curves of 496 correct and erroneous TOJ trials when computed relative to stimulus time 1. In 497 other words, participants derived the reported stimulus location by combining the 498 time of the first, correct stimulus with the trajectory of the second, incorrectly 499 chosen hand, effectively indicating a location at which no stimulus had occurred -500 consistent with the time reconstruction hypothesis. This behavior was evident for 501 all combinations of uncrossed and crossed start and end postures, as well as for 502all tested SOAs between the two tactile stimuli. TOJ errors, thus, did not simply 503 reflect temporal confusion of two stimuli; instead, localization in TOJ error trials 504",

Thus, limb crossing paradigms that require 583 limb choices about the origin of touch likely reflect the integration of categorical, 584 tactile-spatial stimulus features. We propose that automatic effects, such as 585 crossmodal, tactile-visual cueing (Aza\u00f1\u00f3n & Soto-Faraco, 2008), too, are based 586 on such feature-based processing. In contrast, precise stimulus location is, 587contrary to what has regularly been implied, not among the pieces of information 588 that are integrated for automatic, tactile-spatial coding.

We have previously proposed a computational model 604 for tactile localization errors that faithfully replicates these biases assuming that 605 participants are uncertain about the time at which the stimulus occurred relative to 606 the movement, and combine a probability distribution of the possible stimulus time 607 with the perceived arm movement trajectory (Maij et al., 2013, 2017, see also Maij 608 et al., 2011 for a visual analogue). The present results are compatible with the 609 temporal uncertainty model. Independent of which hand the stimulus was assigned 610 to, the temporal estimate of the tactile stimulus was identical, resulting in identical 611 localization error profiles, based on the trajectory of the chosen hand, in correct 612 and erroneous TOJ trials. 613 To summarize, we observed the typical dependence of tactile TOJ 614 responses on limb posture, with higher error rates when the hands are crossed 615 rather than uncrossed. Explicit localization responses of the stimulus chosen as 616 having occurred first were incompatible with theoretical accounts that posit 617 confusion of yoked stimulus representations that encompass the independently 618 determined external-spatial location of tactile stimuli, or projection of a body part 619 the first stimulus with the chosen arm's trajectory.

Twelve right-handed participants (aged 19-631 31 years, 7 female) gave informed consent to take part in the experiment. The 632 study was part of a research program approved by the ethics committee of the 633 German Psychological Society (DGPs). Experiment 2 was preregistered at the 634 Open Science Framework website (https://osf.io/qyzgb). A sample size of 20 635 participants was defined a priori. We collected data from 20 individuals from 636 Bielefeld University. We excluded data of 1 participant from analyses as s/he did 637 not follow the instructions and most of the time localized the tactile stimulus at the 638 start or end position, but not along the movement trajectory. Furthermore, we 639 excluded data of another participant as s/he only completed 384 trials in total. As 640 any form of data acquisition was stopped in our lab beginning of March 2020 due 641 to the spread of the corona virus, we did not collect data from replacement 642 participants.

We used this screening 650 procedure because individual response patterns in tactile experiments involving 651 hand crossing are quite variable (Badde et al., 2015; Cadieux et al., 2010; 652 Yamamoto & Kitazawa, 2001); however, crossing effects are highly reliable across 653 the entire population, so that our screening procedure does not blindfolded.

Our objective was to test whether TOJ 141 responses mark the use of the stimulus's precise, external-spatial location 142 constructed in response to the stimulus, or whether instead participants estimate 143 the precise stimulus location post-hoc by integrating the hand movement trajectory 144 with stimulus time. In other words, we aimed to directly contrast the three 145 discussed hypotheses for tactile localization: the space-to-limb reconstruction 146 hypothesis, the stimulus switch hypothesis, and the time reconstruction 147 hypothesis. 148 We presented human participants with two tactile stimuli during a bimanual 149 movement and assessed which hand participants perceived to have been 150 stimulated first (TOJ hand assignment), as well as exactly where in space 151 participants had perceived it (tactile stimulus localization). The experimental logic, 152 and its relation to the three tested tactile localization hypotheses, are illustrated in 153 Fig. 1. Because tactile stimuli were presented shortly before, after, and during the 154 time of movement, their precise spatial location depended on their timing relative 155 to the movement. This allowed us to determine the precise tactile spatial location 156 participants had perceived when they had made a hand assignment error in the 157 TOJ task. Contrary to common opinion, TOJ errors were not associated with the 158 location of the second, incorrect stimulus. Instead, when participants chose the 159 incorrect hand, they reported its location at the time point at which the other, correct 160 stimulus had occurred. Thus, participants constructed stimulus location by 161 combining the position of the incorrectly chosen hand with the stimulus timing that 162 belonged to the other, non-chosen hand's stimulus, resulting in reported locations 163 at which no stimulus had ever occurred. This finding invalidates current 164 explanations of crossing effects as being based on the precise, remapped external 165 spatial location of the tactile stimulus. 166",
