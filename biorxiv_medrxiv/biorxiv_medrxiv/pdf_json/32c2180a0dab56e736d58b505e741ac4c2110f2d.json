The magnitude of the decline has varied between regions and increasing divergence across the regions has been observed in their relative emphasis on public health and curative services. In collaboration with the private sector, some regions, including Lombardy, have created an extensive network of curative services and hospitals but have decreased funding for public health field activities and public laboratories (4) . Others, such as Veneto, have continued to support a strong public health network with community outreach. Organizational changes have occurred over time that reflect the changing emphasis on curative services. In some regions, including Lombardy, public health services and hospitals have separate management structures, while in others, such as Veneto, most or all of the hospitals are managed by local health units that also provide preventive services. The response to the pandemic in the two regions reflects these differences.",

They gradually moved non-COVID-19 patients out of the designated COVID-19 hospitals, generally to smaller community hospitals set aside for non-COVID-19 patients. In addition to strengthening the ability to care for patients, however, enhanced public health measures were also developed and implemented. Though a series of meetings and written communications with leaders of local health units and hospitals, regional leadership implemented an articulated community-based strategy. Key elements are presented in the Box, but they included extensive contact tracing, rapid testing of both cases and an extended network of contacts, supervised quarantine and isolation, minimization of contact between HCW and the public, and informatics systems for rapid communication on case diagnosis and management and for monitoring bed availability. All non-essential public health activities were promptly put on hold, and a force of more than 750 public health workers throughout the region was mobilized.",

As stated by clinicians from one of the most heavily affected hospitals in Lombardy, \"Western health care systems have been built around the concept of patient-centered care, but an epidemic requires a change of perspective toward a concept of community-centered care.\" (17) Veneto's greater integration of its public health and hospital services at local level and strong public health infrastructure potentiated the implementation of a community-based approach.

This strategy also allowed exposed HCWs to more efficiently and effectively use scarce personal protective equipment (PPE).

Veneto, with its real-time integrated information system, may have had more complete and accurate case reporting. However, if cases and deaths were more likely to be notified than in Veneto than in Lombardy the effect would be to underestimate rates for Lombardy and increase, rather than decrease observed differences in the case and death rates between the two regions. Differences in HCW testing could have also affected our results. HCWs in Veneto who have been in close contact with cases but do not have symptoms are tested three times over fourteen days as part of the policy to keep them on the job. This testing policy in Veneto would likely lead to the detection of more HCW cases compared with Lombardy, but the effect would be in the direction of increasing the observed difference in HCW rates of infection between Veneto and Lombardy. Finally, our denominators for HCWs did not include those employed privately.

            "text": "Currently, the applicability of the community approach may be limited to countries where public health and curative services are integrated. In other countries such as the United States, where health care is privatized, and integration with public health services is limited, it nonetheless may be possible to implement most of the major components in specific settings. One such setting may be Kaiser Permanente, which covers an estimated population of 12.2 million and integrates prevention and treatment, has its own laboratories and hospitals, has a tradition of community-based care, maintains a sophisticated information system, and often has good working relationships with local health departments that are responsible for contact tracing. However, even in settings where full implementation is not possible, it may be feasible to identify human and financial resources to increase non-facility-based screening, contact tracing, and home follow-up activities rather than providing expensive and labor-intense hospital-based care, which appears to result in poorer patient and HCW outcomes. In preparation for additional waves, every effort should be made to strengthen health department capacity for extensive contact tracing and isolation, community monitoring of patients, and communication between public health and health care providers and to establish robust informatics systems that allow for real-time information transfer among the many entities involved in controlling community spread.",
