In the present study, we have screened 38 and shortlisted 38 CTL, 33 HTL and 12 B cell epitopes from the eleven Protein 39 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 by utilizing different in silico tools. The screened 40 epitopes were further validated for their binding with their respective HLA allele 41 binders and TAP (Transporter associated with antigen processing) molecule by 42 molecular docking. The shortlisted screened epitopes were further utilized to 43 design novel two multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) composed of CTL, HTL and B 44 cell epitopes overlaps with potential to elicit humoral as well as cellular immune 45 response against SARS-CoV-2. To enhance the immune response for our 46 vaccine design, truncated (residues 10-153) Onchocerca volvulus activation-47 associated secreted protein-1 (Ov-ASP-1) has been utilized as an adjuvant at N 48 terminal of both the MEVs. Further molecular models for both the MEVs were 49 prepared and validated for their stable molecular interactions with Toll-Like 50 Receptor 3 (TLR 3). The codon-optimized cDNA of both the MEVs were further 51 analyzed for their potential of high level of expression in a human cell line.

The smaller the value of percentile rank 628 the higher would be the affinity of the peptide with its respective HLA allele 629 binders. The 33 epitopes with high percentile ranking were shortlisted ( Omega. The analysis has shown that several epitopes of CTL, HTL and B cell 728 were having amino acid sequences overlap. The CTL, HTL and B cell epitopes 729 having two or more than two amino acid residues overlap are shown in Fig.2 .

Both the tools use six different methods 271 (viz.

TAP score estimates an effective log -(IC50) values (half maximal 275 inhibitory concentration (IC50) for binding to TAP of a peptide or its N-terminal 276 prolonged precursors. The MHC binding prediction score is -log(IC50) values for 277 binding to MHC of a peptide (Calis et al., 2013).
