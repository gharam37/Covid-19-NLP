            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China has rapidly propagated due to widespread person-to-person transmission and has resulted in over 1,133,758 cases in 197 countries with a total of 62,784 deaths as of April 5, 2020. Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 is performed with a virus-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. This test can take up to two days to complete, and, due to the possibility of false negatives, serial testing may be required to reliably exclude infection. A current supply shortage of RT-PCR test kits compounds the shortcomings of entrusting diagnosis to the PCR test alone and underscores the urgent need to provide alternative methods for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 patients. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, CT alone may have limited negative predictive value to fully exclude infection, because of the normal radiologic findings in some early disease patients. In this study, we use artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history, and/or laboratory testing to more accurately and rapidly diagnose SARS-CoV-2 (+) patients. We included 905 RT-PCR confirmed patients. 419 (46.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by laboratory-confirmed realtime RT-PCR assay and next-generation sequencing, while 486 patients (53.8%) tested negative (confirmed by at least two additional negative RT-PCR tests and clinical observation). The proposed AI system achieved an AUC of 0.92 and performed equally well in sensitivity compared to a senior thoracic radiologist on a testing set of 279 cases. The AI system also improved the detection of RT-PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 patients who presented with normal CTs, correctly identifying 17/25 (68%) patients, whereas all 25 RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2-positive CT-normal patients were classified as SARS-CoV-2 negative by radiologists.",

Early recognition of the disease is crucial not only for individual patient care related to rapid implementation of treatment, but also from a larger public health perspective to ensure adequate patient isolation and disease containment. Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 is performed with a virus-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but the test can take up to two days to complete, and due to the possibility of false negatives serial testing may be required to reliably exclude infection. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component of evaluation and diagnosis in symptomatic patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chest CT is more sensitive and specific than chest radiography in evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, and there have been cases where CT findings were present prior to clinical symptomatology onset 4 .",

The CNN model can then be seen as a classifier that reports whether its receptive field is SARS-CoV-2 (+). The label of an image is then predicted by combining all predictions of every local region over the whole image. Max pooling serves as an \"OR\" gate that labels an image as SARS-CoV-2 (+) if there is any subregion in it that is SARS-CoV-2 (+). Patient level prediction was set as the average of image-level prediction of a patient's 10 most abnormal images. To visualize the CNN's prediction, we up-sampled the CNN's outputs, without applying the max pooling layer, to the original image size. The lung mask was applied to up-sampled outputs for clear visualization.",
