We analyzed more than 100 millions Twitter messages posted worldwide in 64 languages during the epidemic emergency due to SARS-CoV-2 and classified the reliability of news diffused. We found that waves of unreliable and low-quality information anticipate the epidemic ones, exposing entire countries to irrational social behavior and serious threats for public health. When the epidemics hit the same area, reliable information is quickly inoculated, like antibodies, and the system shifts focus towards certified informational sources. Contrary to mainstream beliefs, we show that human response to falsehood exhibits early-warning signals that might be mitigated with adequate communication strategies.",

Contrary to what it could be expected in principle, what this natural experiment reveals is that, on the verge of a threatening global pandemic emergency due to SARS-CoV-2 23-25 , human communication activity is to a significant extent characterized by the intentional production of informational noise and even of misleading or false information 26 . This generates waves of unreliable and low-quality information with potentially very dangerous impacts on the social capacity to respond adaptively at all scales by rapidly adopting those norms and behaviors that may effectively contain the propagation of the epidemics. Spreading false information or even conspiracy theories that support implausible explanations of the causal forces at work behind the crisis may create serious confusion and even discourage people from taking the crisis seriously or responsibly, all the more so, the more such signals receive social validation and spread across social groups and communities 27 . Therefore, if on the one hand we face the risks of a global epidemics threat, requiring outstanding efforts for modeling and anticipating the time course of the spreading 25 , on the other hand we can speak of an infodemics threat 28 , where low-quality content provides an alternative for news consumption to unclear official communications. The infodemics can be thought, similarly to epidemics, as an outbreak of false rumors and fake news with unexpected effects on social dynamics (see Fig. 1 ). In fact, the dangerousness of infodemics can compare and sum up to a large extent to that of the epidemics itself 29 . Fig. 1 : How infodemics works . Human and non-human accounts forge unreliable content -such as fake or untrustworthy news -about the COVID19, a topic attracting the collective attention of the whole world. Their followers are exposed to such content, and reshare it, becoming infectious agents:",

In a low-risk country such as South Korea, the level of infodemic risk remains small throughout apart from an isolated spike in the early phase. As the contagion spreads to significant levels, the infodemic risk further decreases, signalling an increasing focus of the public opinion toward reliable news sources. Canada presents a slightly higher level of infodemic risk, and unlike South Korea, we see that the risk level increases as the epidemics spread, but stays at low levels. At the opposite, in a high-risk country such as Venezuela, the infodemics is in full swing throughout the period of observation, and in addition to the expected activity from unverified sources one notices that even verified ones contribute to a large extent to the infodemics. The relationship with biological contagion patterns cannot be checked here due to lack of reliable data. Finally, in a relatively high-risk country such as Russia we notice that infodemic risk is erratic with sudden, very pronounced spikes, and again also verified sources play a major role. Here too, information about the epidemics is fragmented and mostly unreliable. Overall, the global level of infodemic risk tends to decrease as the epidemics spread globally, suggesting that evidence of the expansion of the contagion leads people to look for relatively more reliable sources, and that verified influencers with many followers started inoculating the system with more reliable news (see Supplementary Figures 3 and 4) , playing a role that presents interesting analogies to that of antibodies in the treatment of an infectious disease. This overall pattern is confirmed in terms of measures of Infodemic Risk aggregated daily and at country level ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 5 ). The effect is particularly pronounced with the escalation of the epidemics, suggesting that this effect could be mediated by levels of perceived social alarm. It is also interesting to observe though that countries with high infodemic risk might also be more unreliable in terms of 10 .

Fig. 4 shows, however, that the relationship between reduction of infodemic risk and expansion of the epidemics seems to be a rather general trend, as the relationship between number of confirmed cases and infodemic risk is (nonlinearly) negative, confirming the result shown in Fig. 3 . Fig. 4 also shows how the evolution of infodemic risk among countries with both high message volume and significant epidemic contagion tends to be very asymmetric, with major roles played not only by countries such as Iran, but also United States, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Norway maintaining their relative levels, and other countries like Italy, South Korea and Japan significantly reducing it with the progression of the epidemics.",

We focused on Twitter, which is well-known for providing access to publicly available messages upon specific requests through their application programming interface (API). We have identified a set of hashtags and keywords gaining special collective attention, namely: coronavirus, ncov, #Wuhan, covid19, covid-19, sarscov2, covid . This set includes the official name of the virus and the disease, including the preliminary ones, as well as the name of the city of the first epidemic outbreak. We have used the Filter API -to collect the data in real time from 24 Jan 2020 to 10 Mar 2020 -and of the Search API -to collect the data between 21 Jan 2020 and 24 Jan 2020. Our choice allowed us to monitor, without interruptions and regardless of the language, all the tweets posted about COVID19 since when China reported more than 6,000 cases (20 Jan 2020), calling for the attention of the international community. The Stream API has the advantage of providing all the messages satisfying our selection criteria and posted to the platform in the period of observation, provided that their volume is not larger than 1% of the overall -unfiltered -volume of posted messages. Above 1% of the overall flow of information, the Filter API provides a sample of filtered tweets and communicates an estimate of the amount of lost messages. Note that this choice is the safest as to date: in fact, it has been recently shown that biases affecting Sample API (which samples data based on rate limits), for instance, are not found in REST and Filter APIs 40 . We estimate that until 24 Feb 2020 we lost about 60,000 tweets out of millions, capturing more than 99.5% of all messages posted (see Supplementary Fig. 1) . The global attention towards COVID19 increased the volume of messages after 25 Feb 2020: however, Twitter restrictions allowed us to get no more than 4.5 millions messages per day, on average. We have estimated a total of 161.2 millions tweets posted until 10 Mar 2020: we have successfully collected 112.6 millions of them, providing an unprecedented opportunity for infodemics analysis.",

Perceived and actual biological and social risks feed upon one another, and may co-evolve in complex ways. Especially in situations where effective therapies to contrast the diffusion of the pandemic are not readily available, coordination of behaviors and diffusion of pro-social orientations driven by reliable information at all scales are the key resources for the mitigation of adverse effects. In this perspective, we can therefore think of an integrated public health approach where the biological and informational dimensions are equally recognized, taken into account, and managed through careful policy design. This could potentially include the birth of new, highly specialized professional figures such as that of the \"infodemiologist\".Here, we have shown that in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, complex infodemic effects are indeed at work, with significant variations across countries, where level of socio-economic development is not the key discriminant to separate countries with high vs. low infodemic risk. In fact, we find that there are G9 countries with remarkable infodemic risk and developing countries with far lower risk levels. This means that, especially in countries where infodemic risk is high, the eventual speed and the containment of the COVID-19 could depend on a prompt regime switch in communication strategies and in the effective countervailing of the most active sources of the most dangerous categories of fake news. The escalation of the epidemics leads people to progressively pay attention to more reliable sources thus potentially limiting the impact of the infodemics, but the actual speed of adjustment may make a major difference in determining the social outcome, and in particularbetween a controlled epidemics and a global pandemics. This casts new light on the social mechanics of the infodemics-epidemics interaction, and may be of help to policy makers to design a more integrated strategic approach, by suitably embedding communication and information management into a comprehensive, extended public health perspective. inflammatory content in online social systems.

All distributions display a fat-tail, but different categories of users have a different outreach. The unverified profiles have a significantly smaller number of followers than the verified ones. At the same time, profiles identified as bots have a larger number of followers. The average values are: 660 for Unverified Humans (circles), 1400 for Unverified Bots (squares, 51k for Verified Humans (stars) and 240k for Verified Bots (diamonds). Supplementary Fig. 5 : A second aggregated view of the evolution of risk index for increasing number of confirmed cases. Differently from Fig. 3 , here we compute the average risk index for a single day in each country (instead of the cumulative value), for a total of 177 countries excluding China the origin of the COVID19 outbreak. We first compute the average value for days with no confirmed cases, which is 0.276 (blue line in figure) . We then aggregate all days with confirmed cases in homogeneous bins and compute the average values (red points). We observe that reporting of the first case is associated with a drop in the risk index, followed by an increase back to the \"natural level\" in correspondence of 3 confirmed cases. Then, as the epidemics gain strength, the infodemic risk index decreases again, confirming what observed in Fig. 3 .
