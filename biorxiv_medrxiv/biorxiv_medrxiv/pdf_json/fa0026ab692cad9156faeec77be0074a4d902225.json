In individual cases, divorces and separations can be beneficial to individual health and stress levels (for example in situations of abuse). Overall, however, even after taking into account risk factors that contribute to divorce and separation (i.e. financial stressors, mental and physical illness and substance abuse), divorce and separation given the experience of relational and economic stress, loss, and greater likelihood for social isolation, have been shown to have a negative impact on longevity (10). Causes for this may also include detrimental habits that individuals may adopt to cope with the stress, loss, and isolation (such as increased smoking (40)). Additionally having parents who divorce during childhood has been estimated to increase mortality by 44% and reduce life expectancy by an average of 4 years (41).",

At the time of writing there over two million reported cases worldwide and more than 130,000 deaths attributed to COVID19 acute infection (1) . Based on models of its spread, and potential for morbidity and mortality that predicted high COVID-19 associated morbidity and mortality, most governments worldwide have adopted mitigation strategies that are essentially aiming to reduce the spread of the virus by limiting social contacts (2, 3) . The aim of these measures would be to \"flatten the curve\" of acute presentations to prevent widespread morbidity and the break-down of the health care systems. Variants of these social mitigation strategies ranged from \"social distancing\", which more broadly encompasses measures of at-home-confinement, referred to as \"self-isolation\", selective \"quarantine\" to population \"lockdown\" that includes restriction of movement outdoors and closure of schools and all non-essential services and businesses.",

To exemplify the scope, studies from the SARS epidemic found that the length of quarantine was an important predictor of PTSD, depression and anxiety with a cumulative prevalence potentially exceeding 30% of the population (8, 9) . Psychosocial stressors such as marriage separations and loneliness are also likely to spike in confinement and have adverse effects to mental and physical health (10) (11) (12) (13) . Available data suggest that stress associated with population-wide disasters increase the level of violence, including domestic violence and child abuse (14, 15) .

However, the risk of suicide for prisoners in single cells is further increased approximately 9 to 15 times (27) . Extrapolating from data on prisoners, we assume that confinement in the household increases their likelihood of suicide by a factor of 3 in multi-person households and a factor of 27 in single-person households (3*9). We assume this increase is stable for the entire 3-month duration. In Switzerland, 16% of the population live in single-households (28). This results in a population-wide PRi of 6.84 General: As mood and anxiety disorders are comorbid, we used data on depression in our model as it is likely to capture much of the distress related psychopathology; additionally, depression has the most convincing link to YLL which is our outcome of interest (29) .",

In this sense, our model projection is obviously constrained by the limitations of the available literature which, itself, involves a number of unknowns. Given the time constraints, the uncertainty in those assumptions is increased; the authors however judge the urgency of such projections to be very high at the moment. Additionally, the present projection does not pretend to be all-encompassing concerning effects of confinement, several other effects are likely to be adverse, such as -for example-increases in prolonged grief disorder, elder abuse, increase of sedentary lifestyle or change 9 of diet for example. The projection also does not account for potentially beneficial changes in behaviour, for example reductions in car accidents. Furthermore, the model does not include an economic component as a result of COVID-19 mitigation, nor interaction of such a n economic component with psychosocial risk factors. Due to frequent co-occurrence of certain phenomena it is possible that a single individual may be affected by more than one of the factors presented. Where possible data that was adjusted adequately for age, sex and socio-economics was applied, but for several factors, possibilities to do so were limited by the current state of the literature.",
