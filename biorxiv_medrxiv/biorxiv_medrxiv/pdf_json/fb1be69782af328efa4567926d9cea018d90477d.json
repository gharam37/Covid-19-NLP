Canada 5 Halim.maaroufi@ibis.ulaval.ca 6 7 ABSTRACT The novel betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious and can cause 8 serious acute respiratory illness syndromes, often fatal, called covid-19. It is an urgent priority to 9 better understand SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms that will help in the development of 10 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutics that are very important to people health and socioeconomic 11 stability around the world. The surface coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein is considered as a key 12 factor in host specificity because it mediates infection by receptor-recognition and membrane 13 fusion. Here the analysis of CoV-2 S protein revealed in S1subunit a B56-binding LxxIxE-like 14 motif that could recruit the host protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). This motif is absent in SARS-15 CoV and MERS-CoV. PP2A is a major family of serine/threonine phosphatases in eukaryotic cells. 16 Phosphatases and kinases are big players in the regulation of pro-inflammatory responses during 17 pathogenic infections. Moreover, studies have shown that viruses use multiple strategies to target 18 PP2A in order to manipulate host's antiviral responses. The latest studies have indicated that 19 SARS-CoV-2 is involved in sustained inflammation in the host. Therefore, by controlling acute 20 inflammation; it is possible to eliminate its dangerous effects on the host. Among efforts to fight 21 covid-19, the interaction between LxxIxE-like motif and PP2A-B56-binding pocket could be a 22 target for the development of a bioactive peptide and ligand inhibitors for therapeutic purposes.",

It is a key piece of viral host recognition (receptor-46 recognition) and organ tropism and induces strongly the host immune reaction (Li, 2015) . It is 47 subdivided to S1 subunit that binds to a receptor on the host cell surface and S2 subunit that permits 48 viral and host membranes fusion. S1 subunit is divided into two domains, an N-terminal domain 49 (NTD) and a C-terminal receptor-binding domain (RBD) that can function as viral receptors-50 binding (Li, 2012) .

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family 31 of enveloped single positive-stranded RNA viruses that can infect both mammalian and avian 32 species because their rapid mutation and recombination facilitate their adaptation to new hosts 33 (Graham and Baric, 2010; Li, 2013). They can cause severe, often fatal acute respiratory disease 34 syndromes named covid-19. CoVs are classified into Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and 35 Deltacoronavirus genetic genera. The novel betacoronavirus (betaCoVs) SARS-CoV-2 is 36 relatively close to other betaCoVs: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 37 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), bat coronavirus HKU4, mouse 38 hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and human OC43 coronavirus (HCoV-39 OC43). SARS-CoV emerged in China (2002-2003) and spread to other countries (more than 8,000 40 infection cases and a fatality rate of ~10%) (Peiris et al., 2003). In 2012, MERS-CoV was detected 41 in the Middle East. It spread to multiple countries, infecting more than 1,700 people with a fatality 42 rate of ~36%.",
