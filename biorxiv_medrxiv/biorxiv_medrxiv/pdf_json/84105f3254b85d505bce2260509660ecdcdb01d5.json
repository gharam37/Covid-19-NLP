Given the high spread potential and severity of SARS-CoV2, local overdose may be sacrificed in order to minimise contamination risk by underexposure, as most FFRs can tolerate higher than germicidal doses. However, protocols for mask descontamination inside rooms with powerful UV-C sources might not ensure an even dosage distribution among masks placed at different angles from the lamp.",

In order to evaluate the optimal orientation of the respirators inside the chamber, several dosage measurements were done. The first measurements were obtained with the grating located at a vertical distance of 10 cm from the luminaires plane and with a sigle respirator inside the chamber located near the wall without luminaires. The detector was placed just at the right of the respirator at the first measure (see figure 2a) . A dosage of 550 W/cm2 was obtained.

The first model was simulated with a truncated pyramid of dimensions (long, width, high) 17cm x 4cm x 9cm. The base of 4 cm corresponds to the case were the masks are slightly open. The second model was simulated with a truncated pyramid of dimensions 17cm x 9cm x 5cm. The masks were placed in two rows and three columns as they are planned to be in the disinfection box. Additionally, two different orientations were simulated with respect to the long side of the box, parallel and perpendicular. Blue colors correspond to a reference amount of light. Green color represents a value equal to two times the reference value, yellow corresponds to three times, amber to four times, and red to 5 times. Similarity was observed between the measured data and the simulations. In both cases, as long as we move away from L2, a reduction in the irradiance is calculated, getting the minimum exposure in the right side of the respirator mask on the right. Both, measured data and simulations reflect that in region C of figure 4 we get half of the exposure obtained at D, and one third of that at E. Additionally, comparing the two light distribution obtained for the two orientations of the respiratory masks, the shadows obtained with the masks parallel to the long side of the box, are less pronounced. Hence, this orientation is suggested as the preferred one. Figure 5 compares the pseudocolor maps of the light distribution inside the disinfection box using three and four lamps. Note the difference between using three or four lamps, as four lamps provide a more uniform light distribution with less difference in the light amount. With four lamps we also diminish the shadows in the face of the mask of the right side.",

In addition, adding light sources on both sides of the rack might provide more reliable illumination avoiding over and underexposure.
