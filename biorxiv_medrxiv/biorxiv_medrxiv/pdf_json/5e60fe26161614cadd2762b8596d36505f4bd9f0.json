Higher morbidity and mortality of men with COVID-19 may be explained by androgen-driven mechanisms. One such proposed mechanism is androgen regulation of pulmonary TMPRSS2, the host co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2. We find no evidence for increased TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in the lungs of males compared to females in humans or mice. Furthermore, in male mice, treatment with the androgen receptor antagonist enzalutamide does not decrease pulmonary TMPRSS2 expression. Nevertheless, regardless of sex, smoking significantly increases the expression of TMPRSS2, which reverts back to never-smoker levels in former smokers. Finally, we show that in mouse models, despite equivalent AR transcript levels, males express markedly higher amounts of AR protein. If a similar sex-specific regulation of AR protein occurs in human lung, androgens could play important roles in clinical outcome of COVID-19 through mechanisms other than TMPRSS2 regulation. author/funder.

One recent study of 1,099 COVID-19-positive patients reported a more than two-fold increased risk for intensive care unit admission and death in smokers as compared with non-smokers (Guan et al., 2020) . We identified human expression GEO datasets of bronchial/airway epithelial cells containing subject smoking status and asked whether smoking is associated with TMPRSS2 expression. Our analysis indicated a consistent pattern where expression of both TMPRSS2 (Fig. 3A ) and the primary SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 ( Fig.3B ) was modestly but significantly increased in smokers compared with non-smokers. Interestingly, the levels were downregulated to never-smoker levels in former smokers. The results of our analysis are in keeping with several recent reports on ACE2 and smoking (Brake et al., 2020; Leung et al., 2020; Smith and Sheltzer, 2020) .",

It is not yet known whether these changes in expression have a functional impact on COVID-19 infection, but if they do, the results suggest smokers could partly mitigate their increased risk by quitting smoking.
