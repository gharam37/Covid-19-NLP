Numerical simulations show that strict suppression measures at the beginning of an epidemic can create low infectious numbers, which thereafter can be managed by mitigation measures over longer periods to flatten the epidemic curve. The stronger the suppression measure, the faster it achieves the low numbers of infections that are conducive to subsequent management. Our results on short-term strategies point to either a two-step control strategy, following failed mitigation, that begins with suppression of the reproduction number, \u211bC, below 1.0, followed by renewed mitigation measures that manage the epidemic by maintaining \u211bC at approximately 1.0, or should suppression not be feasible, the progressive lowering of \u211bC below 1.0. The full sequence of measures that we are observing in a number of countries, and likely to see in the longer term, can be symbolically represented as: \u211b0 \u00e0 \u211bC<\u211b0 \u00e0 \u211bC<<1.0 \u00e0 \u211bC\u22481.0 \u00e0 \u211bC<1.0. We discuss the predictions of this analysis and how it fits into longer-term sequences of measures.",

'Suppression measures' are engaged early and decisively to lower the reproduction number, \u211b, below 1.0 and as close as possible to 0.0. When successful, this results in low, manageable numbers of infections, and can then be followed by a second strategy: 'Mitigation measures' that flatten the epidemic curve by maintaining the reproduction number to approximately 1.0. However, strategies need not follow this sequence. For those countries reacting very early in an outbreak, mitigation measures alone may be sufficient. For those that are late and/or unable to employ radical suppression measures, 'progressive mitigation' so as to lower \u211b below 1.0 may be the only alternative.",

Clearly, any subsequent mitigation measures yielding \u211bC<1.0 would result in infectious cases decreasing over time (and therefore be a successful outcome), but given the impacts of such measures on society, below we consider strategies that seek to contain a second epidemic by tuning \u211bC to between 1.0 and \u211b0. the infectious numbers to less than 10% of the total population requires \u211bC less than c.1. 5 , which is about a 40% reduction in the \u211b0 assumed here ( Fig. 2A) . Peak levels of hospitalization can reach c.7%-10% should mitigation measures be 20% or less effective at reducing \u211b0 (Fig. 2B) . Such levels would exceed hospital bed capacity in most countries by at least an order of magnitude (18). Reducing peak hospitalization levels well below 1% (which is still too high for many health services) would require \u211bC close to 1.0. Finally, similar to the trends in Figs. 2A,B , fatalities are sensitive to the effectiveness of prior suppression measures and community size, indicating that \u211bC needs to be reduced towards unity for smaller communities and those unable to reduce infectious cases sufficiently during suppression measures (Fig. 2C) . These results emphasize that epidemics could be contained by tuning \u211bC close to, but above 1.0, which would be more logistically and socially attainable than \u211bC<1.0.",

'Suppression measures' would be adopted by communities that either initially decided not (or did, but were unable) to mitigate the exponential increase of new cases. Suppression reduces the reproduction number sufficiently below 1.0, and in so doing lower the number of infectious cases to a manageable level. 'Mitigation measures' may either be introduced as a preventive approach, whereby communities begin to manage very early in the outbreak, gradually introduced towards the end of suppression, or for countries unable or unwilling to enforce suppression measures, the only route possible to flatten the epidemic curve.

A number of tactics have been proposed and some variously adopted by different communities, including: spatial distancing, quarantining, hand washing, wearing masks, gloves; diagnostics such as contact tracing, and virus and antibody testing; and interventions such as employing repurposed drugs and developing vaccines. Such approaches will need to be employed in complementary ways, since no single one is likely to attain reset or management objectives. Moreover, calibration of \u211bC in particular will require accurate assessments of the contribution of asymptomatic transmission to the propagation of the virus, the latter having been recently demonstrated in mathematical models to potentially influence COVID-19 dynamics (23).",
