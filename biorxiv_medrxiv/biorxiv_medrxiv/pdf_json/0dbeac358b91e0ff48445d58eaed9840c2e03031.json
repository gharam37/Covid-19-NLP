[3, 4] Italy has been one of the first countries facing the epidemic outside of China and surely up to the end of March 2020, it was the most affected Western country. [5, 6] The spectrum of disease of COVID-19 is wide, ranging from no symptoms at all to severe mixed interstitial-alveolar pneumonia often requiring admission in an intensive care unit and ventilation. Fatality rates are high, ranging from 2% to 12%, depending on the country, on reporting systems and definitions, and on length of follow up since disease onset. [7] Further, hospitalization rates change according to different approaches to care and to varying availability of hospital beds; the latter also depends on the place and the phase of the epidemic. [7] Since we are facing a new disease, very few studies can provide information on the factors explaining the variability observed in the fatality rate and on how to predict whether the disease will be severe or not. Therefore, it is hard to define the prognosis both for individuals and for groups of patients. Age and sex seem to be the only confirmed and well described prognostic factors, with a higher case fatality rate in older subjects and in males. [8, 9] Pre-existing chronic conditions have been generically reported as poor prognosis determinants, but the strength of the association between each specific comorbidity and outcomes has not yet been fully explored. [10, 11] Indeed, gaining a better understanding of the role of the main prognostic factors and quantifying the strength of their association with the rate of occurrence of a critical event is essential to identifying patients at high risk of worsening clinical conditions and to assessing the actual needs of different patient groups.",

In particular, a first multivariate model was fitted separately for hospitalization and death, including age, sex, Charlson Index, and place of birth as covariates. Then, in order to estimate the actual association between different types of comorbidities with the events of interest, a second model was used that included with the already mentioned covariates the individual comorbidities instead of the Charlson Index. In all the multivariate models we included time from symptom onset to diagnosis (assumed to be a proxy of severity of the disease, as worse-off patients seek medical assistance quicker) and calendar week of diagnosis, both because a variation in patient characteristics over time was observed (data not shown) and because healthcare services experienced different degrees of difficulty in the clinical and organizational management of patients over the weeks due to the different stages of development of the epidemic.",

A hypothesis to explain the higher hospitalization rate may be some genetic background in some of the most represented ethnicities. However, this is quite implausible in the province of Reggio Emilia because immigrants come from very different areas globally, and Eastern Europe, China, South Asia, Northern Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa are equally represented among the most represented areas of origin. Given that excess risk is appreciable only for hospitalization and not for mortality, it is possible that this is due to the difficulty in effective home quarantine for these patients. Finally, considering that most of the countries of origin have a high prevalence of tuberculosis and BCG is thus recommended, our data do not support the hypothesis that the previously observed non-specific protective effect of BCG on other viral infections[25] is also protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Nevertheless, as mentioned above, over the 5 weeks representing the time span of this study we saw an increase in diagnoses among females in the last two weeks of the period under study that was not compatible with a random fluctuation, while in the first three weeks we observed more males. This suggests that some underlying characteristics of the case mix may change during the epidemic as the result of changes in the epidemiology of the disease or of changes in the resources available for testing people with less severe symptoms.",

While an association emerged between ACE inhibitors and hospitalization, it was likely due to residual confounding as it was not confirmed when the comparison between users vs non-users of this drug was performed only among the subgroup of patients with cardiovascular comorbidity. Surprisingly, we found small or no effect for obesity, dyslipidaemia, or vascular diseases. The latter is a quite heterogeneous group of diseases and it is possible that we are missing some important prognostic factor due to this grouping, but numbers did not allow for any further distinction. Nevertheless, our finding is similar to that of Whang and colleagues for cardiovascular disease. [20] The mechanism underlying these associations are mostly unknown. A deeper understanding of the causal chain from infection, disease onset, and immune response to outcomes could lead to an explanation of how these prognostic factors act. Nevertheless, quantifying the strength of association between pre-existing conditions and COVID-19 outcomes is important to understanding the disease.",
