First, the cryo-EM map allows us to build the structure of 2019-nCoV nsp12 covering almost all residues, presenting the first insight into the complete architecture of coronaviral RdRp. In SARS-CoV nsp12, there are seven helices with a three-stranded \u03b2-sheet at the end that make up the NiRAN domain (6) ( Fig. 2A) .

This \u03b2-hairpin inserts in the groove clamped by the NiRAN domain and the palm 5 subdomain in the RdRp domain and forms a set of close contacts to stabilize the overall structure ( Fig. 2B and fig.

The efficacy of chain-terminating nucleotide analogs requires viral RdRps to recognize and successfully incorporate the active form of the inhibitors into the growing RNA strand. Because of the structural conservation on the polymerase catalytic chamber between 2019-nCoV and HCV ns5b polymerase, as well as the likely similar mechanisms of action of remdesivir and sofosbuvir (12, 16) (2'-F-2'-C-methyluridine monophosphate prodrug which targets HCV 45 author/funder.

In 2019-nCoV nsp12, the 2' hydroxyl of the incoming NTP is likely to form hydrogen bonds with T680 and N691 in motif B (Figs. 4, A and B ). In addition, D623 in motif A is positioned to interrogate the 3' hydroxyl through hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the hydrophobic side chain of V557 in motif F is likely to stack with 5 and stabilize the +1 template RNA uridine base to base pair with the incoming triphosphate remdesivir (ppp-remdesivir). In the structures of HCV ns5b elongation complex or its complex with pp-sofosbuvir, a key feature is that the incorporated pp-sofosbuvir disrupts the hydrogen bonding network between S282 and D225 (Figs. 4, C and D), which is necessary to stabilize the incoming natural nucleotide (12). However, key contacts formed by S282 with the incoming 10 nucleotide and the surrounding environment can result in an S\u2192T resistance mutation that is already observed in the clinic (17). In the structure of apo 2019-nCoV nsp12, the orientation of S682 and D623, which are strictly conserved with S282 and D225 in HCV ns5b, is similar to that observed in the HCV ns5b-pp-sofosbuvir complex, indicating a different recognition mechanism with that inhibitor.

First, the cryo-EM map allows us to build the structure of 2019-nCoV nsp12 covering almost all residues, presenting the first insight into the complete architecture of coronaviral RdRp. In SARS-CoV nsp12, there are seven helices with a three-stranded \u03b2-sheet at the end that make up the NiRAN domain (6) ( Fig. 2A) . Residues Y69-R118 constitute an additional structural block with three anti-parallel \u03b2-strands and one helix. Residues N215-D218 form a \u03b2-strand in 2019-nCoV nsp12. We reasoned that the contact of this region with the strand (residues V96-A100) helps to stabilize it. As a result, these four strands form a compact semi \u03b2barrel architecture. Therefore, we identify residues Y69-R249 as the complete coronaviral NiRAN domain. Second, the cryo-EM map helps us to identify a unique N-terminal \u03b2-hairpin (Figs. 1A and 2A). This \u03b2-hairpin inserts in the groove clamped by the NiRAN domain and the palm 5 subdomain in the RdRp domain and forms a set of close contacts to stabilize the overall structure ( Fig. 2B and fig. S5 ). Another point to note is that, we have observed C301-C306 and C487-C645 form disulfide bonds in the absence of DTT (Dataset-1). However, in the presence of DTT (Dataset-2), chelated zinc ions are present and in the same location as that observe in SARS-CoV ( fig. S3B) . We reasoned the different purification buffer has led to this variation.",

S7 ), a model of 2019-nCoV nsp12 with remdesivir diphosphate is proposed (Fig. 4) . In 2019-nCoV nsp12, the 2' hydroxyl of the incoming NTP is likely to form hydrogen bonds with T680 and N691 in motif B (Figs. 4, A and B). In addition, D623 in motif A is positioned to interrogate the 3' hydroxyl through hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the hydrophobic side chain of V557 in motif F is likely to stack with 5 and stabilize the +1 template RNA uridine base to base pair with the incoming triphosphate remdesivir (ppp-remdesivir). In the structures of HCV ns5b elongation complex or its complex with pp-sofosbuvir, a key feature is that the incorporated pp-sofosbuvir disrupts the hydrogen bonding network between S282 and D225 (Figs. 4, C and D), which is necessary to stabilize the incoming natural nucleotide (12). However, key contacts formed by S282 with the incoming nucleotide and the surrounding environment can result in an S\u2192T resistance mutation that is already observed in the clinic (17). In the structure of apo 2019-nCoV nsp12, the orientation of S682 and D623, which are strictly conserved with S282 and D225 in HCV ns5b, is similar to that observed in the HCV ns5b-pp-sofosbuvir complex, indicating a different recognition mechanism with that inhibitor. Nevertheless, the close distance of S682 with the incoming ppp-remdesivir and 15 the environment surrounding the inhibitor alters the appearance of a drug-resistant mutation associated with remdesivir treatments.",

After the OD600 reached 0.8, the culture was cooled to 16 \u00b0C and supplemented with 0.5 mM IPTG. After overnight induction, the cells were harvested through centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl, 10 10% glycerol) and homogenized with an ultra-high-pressure cell disrupter at 4 \u00b0C. The insoluble material was removed through centrifugation at 12,000 rpm. The fusion protein was first purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and elution with lysis buffer and then further purified by passage through a Hitrap Q ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare, USA) before loading onto a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-",
