In the range of very rare target (<0.05), this approach can reduce the number of necessary tests dramatically, for example, achieving a reduction by a factor of 50 for a target frequency of 0.001. The second method is a simpler approach of optimized one-time pooling followed by individual tests on positive pools.

In regions and testing conditions in which positive tests are very rare (p<0.05), a strategy of repeated pooling can be extremely efficient by first selecting an initial batch size that yields probability 0.5 of being entirely negative, and then proceeding by positive batches in half at each stage. As mentioned above, when positive samples are exceedingly rare this strategy in principle calls for very large batch sizes, well into the hundreds and even thousands. Such large batches are unfeasible with existing protocols. However, as we have shown, the strategy of repeated pooling is highly efficient in settings of exceedingly rare positives even when batch size is constrained to a pragmatic limit such as 64. Nevertheless, the process of repeatedly splitting pools into two may be challenging for many laboratories to implement in practice, and it loses marginal efficiency as the frequency of positive tests increases. We therefore show that a simpler protocol of one-time pooling, with optimized initial batch sizes is very efficient for all p up to about 0.2. One-time pooling is efficient even when the size of possible initial batch sizes is technically limited, for example to 16, either in order to simplify laboratory protocol or because knowledge of p is lacking. We show that both methods compare favorably to fixed-size matrix methods, that attempt to exploit 2D positional information from samples arranged on a grid. We note, however, that matrix methods can in principle also be optimized for given p, or by using complex pooling strategies 10 . Optimized matrix methods may prove more efficient than the two straight-forward methods presented here.",

On the other hand, as of March 31 st , there had been 956,481 tests performed in the US, with 162,399 positives, a rate of p=0.17, more than four times higher 7 . These rates additionally vary across cities and regions, and also change over time. Expanding testing to surveys in asymptomatic populations is expected to significantly reduce the typical values of p.

It is simply calculated as follows: p = (number of positive samples)/ (number of all tested samples). \u2022 Next, identify the initial batch size from the tables below, by finding the appropriate range of p. Each laboratory should ignore ranges (i.e. rows) associated with batch sizes larger than the laboratory's chosen maximum, and in cases where p is estimated in those ranges simply choose the maximal batch-size. For example, a protocol of onetime pooling with maximal batch size of 16 would set an initial batch size of 4 for p>0.04, a batch size of 8 for p between 0.008 and 0.04, and a batch size of 16 for all p<0.008.",
