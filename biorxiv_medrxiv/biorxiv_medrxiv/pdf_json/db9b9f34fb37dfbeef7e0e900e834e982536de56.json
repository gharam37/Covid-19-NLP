The authors report that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) had significant virus reducing effects, and that dual treatment of both HCQ and azithromycin further enhanced virus reduction. These data have triggered speculation whether these drugs should be considered as candidates for the treatment of severe COVID-19. However, questions have been raised regarding the study's data integrity, statistical analyses, and experimental design. We therefore reanalysed the original data to interrogate the main claims of the paper. Here we apply Bayesian statistics to assess the robustness of the original paper's claims by testing four variants of the data: 1) The",

Statistical evidence for the positive effect model ranged from strong for the original data (BF +0 ~11), to moderate when including patients who deteriorated (BF +0 ~4.35), to anecdotal when excluding untested patients (BF +0 ~2), and to anecdotal negative evidence if untested patients were assumed positive (BF +0 ~0.6). To assess whether HCQ is more effective when combined with AZ, we performed the same tests, and found only anecdotal evidence for the positive effect model for the original data (BF +0 ~2.8), and moderate evidence for all other variants of the data (BF +0 ~5.6). Our analyses only explore the effects of different assumptions about excluded and untested patients. These assumptions are not adequately reported, nor are they justified in the original paper, and we find that varying them causes substantive changes to the evidential support for the main claims of the original paper. This statistical uncertainty is exacerbated by the fact that the treatments were not randomised, and subject to several confounding variables including the patients consent to treatment, different care centres, and clinical decision-making. Furthermore, while the viral load measurements were noisy, showing multiple reversals between test outcomes, there is greater certainty around other clinical outcomes such as the 4 patients who seriously deteriorated. The fact that all of these belonged to the HCQ group should be assigned greater weight when evaluating the potential clinical efficacy of HCQ. Randomised controlled trials are currently underway, and will be critical in resolving this uncertainty as to whether HCQ and AZ are effective as a treatment for COVID-19.",

For Bayes factors below 1, the reciprocal can be taken to obtain the strength of evidence in the opposite direction. Our initial analyses attempted to reproduce the findings of the original paper using the same data. We then performed the same analyses again, but with modified assumptions for how to treat excluded patients and untested patients.

One patient died, three deteriorated into intensive care, one patient stopped because of nausea and one left the hospital. These can be considered counterfactual cases that are necessary to entertain for a conservative estimate of the effects of HCQ mono . In the following, we add the patients who died or entered intensive care to the positive test cases for day 6. This is tabulated in Fig. 1a . We exclude both the patient that stopped treatment due to nausea, and the one patient who left the hospital, due to the ambiguity of their cases.

On day 6 there were 5 patients who were untested, even though the day 6 test outcome was the primary outcome. The untested patients were assumed to be positive in the original paper, and for this data variant we simply exclude them. This can be motivated by the fact that the tests have some level of stochasticity, as can be seen from the fact that there are a total of 9 transitions from negative tests on a given day, followed by positive tests the next day. For 3 of the 5 patients, they tested positive on day 5, and for 2 of the patients the tests were not performed either on day 4 or day 5. Hence it is not known with any certainty what the test outcomes would have been in the five untested patients had they been tested on day 6. This is especially problematic since all 5 of these untested patients belonged to the comparison group. For this reason it is important to analyse data that excludes these untested patients.",

Using a complementary (Bayesian) statistical framework, we evaluated the strength of the statistical evidence for the main claims of Gautret et al., and we asked how robust this evidence is to different assumptions about how to treat deteriorated and untested patients. Though we were able to qualitatively reproduce a positive effect of HCQ on viral load reduction, and a further improvement by adding AZ, the strength of the evidence was highly sensitive to variations in these assumptions. We discussed these in detail, and provided a broader context for evaluating the quality of evidence offered by the original paper. In the original paper, the main test for the effect of HCQ was performed by comparing a group of two different treatments (monotherapy HCQ mono and the combination therapy HCQ +AZ ) against the comparison group. This test does not directly answer the question of what is the clinical effect of HCQ on upper respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 viral load reduction, and to answer this one needs to compute the effect of HCQ mono against the comparison group. It is regrettable that this test was not reported because it is the test that is necessary to evaluate the effect of HCQ on viral reduction. Performing a Bayesian A/B test, we found that for the original data, there was strong statistical evidence for the positive effect of HCQ mono improving the chances of viral reduction when compared to the comparison group. However, we found that the level of evidence drops down to moderate evidence when including the deteriorated patients, and it drops further to anecdotal evidence when excluding the patients that were not tested on the day of the primary outcome (day 6). For context, anecdotal evidence is generally considered 'barely worth mentioning' (Jeffreys, 1961) .",

It should be noted that this test is not the most relevant test because it varies two drugs at the same time. Nevertheless, the statistical evidence for the positive effect of the combined treatment over no treatment is very strong for the original data, and drops down to moderate when excluding the untested patients (Fig. 3) .",

            "text": "Furthermore, this uncertainty is generally reflected in the credibility interval estimates for the odds ratios, which can range from moderate decreases or small increases in the chances of improvement, through to very large chances of improvement. These uncertainties stem from the small sample sizes for each subgroup. Indeed, the original paper has been criticised for being underpowered due to its relatively small sample size (16 comparison group, 20 treated). However, we argue that, from the perspective of statistical evidence, this criticism is less relevant once the data are observed. Firstly such criticisms, though commonly espoused, should be made with reference to the effect size they are underpowered for. Small sample studies can be well powered for detecting large effect sizes. More importantly, although estimating power is useful in planning experiments, it can be misleading when making inferences from observed data (Wagenmakers et al. 2015) . In this reanalysis we rely on Bayes factors, which are an extension of likelihood ratios beyond point hypotheses. These methods of inference do not average over hypothetical replications of an experiment, but instead condition on the data that were actually observed. For instance, the fact that a small sample can reveal strong evidence for an effect indicates that the effect size could be relatively large. In this way, Bayes factors rationally quantify the evidence that a particular dataset provides for or against the null, or any other hypothesis. Recourse to claims about the power of an experiment can be displaced by considering the strength of the evidence for one model over other models. This is clinically important because the strength of this evidence is not apparent from the statistical reporting of the original paper (which only reported p-values). Put simply, the findings of the original paper cannot be dismissed solely on the basis of being \"underpowered\".",

For a full statistical review of these considerations see Dahler and colleagues 2020. Most importantly, the comparison between HCQ +AZ and HCQ mono is confounded by the unreported clinical reasons for which the physicians decided to add the AZ treatment to some patients but not to others. If these reasons were important enough to warrant different treatment, then they are important enough to impact on the comparability between the two groups. Whilst we refrain from making formal inferences, it is relevant to note that the HCQ group patients were older than the comparison group patients (median age 51.5 and 32.5 years respectively, Table 4 ). It is also worth mentioning, that the comparison group included five cases aged 16 or younger, which should again warrant caution when comparing outcomes between groups. We briefly comment on the existence of putative deviations from the pre-registered protocol, available at https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2020-000890-25/FR . Outcomes specified in advance included evaluation of upper respiratory tract viral carriage at 1,7, and 14 days, and yet the primary outcome reported in the paper was on day 6. This has been interpreted by some as outcome switching, however we would, in the absence of further information, suggest the possibility that this is an issue of how the days are numbered, whether one starts counting from zero or one.

Furthermore, a number of patients are later tested positive after being tested negative (occurring a total 9 times in 8 patients) which may further question the use of a hard threshold on the number of cycles. For these reasons using duplicate sample analysis and confirmatory tests and eventually developing quantitative PCR tests for assessment of treatment effects would be recommended for future studies. Also note, that the current recommendation for a FDA-emergency approved test is that negative PCR results do not 1 preclude presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and recommend that such results be accompanied by clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information. Finally, it is important to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleic acid detected by PCR is replication competent or not.
