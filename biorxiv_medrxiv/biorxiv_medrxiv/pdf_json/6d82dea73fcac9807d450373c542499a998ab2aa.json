To fulfill this need, theoretical modelling can play a crucial role. Traditional epidemiology models that assume universal or constant infection parameters are not sufficient to address case specific strategies like contact tracing. Therefore, we have developed an agent-based epidemiological model which takes into account that disease transmission happens in distinct arenas of social life that each have different role under lockdown: The family, the workplace, our social circles, and the public sphere. This subdivision becomes especially important when discussing such efforts as contact tracing. Using an estimated weight of social contacts within each of these four spheres 3 we discuss the effect of various mitigation strategies.",

First, how a lockdown is most effectively implemented, and second, how society is subsequently reopened safely, and yet as fast as possible. To answer the first, we must examine the relative effects of reducing the amount of contacts in the workplace, in public spaces, and in closely connected groups of friends. For the second question, we will look for viable strategies for mitigation that do not require a total lockdown. Here, we will especially focus on the testing efficiency, contact tracing 11 , and improved hygiene. Our results will hopefully be helpful in Figure 1 . A diagram of the model structure. Each agent has a network consisting of a family, a workplace and two groups of friends. The family accounts for 40 % of interactions. Work accounts for 30 % and socialisation with friends accounts for a further 15 %. These contacts in each of these 3 groups are fixed throughout the simulation. Finally, 15 % of interactions happen \"in public\", which we implement as an interaction with a randomly chosen other agent. Everyone in the work and friend sub-graphs are assumed to be connected to each other. Below the graph, the underlying mechanisms of the disease are shown. We divide the exposed state into four in order to get a more naturalistic distribution of incubation periods. In our simulation we set the family groups to 2, the work network to 10 completely interconnected people and the friend network consist of 2 groups with 5 in each.

(a) Comparison of various strategies with and without a reduction in transmission probability per encounter. It can be seen that work and social contacts play roughly the same part in disease transmission. A reduction of infection probability makes the strategies relatively more effective. Reducing work contacts, for example, reduces the peak height by roughly 20 % (relative to no intervention) if infection probability is high. If the infection probability is lowered, the strategy causes a 36 % decrease in peak height (relative to only reducing infection probability). (b) A similar comparison of the effects of reducing workplace sizes by half. This strategy is also relatively more effective if infection probability is reduced. The strategy reduces peak height by 28 % at a lowered infection probability versus only 12 % if infection probability remains high.",

Therefore, we will here implement a crude form of contact tracing where we 1) close the workplaces of people who are tested positive for the disease, 2) isolate their regular social contacts for a limited period, and 3) test people for COVID-19 just before they exit the quarantine. We will see that such a 1 step tracing and quarantine strategy (1STQ) can give a sizeable reduction in disease spread while costing fewer lost workdays than overall lockdown. Our simulations include the limitations imposed by not being able to trace the estimated 15% of infections from random public transmissions. Thus the strategy does not require sophisticated contact tracing but could be implemented based on infected people being able to recollect their recent physical encounters with friends. It should be noted that we here quarantine persons in their own households, thereby making our contact tracing strategy easier to implement in practice. In particular, family members of a quarantined person are still free to interact outside their home if they are not themselves tested positive. The drawback of such light quarantine practices is that infected persons in quarantine may still transmit the infection to their families. Fig. 3 (a,b,c) examines how increased detection efficiency systematically improves our ability to reduce the peak disease burden. This would then be a more cost efficient way to mitigate the pandemic than a complete lockdown where each person would lose several man-months. Even detecting as little as 2 % of COVID-19 infected per day (which with an average disease duration of 5 days corresponds to finding approximately 10 % of the infected) can potentially reduce the peak number of cases by 30 % . If 10 % efficiency is possible, corresponding to detecting about half of infectious cases, then peak height could be reduced by a factor 3, and with less than 12 quarantine days per person during the entire epidemic. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 (b) where peak height is reduced from 0.27 to 0.08 at 10 % testing efficiency. In supplement Figs. S4,5 one can compare this with the simpler strategy where only the infected person and their family are quarantined. The peak height is reduced, but only from 0.27 to 0.20 at 10 %/day testing efficiency.",

As a consequence, an average person will stay around 5 days in quarantine during the course of the epidemics with a testing efficiency of 2 % . This time can be reduced if people can convinced of smaller work environments and fewer physical contact per week.

The main points of the present analysis is the focus on mitigating instead of controlling the epidemic, on our suggestion of a finite quarantine length, and that our approach implements quarantine together with other members of the household instead of total isolation. Our stochastic approach also allow for local failures due to the limited duration of quarantine (people may not yet be infectious when exiting quarantine) and the non traceable public contacts (set to 15%).",

In the supplement we analyse a model of COVID-19 with pre-symptomatic transmission. This leads to a shorter serial interval and a smaller R 0 when infection is adjusted to an observed growth of 23 % per day for the epidemic. Even with massive pre-symptomatic transmission (infectious already 2.4 days before onset) our approach still works quite well. At 30 % detection efficiency per infected individual (10 % per day in Fig. S2 (c)) our 1STQ strategy reduces the peak epidemic from 0.14 \u2192 0.08. This should be compared to a reduction from 0.27 \u2192 0.10 when the disease has no asymptomatic cases but a correspondingly larger R 0 (compare with the effect at 6 % per day in Fig. 3(c) ).",

Methods for implementing this in practice could include wearing masks, practicing good hygiene, and keeping a distance even to coworkers and friends. Our study shows that lockdowns and contact tracing have an impact, but that they should not stand alone.",

Due to the uncertainties caused by a situation in flux, it is difficult to predict anything definite about what works and what does not. The empirical observation that lockdowns worked in both China, and in a milder form in Denmark shows that our use of 75 % reduction in specific infection rates under lockdown is realistic. Our main result is that some of these restrictions can be replaced by testing, 1 step contact tracing and short periods of quarantine. This is far cheaper than total lockdowns. The measures can even work when implemented late in the epidemic. Perhaps most importantly, these measures work best in combination. As is highly relevant to the current epidemic stage of COVID-19, we pinpoint that 1STQ can be successfully implemented also at a late stage of the epidemic where testing may become massively available.",

The total height of the curve shows the combined fraction of people who are ill or in quarantine. (c) and (d) show the peak fraction of population infected (left y-axis) and time spent in quarantine (right y-axis) as a function of testing chance and quarantine length. The number of days in quarantine was calculated using our standard group sizes which connect each person to approximately 20 others. The average quarantine time scales proportionally with this assumed connectivity. (c) With a quarantine length of 5 days, it is possible to reduce the peak number of infected by almost ten percentage points, corresponding to a 30 % drop, if the probability of infected people being tested is only 2 % per day of illness.",

(c) shows the peak number of infected and average number of days each person spends in quarantine as a function of daily testing probability.
