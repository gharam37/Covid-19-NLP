Early studies suggest that peak viral load 26 differentiates mild from severe COVID-19 10 .Furthermore, viral load monitoring during antiviral 27 therapy is a mainstay for various human infections including HIV, hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus 28 and hepatitis C infections [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .

Currently licensed flocked swabs may not be optimal for patients with vulnerable 51 mucosal membranes and low platelet counts (e.g. following cytotoxic chemotherapy) because 52 they are associated with some discomfort and possible bleeding. Moreover, their general level 53 of discomfort may deter participants from collecting longitudinal samples. This may limit 54 widespread use for self-testing, especially as surveillance testing or for use in vulnerable 55 patients or children. Importantly, a reliable and comfortable home-based self-testing 56 methodology is needed to prevent potentially infected individuals from entering healthcare 57 facilities to be tested and transmitting virus to healthcare workers and other patients.

Serial home-based testing appears to be a well-accepted methodology. 114 115 Steady-state nasal passage viral load kinetics during respiratory virus infections. In the 116 longitudinal sampling portion of our study, we were able to detect 14 viruses including seven 117 human rhinovirus (HRV), two coronavirus (CoV), one bocavirus (BoV), two adenovirus (ADV), 118 one human metapneumovirus (MPV) and one respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases. There 119 were four instances of viral co-infection, though in each case a dominant virus was evident 120 based on greater duration of shedding and higher viral load (Fig 2a) . 121 122 Duration of shedding was heterogeneous. In 5 cases, HRV shedding lasted more than a week 123 with one instance of 5-day shedding and one short single-day blip. RSV and MPV episodes 124 were both prolonged. ADV, BoV and CoV shedding was short-lived, though in one case low-125 level ADV shedding was evident throughout the sampling period (Fig 2a) . 126 127 During most extended periods of HRV, RSV and HMPV shedding, viral loads were remarkably 128 stable from sample to sample (Fig 2a) . For HRV, a generalized pattern of viral load steady state 129 or slight gradual decline, followed by rapid elimination was noted. The single case of RSV had a 130 similar profile but with an initial high viral load peak and shorter duration of shedding. The single 131 case of MPV had a more protracted decline with a single re-expansion phase. These transiently 132 observed periods of steady state viral loads are highly unlikely to occur by chance if true viral 133 loads fluctuated or exhibited stochastic noise. Thus, the sampling method appears highly 134 reliable. These data also suggest a brief period of equilibrium between the virus and local 135 immune system before viral elimination. 136 137 .

These results have enormous practical implications. Self-collection at 241 home is safe, non-invasive and easily learned, allowing a reliable method for diagnosis as well 242 as therapeutic monitoring. Because our kits could easily be used at home or in a drive through 243 testing environment, they provide an avenue to eliminate contact between an infected and 244 contagious person, and health care providers. They could also be used in the hospital or clinic 245 setting, thereby saving personnel time and personal protective equipment. The use of 246 comfortable, safe and affordable foam swabs also highlights the possibility of scaling this 247 approach to pediatric, adult, elderly and immunocompromised populations. For the current 248 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and future deadly respiratory virus epidemics, home self-swabbing will 249 be a vital tool. Additional anatomical sites have also been considered for increasing yield, and current FDA 261 recommendations suggest use of both a mid-turbinate nasal swab and an oropharyngeal swab 262 to maximize yield in the absence of nasopharyngeal swabbing 23 . Our prior data demonstrate 263 that self-collected throat swabs in addition to self-collected foam nasal swabs do not increase 264 yield significantly for respiratory viruses 26 , suggesting that additional oral swabbing may not be 265 needed, especially in the setting of swab shortages.

It is increasingly recognized that tissue 34 resident T-cells and antigen presenting cells are phenotypically and functionally distinct from 35 circulating immune cells, especially in the setting of respiratory viral infections 18-20 . Therefore, 36 measuring immune cells in blood can fundamentally misclassify the agents responsible for viral 37 elimination at the local level. To assess tissue resident immune cells requires biopsies which 38 are difficult to obtain during active infection. Yet, important shifts in the immune response 39 against respiratory viruses likely occur rapidly and in stages during the early and late phases of 40 viral shedding 21 . Serial measurement of local cytokines may provide a window into the local 41 cellular response 22 , but has yet to be validated from longitudinal clinical samples. 42 43 Self-testing for respiratory viruses has been promoted for more than a decade and successfully 44 performed both in research and primary care settings, but regulatory agencies have been slow 45 to accept patient collected samples as valid, especially in the home setting. Recently issued 46 initial guidelines from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required 47 nasopharyngeal (NP) sampling using flocked swabs for diagnosis of COVID-19 by clinical 48 laboratories 23 . However, as the demand for testing exponentially increases, NP swab availability 49 significantly hampers effective and efficient testing and identification of COVID-19-infected 50",

On the other hand, small molecules associated 295 specifically with tissue-resident T cell responses such as granzyme B, perforin and IFN\u03b3, and 296 macrophages such as IL-6 and IL-1 expand and contract during the course of viral shedding, 297 particularly with more severe infections such as RSV and HPMV. Our technique therefore 298 overcomes a fundamental limitation of human immunological studies, which is the inability to 299 sample over temporally granular time intervals at the mucosal site of viral replication. 300 301 Further validation of our technique is demonstrated with mathematical modeling that links 302 expression of certain cytokines with early and late elimination of virus. For RSV and MPV, we 303 demonstrate that an early surge in IFN\u03b3 is coupled with elimination of a massive number of 304 infected cells but is insufficient for complete containment of infection, which is achieved several 305 days later concurrent with slower expansion IL-21. Notably, IL-21 has previously been identified 306 as required for RSV elimination in murine models 29-31 In our model, it induces an extremely high 307 death rate of infected cells once above a certain concentration. Larger scale studies may be 308 able to link surges in different cytokines with different respiratory viruses, including SARS CoV-309 2, and to differentiate severity using these techniques. Of particular interest is combining 310 information on levels of local cytokine levels with viral load at presentation, along with patient 311 metadata, to predict infection severity. 312 313 There are important limitations to our study. Correlations between foam and flocked swabs were 314 weaker at low viral loads. However, stochastic variation in low viral load samples is inherent to 315 quantitation of viruses which replicate in mucosa. Additional variables such as storage 316 temperature may have contributed to viral quantification variability.

The 440 impact of host immunity is tracked by modeling two cytokines that are plausible surrogates for 441 those responses. We assumed RSV-infected cells (I) are cleared by: (1) an innate response 442 with rate mediated by an innate immune response tracked by an initial cytokine (G); and (2) 443 an acquired response with rate + mediated by an acquired immune response tracked by a 444 second cytokine (C). The Hill coefficient parameterizes the nonlinearity of the response and 445 allows for rapid saturation of the killing.
