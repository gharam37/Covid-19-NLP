For cellular entry, SARS-CoV-2 relies on the interaction of its glycosylated viral spike (S) protein with the host membrane-bound aminopeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Subsequently, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) cleaves S and/or ACE2 protein, which facilitates the fusion of viral and cellular membranes 2 . ACE2 is also a crucial component of RAS, which regulates several key physiological processes such as blood pressure and electrolyte balance and viral infection of ACE2-expressing cells may impair RAS function 3 .",

Subsequently, Ang I is processed to the 8-aa Ang II by the metallopeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) present on the surface of pulmonary and kidney endothelial cells. Ang II is the active peptide in RAS triggering vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and fibrosis and signals by binding to its receptor AGTR1 or AT1R. ACE2, a metallopeptidase paralogous to ACE, counters the activity of ACE by digesting Ang II to the 7 aa Ang-(1-7) form, thereby attenuating the effects of Ang II 3 . Ang-(1-7) signals through binding to the G-protein coupled receptor MAS1 as well as the receptor AGTR2 or AT2R.

In adult lung, alveolar type 1 and 2, as well as ciliated epithelial cells co-expressed ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with highest expression in alveolar type 2 cells. In the kidney, we found that proximal tubular cells and tubular progenitor cells co-expressed ACE2 and TMPRSS2. In the gastrointestinal tract, epithelial cells of the esophagus, rectum, colon, and ileum also co-expressed ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Furthermore, lung epithelial cell types additionally co-expressed ACE, AGTR1, and AGTR2, whereas kidney proximal tubular cells co-expressed ACE and AGTR1, but not AGTR2. Enterocytes of the gastrointestinal tract co-expressed ACE but only minimally either of AGTR1 or AGTR2.

For other tissues such as adult lung, esophagus, and spleen published R object containing metadata and raw counts were obtained 5 . We recently published fetal heart 8 , skin 9 , and first-trimester placenta and decidua 10 scRNA-seq data and it was used for generating averaged expression profiles for cell types. Next, we used in-house generated and unpublished scRNA-seq data from tissues of donor and allograft kidney, and testis. After averaged expression profiles for cell types were generated, the expression was normalized to a million to generate transcript per million (TPM) values, followed by transformation to log2(TPM+1) for representing the gene expression in Fig. 1. author/funder.

            "text": ". The trophoblasts of first-trimester placenta (6-11 weeks of gestation) showed presence of ACE2 in syncytiotrophoblasts (SCTs) that form the outer layer of villous projections and the villous cytotrophoblasts (VCTs) located in the innermost chorionic villi layer while TMPRSS2 was restricted to the VCTs only. In addition, both SCTs and VCTs expressed AGTR1 but not ACE, AGTR2, or MAS1. Most strikingly, the first-trimester decidua, unlike other tissues, showed high ACE2 expression in stromal cells but lacked TMPRSS2 expression, which was largely restricted to the epithelial cells. Vascular endothelial cells of the first-trimester decidua, in addition to ACE2, expressed ACE and AGTR1 but not AGTR2, overall emphasizing the complex distribution of RAS components at the maternal-fetal interface. The cell-type-resolved expression pattern of ACE2 suggests the possibility of direct involvement of organs other than airways and lung in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Acute gastrointestinal injury in critically ill patients and detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool samples 14 , points towards viral infection of epithelial cell types showing abundant expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in colon, Ileum and rectum. Inflammation and myocardial injury is also associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19 15 . Expression of ACE2 in cardiomyocytes suggests the potential for direct infection of the virus in the heart. In the kidney, abundant ACE2 and TMPRSS2 coexpression in proximal tubular and progenitor cells also makes them potential targets of virus",

This observation is crucial in the context of understanding whether the virus can be vertically transmitted from pregnant mother to the fetus. Such phenomenon remains controversial in absence of concrete evidence 18-20 . Co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in Sertoli, Leydig and germ cells indicate potential pathogenicity to the testicular tissue. Interestingly, although viral RNA has been detected in several clinical specimens (termed 'RNAaemia' in absence of tests for presence of infectious viral particles) in the majority of infected patients, infectious virus particles have not been yet recovered from urine or blood of COVID-19",

            "text": ". The predominant epithelial cell distribution of ACE and ACE2 observed in multiple tissues is indicative of the presence of organcentric RAS as opposed to the circulating RAS 23 . The discordance in the distribution of AGTR1 and AGTR2, as well as of MAS1, raises the intriguing possibility that additional receptors and downstream signaling pathways may be involved in RAS. Our finding of minimal expression of ACE2 in the vascular endothelial cells questions a role for Ang (1-7) as counterregulatory hormone of circulating RAS in attenuating the effects of Ang II 3 . Our analysis provides an important resource by highlighting cell types targetable by SARS-CoV-2 and towards understanding the tissue-wide expression of RAS components and its possible alterations in the context of COVID-19.",
