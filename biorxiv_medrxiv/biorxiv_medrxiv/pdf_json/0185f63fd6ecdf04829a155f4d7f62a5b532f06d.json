Mathematical models are widely used in evaluating epidemic transmissions, forecasting the trend of disease spread, and providing optimal intervention strategies and control measures. A considerable number of recent studies have contended to estimate the scale and severity of COVID-19, and several mathematical models and predicting approaches have attempted to estimate the transmission of COVID-19 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The majority of the studies have estimated the basic reproductive number R 0 , a key parameter to evaluate the potential for COVID-19 transmission. However, different models often yield different conclusions in terms of differences in model structure and input parameters. It is imperative and critical to improve the early predictive and warning capabilities of potential models for the pandemic.",

Mathematically, the logistic model describes the dynamic evolution of infected individuals being controlled by the growth rate and population capacity. According to the following ordinary differential equation (a), we will obtain the logistic function (b). The model describes the dynamic evolution of the reported number of confirmed cases P being controlled by the growth rate r, and the initial value of P 0 is the confirmed number of cases when T=0. The maximum case volume in the environment is K, which is the limit that can be reached by increasing to the final value of P \u123a t \u123b , and r is the growth rate. We used the least squares method to fit the logistic growth function and then to predict the number of future confirmed cases. Since the case numbers reported at very early stages are usually inaccurate or missing, the initial date of the model was set as the day since the 100th confirmed case was reached.",

However, as the epidemic curve follows the rule of rising, peaking, and then declining, during our observed period, all 8 countries are in their speedy rising stages but have not yet reached their peak and decline stages. Among these countries, the number of confirmed patients in Italy is the largest. After a small burst, as a result of a series of emergency prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed diagnoses in South Korea has increased slowly. Iran, Germany, Spain and the US have approximately 20,000 confirmed patients as of March 20, and there are no trends of a slowdown. Iran has more mild patients, so cure rates are higher. The confirmed cumulative number of patients in Japan is 963 as of March 20, and the number of cured patients is 191, which is the smallest number of cases in these 8 countries.",
