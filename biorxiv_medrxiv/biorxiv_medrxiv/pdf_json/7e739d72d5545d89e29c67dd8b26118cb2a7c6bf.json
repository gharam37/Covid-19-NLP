Knowledge, attitude, and practice survey provides a suitable format to evaluate existing programs and to identify effective strategies for behavior change in society. Therefore, the aim of study is to assess knowledge, attitude and practice among HCPs in Pakistan regarding COVID-19. An online survey-based study was conducted among healthcare professionals including physicians, pharmacists and nurses. A self-administered validated (Cronbach alpha= 0.077) questionnaire comprised of five sections (Demographics, Knowledge, attitude, practice and perceived barriers) were used for data collection. Of 414 participants, 29.98% (n=120) physicians, 46.65% (n= 189) pharmacists and 25.36% (n= 105%) nurses. Most commonly utilized information source was social media. Findings showed HCPs have good knowledge (93.2%, n=386), positive attitude (8.43\u00b11.78) and good practice (88.7%, n=367) regarding COVID-19. HCPs perceived that overcrowding in emergency room (52.9%, n=219), limited infection control material (50.7%, n=210) and poor knowledge regarding transmission (40.6%, n=168) of COVID-19 are the major barriers in infection control practice. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that HCPs of age group 40-49 years (OR: 1.419, 95%CI: (0.14-4.78, P=0.041) have higher odds of good knowledge. Similarly, age group of 31-39 years (OR: 1.377, 95% CI: 0.14-2.04, P=0.05), experience of more than 5 years (OR: 10.71, 95% CI: 2.83-40.75, P<0.001), and pharmacist job (OR: 2.247, 95% CI: 1.11-4.55, P=0.025) were the substantial determinants of good practice regarding COVID-19. HCPs in Pakistan have good knowledge, yet, there are areas where gaps in knowledge and practice was observed. To effectively control infection spread, well-structured .",

The pathogen identified was named as novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), currently called as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), an enveloped and single stranded RNA virus [2] which has phylogenetic resemblance to SARS-COV-1 [3] . Owing to rapid spread of this deadly virus from epicenter to number of countries, WHO declared it as public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. Later, due to uncased fast spread, severity of illness, the continual escalation in number of affected countries, cases and causalities, WHO declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic on 11 March 2020 [4] . To date (12 April, 2020), the COVID-19 have spread to 210 countries and territories accounted for 1,790,550 laboratory confirmed cases and 109,654 mortalities also attributed to this deadly pathogen [5] .",

This proportion (20%) is higher than other study that stated only 9.1% respondents have answered that flu vaccine could provide protection against COVID-19 [10].

It is therefore necessary that these aspects of COVID-19 should be uncovered and cleared to HCPs so that they can educate people to counter this global public health issue.

COVID-19 has posed serious occupational health risk to the HCP owing to their frequent exposure to infected individuals [11]. Protection of HCPs and prevention of intra-hospital transmission of infection are important aspects in epidemic response and this requires that HCPs must have updated knowledge regarding source, transmission, symptoms and preventive measures [12]. Literature suggest that lack of knowledge and misunderstandings among HCPs leads to delayed diagnosis, spread of disease and poor infection control practice [13]. Several thousand healthcare workers have already been infected, mainly in China [11]. In Pakistan, number of HCPs (15 medics in Multan, 17 doctors & 5 paramedics in Quetta, 16 medics in KP, 4 doctors & 1 paramedics in Karachi) are infected of COVID-19 [14,15] while unfortunately three doctors [16] and 1 nurse was died of COVID-19 [17]. Preventing intrahospital transmission of the communicable disease is therefore a priority.",

Total score ranges from 0-14 and a cut off level of \u226410 was set for poor knowledge and \u226511 for good knowledge. Attitude section comprised of 7 items and response of each item was recorded on 5-point Likert scale as follows strongly agree (1-point), agree (2-point), Undecided (3-point), disagree (4-point), and strongly disagree (5-point). Total score ranges from 7 to 35, with an overall lower mean score indicates positive attitude toward COVID-19. Practice section included 6 items and each item was responded as Yes (1-point), No (0-point), and Sometimes (0-point). Practice items total score ranged as 0-6, and a score of 5-6 demonstrated good practice and a score of 1-4 indicates poor practice toward precautionary measures of COVID-19.",

Current findings of good knowledge among HCPs is in line with findings of Giao et al who reported that 88.4% participants have sufficient knowledge regarding COVID-19 [22]. Shi et al also reported that 89.51% healthcare workers have claimed good knowledge while in another study conducted among nurses reported that 56.5% respondents have sufficient knowledge regarding transmission, symptoms and treatment of COVID-19 [12]. Present findings provide confidence in terms of healthcare professional's knowledge regarding COVID-19 symptoms, transmission and preventive measures. This is of more significance in current scenario when there is no vaccine and research is ongoing so HCPs must aware of all the updates and take precautions in treating and preventing the infection.",

Khan et al and Albarrak et al also found that allied health care workers including pharmacists have higher knowledge towards MERS compared to physicians [25,26]. While another study by Bhagavathula et al reported that physicians have higher knowledge compared to pharmacists [10]. Possible speculation could be that there are disparities of knowledge among HCPs. In addition to doctors, pharmacists also actively involved in seeking information owing to their active role in improving treatment outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Also, findings encourage a collaborative approach among different HCPs in relation to clinical decision making. Findings showed highly positive attitude among all the HCPs towards wearing gowns and in following other recommendations. Possible explanation is that good knowledge among HCPs might lead to positive attitude towards COVID-19. This is also augmented by positive linear correlation between knowledge and attitude found in present study. Giao et al and Bhagavathula et al also reported that majority of HCPs have positive attitude towards COVID-19 [10,22].",

While Albarrak et al and khan et al didn't found any difference in attitude towards MERS among doctors, pharmacists, and nurses (P>0.05) [25,26]. Results revealed that majority of HCPs have good practice in following precautionary measures. Highest (96.10%) good practice was observed in washing hands with soap which is similar to the findings of Nour et al and khan et al who reported 95.4% and 85.7% HCPs used to wash their hands continuously [25,27]. Findings indicated pharmacist have higher odds of showing good practice compared to other HCPs. Possible explanation is that pharmacist is an emerging profession especially in developing countries like Pakistan, and they are actively involved in educational and training activities to seek knowledge and made themselves competent enough to involve in clinical decision making with other HCPs [28,29]. Also, pharmacists are actively involved in counselling the patients which leads to positivity in their attitude and good practice. Regression analysis also indicated that experienced health care professionals have good practice in following guidelines recommendations especially wearing of face mask as it is evident that use of personal protective equipment might be helpful in reducing spread of virus in hospital and protect others from infection [30]. Therefore, it is important among different workers to adhere to the practice guidelines according to NIH and WHO intending the COVID-19 infection in the community. The study further recommends healthcare workers to reinforce their knowledge and attitude that will eventually translate into good practice. Findings demonstrated that majority of HCPs perceived that overcrowding of emergency department, limited infection control material and lack of knowledge regarding transmission of the major barriers in infection control practice. These findings are important and should be addressed by Government and policy makers to establish effective policies focusing aforementioned barriers to control infection and ultimately spread of disease.",
