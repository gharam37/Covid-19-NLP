While a large number of investigational as well as approved and repurposed drugs have been suggested to have utility for treatment of COVID-19, preclinical data from animal models can guide a more focused search for effective treatments in humans by ruling out treatments without proven efficacy in vivo. Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a nucleotide analog prodrug with broad antiviral activity 1 , including against coronaviruses 2 , that is currently investigated in COVID-19 clinical trials worldwide, including in China, the US and Europe (summarized in 3 ). In animal models, remdesivir treatment was effective against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection. 2, 4, 5 In vitro, remdesivir inhibited replication of SARS-CoV-2. 6, 7 Moreover, in vitro experiments have shown that mutations conferring resistance to remdesivir do not easily emerge in coronaviruses 8 . Here, we investigated the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in our recently established rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this model, infected rhesus macaques develop mild to moderate, transient respiratory disease with pulmonary infiltrates visible on radiographs, and a shedding pattern similar to that observed in COVID-19 patients 9 . Therapeutic treatment of rhesus macaques with remdesivir shortly before the peak of virus replication resulted in a significant clinical improvement, reduction in pulmonary infiltrates, and a reduction in pulmonary pathology.",

Twelve animals were randomly assigned to two groups and inoculated as described previously with a total dose of 2.6x10 6 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 strain nCoV-WA1-2020 via intranasal, oral, ocular and intratracheal routes. The efficacy of therapeutic remdesivir treatment was tested in two groups of six adult rhesus macaques (3 males and 3 females each; 3.6-5.7kg). Due to the acute nature of the SARS-CoV-2 model in rhesus macaques, therapeutic treatment was initiated at 12 hours after inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 and continued once daily through 6 days post inoculation (dpi). One group of rhesus macaques was treated with a loading dose of 10mg/kg remdesivir, followed by a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg. The other group of six animals served as infected controls and were administered an equal dose volume (i.e. 2 ml/kg loading dose and 1 ml/kg thereafter) of vehicle solution (12% sulfobutylether-\u03b2-cyclodextrin in water and hydrochloric acid, pH3.5) according to the same treatment schedule.

Briefly, 3 to 12 \u00b5l of extracted RNA was depleted of rRNA using Ribo-Zero Gold H/M/R (Illumina) and then reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and SuperScript IV (ThermoFisher Scientific). Following RNaseH treatment, second strand synthesis was performed using Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs) and resulting double-stranded cDNAs were treated with a combined mixture of RiboShredder RNase Blend (Lucigen) and RNase, DNase-free, high conc (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and then purified using Ampure XP bead purification (Beckman Coulter). Kapa's HyperPlus library preparation kit (Roche Sequencing Solutions) was used to prepare sequencing libraries from the doublestranded cDNAs. To facilitate multiplexing, adapter ligation was performed with KAPA Unique Dual-Indexed Adapters and samples were enriched for adapter-ligated product using KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready mix and 7 PCR amplification cycles, according to the manufacturer's manual. Pools consisting of eight sample libraries were used for hybrid-capture virus enrichment using myBaits\u00ae Expert Virus SARS-CoV-2 panel and following the manufacturer's manual, version 4.01, with 14 cycles of post-capture PCR amplification (Arbor Biosciences). Purified, enriched libraries were quantified using Kapa Library Quantification kit (Roche Sequencing Solutions) and sequenced as 2 X 150 base pair reads on the Illumina NextSeq 550 instrument (Illumina).",

This finding is of great significance for patient management, where a clinical improvement should not be interpreted as a lack of infectiousness. While our study demonstrates the presence of remdesivir metabolites in the lower respiratory tract, the drug levels in upper respiratory tract have not been characterized and novel formulations with alternative route of drug delivery should be considered to improve the distribution to the upper respiratory tract, thereby reducing shedding and the potential transmission risk. However, since severe COVID-19 disease is a result of virus infection of the lungs, this organ is the main target of remdesivir treatment. The bioavailability and protective effect of remdesivir in the lungs of infected rhesus macaques supports treatment of COVID-19 patients with remdesivir. Data from clinical trials in humans are pending, but our data in rhesus macaques indicate that remdesivir treatment should be considered as early as clinically possible to prevent progression to severe pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.",
