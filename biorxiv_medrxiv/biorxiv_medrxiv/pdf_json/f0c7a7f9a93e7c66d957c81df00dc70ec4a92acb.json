According to the information supplied by NHC and the Chinese CDC, the number of confirmed cases was 45 on Jan 16 2020, which increased to more than 80000 on Mar 5 2020. As the increasing rate of the active cases is close to 0 in March, it could be deduced that the epidemic situation is almost under control. However the epidemic situation in European countries was severe in March. As there was a relatively complete process from epidemic outbreak to control in China, it could supply a model by retrospective study. A mathematical model is proposed by modified susceptibleinfected-recovered (SIR) model, which for convenience is named as susceptible-infected-recovered-death (SIRD) model. The determination of parameters relies on case number data provided by the Chinese CDC which updates the number of active cases both in China and the global per day [7] and NHC which mainly updates the number of the active cases, the close contacts and the recovered cases in China [8] . Using the mathematical model proposed by the epidemic situation in China, the epidemic situation in European countries could also be estimated in the same way. The determination of the parameters in European countries relies on the data from Worldometer [6] . In this study 2 European countries Italy and Spain where the epidemic situation is quite severe are chosen .",

By retrospective study, it is found that the parameters are actually time-dependent. And the mortality may be an important variable during the outbreak of the disease.

The number of the active cases were the same as those in the previous simulation, the only change is the initial number of the susceptible population and the coefficient r 2 . It turns out that r 2 for European countries is still larger than that for China. It implies that the banning of transportation for China is more rigorous. Moreover, the initial number of the susceptible population is larger than that was reported regardless of the country due to lack of access to COVID-19 test kits in the early weeks.",

This might be demonstrated by the report that 60% of active cases might have no symptoms but could infect other healthy people [17] [18] [19] . And it is reported that the infected cases are of strong infection when they appeared to have no symptoms [24] . So when the first infected person appears in some area, the infected ones with no symptoms might convert the healthy people into the susceptible ones without records. In the hypothesised simulation, the actual data seemed to be closer to the simulated curves. But the increasing rate of the simulation is not as large as that in the observed data. The reason might be that the transportation control was not considered in this mechanism, which has already been mentioned in the previous section. This implies that banning of the traffic is an effective way to prevent the spreading of disease.",

The shape of its distribution function skew-right (skewness> 0), and the distribution function is \"thinner\" than normal distribution (kurtosis> 3). So the most probable number of r 1 is larger than 0.143. In this work we choose r 1 = 0.145. The detailed approach of determining the formula of the transmission rates would be shown in appendix. Similarly, the recovery parameter is also time-dependent. The details of determination of the time-dependent function of \u03b4(t) and \u00b5(t) are shown in appendix.

And most of the confirmed cases are in Hubei province. This is the result of the policies that confining the migration of the people during the outbreak of the COVID-19. The tendency of the death in Hubei province is consistent with the death in mainland China (figure 3) The red points are the death coefficients in Hubei province and the dark blue points are the death coefficients in China Figure 3 implies that the evolution of the SIRD model might show the same results in Hubei province.And it could be deduced that if the epidemic situation shows the outbreak, the tendency of the death coefficients are the same in both China and Hubei province China. As lack of experience and medical resources at the beginning, he death coefficient might be high. Then the death coefficient tends to a stable constant.Lack of medical resources is also reflected in European countries. Comparing with the case in China, it might be more severe in European countries. The death rate of Italy and Spain is estimated as in the formula(7). It is obvious that the death rate is larger in European countries than in China. The fitting line is shown in figures 4(a)-4(b)",

As the number of the susceptible population is changeable because of the number of the active cases, and it is not important in this study, it is not shown independently in figure 5. R(t) is the brown dashed line infigure 5(a). The reason why it is much larger than the active cases is that the number might be recounted.
