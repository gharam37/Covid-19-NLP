Ours is not an epidemiological model, in the sense that we do not try to model disease transmission, nor do we use or attempt to estimate underlying epidemiological parameters like the basic reproductive rate or attack rate. Rather, our model is purely statistical: we are fitting a curve and a probabilistic error model to observed death rates in a state, and we are extrapolating from that curve. The advantage of this approach is that it does not require estimates of critical epidemiological parameters, some of which remain elusive. The disadvantage is that it cannot project longer-term epidemiological dynamics beyond the initial wave of mitigated transmission. For this reason, we do not use the model to make projections beyond a moderate (2-3 week) horizon.",

This approximation is local in the sense that the curve's three parameters are allowed to evolve in time as a function of state-level covariates. Just as in the IHME model, this results in fitted death-rate curves that, when plotted over time, can differ substantially from the shape of a single Gaussian. While epidemic curves do not resemble Gaussian curves, time-evolving Gaussian curves do provide a good fit to observed COVID-19 state-level death rates.",

The strength of this approach is that it can leverage readily available data on social distancing without requiring a mechanistic transmission model.

We use data on Americans' actual social-distancing behavior, derived from GPS traces from tens of millions of mobile phones across the country. This data source quantifies two main types of distancing behavior: 1) changes in visitation patterns to public places like restaurants, bars, schools, parks, pharmacies, grocery stores, etc.; and 2) time spent at home versus at work. The IHME model, by contrast, uses a much coarser measure of social distancing: the timing of state-level policy implementations like school closures and stay-at-home orders. But the mobile-phone data reveals substantial differences among states in the timing and extent of peoples' actual distancing behavior, even for states with nominally similar policies. In Texas, for example, many large cities issued their own stay-at-home orders before the state did, affecting the movement patterns of many millions of people days before a statewide policy was in place-a fact that is clearly visible in the data. Our measures capture this substantial state-level and temporal variation that is obscured by regressing only on policies.",

For a variety of reasons, we find this assumption problematic. Our forecasts therefore rely solely on U.S. data, with state-level parameters shrunk toward a common mean in a hierarchical Bayesian model. Difference 3: valid uncertainty quantification. We address a problem with the IHME model by relying on a fundamentally different statistical assumption about model errors. Briefly: the IHME model fits cumulative death rates using a least-squares-like procedure on the log scale and applying standard large-sample statistical theory to get confidence intervals. For this procedure to result in valid uncertainty quantification, one must assume that successive model errors are independent. But in the IHME fitting procedure, this assumption is violated: today's cumulative death rate is yesterday's plus an increment, so the two must be correlated. Our model repairs this problem by fitting daily (noncumulative) death rates using a mixed-effects negative-binomial generalized linear model.",

We use weakly informative priors on the fixed effects \u03b2, the second-stage regression coefficients \u0393, and the covariance matrix \u03a3 of the random effects. We also explored the possibility of using more informative priors based on daily death rates from European countries. But this had almost no effect on the fit of the model. Model fitting was carried out using the rstanarm package in R [Goodrich et al., 2020] . Forward-looking model projections are based on draws from the posterior predictive distribution. Because of the way that our covariates are constructed (see below), most of the x values for these forward-looking projections correspond to social-distancing behavior that has already been observed. However, at a longer horizon some extrapolation of x is necessary to generate projections; here we assume that socialdistancing behavior in a state remains unchanged from the average behavior over the seven most recent days of available data.",

The data were provided to us in an aggregated format; no device-level data or individual GPS traces were accessible by the research team. Figure 2 shows a selection of these social-distancing measures over time in both New York and Texas. We denote these D distancing metrics s it,1 , . . . , s it,D , observed each day in each state. To construct useful covariates out of this information, we proceed as follows. For each distancing metric s j , define a corresponding lagged versio\u00f1 s j as follows:s it,j = L \u2211 l=1 w l s i,t\u2212l,j where w = (w 1 , . . . , w L ) is a fixed vector of backward looking weights. The lagging is necessary to account for the time from infection to death. Social distancing actions taken on day t will not result in an immediate change in death rates; rather, the effect will show up many days in the future. We therefore tune this weight vector based on prior knowledge of the distribution of lags between infection with COVID-19 and death. Specifically, w is a Gaussian kernel centered 23.5 days in the past, with a standard deviation of 6 days. This is based on published estimates of time from contraction to illness onset [Lauer et al., 2020] and on time from illness onset to death [Zhou et al., 2020] .",

The socialdistancing predictors we use in our model quantify visitation patterns to various points of interest, using GPS traces derived from mobile phones. The vertical axis is standardized so that 0 represents a pre-pandemic baseline, and -0.5 indicates a 50% decrease in visitations relative to that baseline. The vertical lines in each panel represent the day in which the state death rate reached 3 per 10 million residents. One can see that social distancing in Texas began substantially before this threshold day was reached, but much nearer this day in New York. 9 All rights reserved.

In particular, the authors use the inverse-Hessian matrix at the MAP estimate in order to produce uncertainty estimates. This uncertainty quantification procedure, however, implicitly assumes that successive observations are independent. Indeed, without this assumption, it is not generally true that the inverse-Hessian at the MAP provides a valid large-sample estimate for the covariance matrix of an estimator, Bayesian or otherwise. This important technical condition simply cannot be true on the scale used for fitting the IHME model, for the simple reason that the data used for fitting are cumulative: if today's prediction for cumulative death rate is too high, then tomorrow's prediction is more likely to be too high as well. This is easily verified by a simple calculation. The covariance of two successive cumulative death rates r it is: cov(r i,t , r i,t+1 ) = cov(r i,t , r i,t + y i,t+1 ) = var(r it ) + cov(r i,t , y i,t+1 ) = N \u22122 var \u2211 s<t y it + cov(r i,t , y i,t+1 )",
