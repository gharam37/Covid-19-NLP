These include conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), which are most commonly used as the first line treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 2, 3 Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been proposed as potential treatment options for COVID-19 based on its mechanism of action. Accumulating in the acid vesicles (endosome, Golgi vesicles, lysosomes), HCQ causes alkalinisation, leading to enzyme dysfunction and preventing endosome mediated viral entry to the cell. [3] [4] [5] [6] It is also suggested in vitro that HCQ can prevent glycosylation of virus cell proteins including the ACE2 receptor, inhibiting virus entry and replication, and that similar compounds like chloroquine can specifically inhibit SARS-Cov-2. 5, [7] [8] [9] In clinical studies, the addition of HCQ has shown increased early virological response to treatment for chronic hepatitis C, and reduced viral load in patients with HIV infection, compared to placebo. 10, 11 Treatment with HCQ also lowered IL-6 level in HIV patients, suggesting the agent may have immunosuppressive properties helpful in the prevention or treatment of cytokine storm associated with severe COVID-19 disease. 12, 13 As of 28 th March 2020, there are over 21 registered ongoing clinical trials and 3 prophylactic studies assessing the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine HCQ for the treatment of SARS-Cov-2. 14-20 Early results from randomised controlled trials conducted in China have shown reduced severity and course of the disease with hydroxychloroquine HCQ, compared with placebo, without detecting serious adverse effects, although others have suggested no difference in outcome from conventional treatment. 21, 22 Of those studies that have reported more detailed results and received significant media attention, HCQ .

The method is self-controlled in that it makes within-person comparisons of event rates during periods of hypothesized increase risk with other periods of baseline risk, with eliminates all time-invariant confounding. Because we do not compare between persons, the SCCS is robust to between-person differences, even including unmeasured differences (like genetics). However, the method is vulnerable to time-varying confounders: the time of exposure may be incomparable to the time when not exposed. To adjust for this, we included many time-varying co-variates in the models, including age, season, and other drug exposures. The effects of age and season were assumed constant within each calendar month and were modelled using bicubic splines with 5 knots. A conditional Poisson regression was used to fit the outcome model using the Cyclops package, with a hyperparameter selected through 10-fold crossvalidation. 46 Study diagnostics (power, propensity score distribution, covariate balance, empirical null distribution) were evaluated by clinicians and epidemiologists to determine which database-target-comparatoroutcome-analysis variants could produce unbiased estimates. Database-target-comparator-analysis variants with zero event outcomes in the time-at-risk window or contained analyses with baseline covariate with standardized mean difference>0.1 after stratification were excluded from analysis.

Due to the nature of sudden cardiac death, capturing the true cause of cardiovascular related mortality is difficult. We therefore have explored cardiovascular related outcomes other than mortality to determine if deterioration in these pathophysiological processes led to increased mortality. Since this is not seen, and sudden cardiac death in association with prolonged QT interval is described in the literature, our conclusions are drawn from these assumptions. It should be acknowledged that misclassification can occur due to non-adherence or non-compliance with exposure medication, and incomplete lack of recording of SAEs may lead to underestimation of these outcomes.",

We have taken into consideration that patients with RA taking HCQ may also have further auto-immune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and therefore generate the potential for confounding by indication. 50 We therefore ensured that when investigating covariate balance after propensity score stratification and matching and before unblinding study results, that we did not see unbalanced proportions of patients with a diagnosis of SLE between the groups. Negative control outcome analyses also did not identify any residual unobserved confounding in the PS analysis.",

HCQ appears to be largely safe in both direct and comparative analysis for short term use, but when used in combination with AZM this therapy carries double the risk of cardiovascular death in patients with RA. Whereas we used the collective experience of a million patients to build our confidence in the evidence around the safety profile, the current evidence around efficacy of HCQ+AZI in the treatment of covid-19 is quite limited and controversial.",
