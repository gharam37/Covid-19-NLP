Justified by the sigmoidal nature of a pandemic, i.e. initial exponential spread to eventual saturation, we apply the GM to existing data, as of April 2, 2020, from 25 countries during first corona pandemic wave and study the model's predictions. We find that logarithmic daily fatalities caused by Covid-19 are well described by a quadratic function in time. By fitting the data to second order polynomials from a statistical \u03c7 2 -fit with 95% confidence, we are able to obtain the characteristic parameters of the GM, i.e. a width, peak height and time of peak, for each country separately, with which we extrapolate to future times to make predictions. We provide evidence that this supposedly oversimplifying model might still have predictive power and use it to forecast the further course of the fatalities caused by Covid-19 per country, including peak number of deaths per day, date of peak, and duration within most deaths occur. While our main goal is to present the general idea of the simple modeling process using GMs, we also describe possible estimates for the number of required respiratory machines and the duration left until the number of infected will be significantly reduced. * Corresponding author \u2020 Electronic address: rsch@tp4.ruhr-uni-bochum.de \u2021 Electronic address: mk@mat.ethz.ch \u00a7 We submitted the first version to medRxiv.org (MEDRXIV/2020/055830) on April 5, 2020.

            "text": "Nowadays, numerous models to predict the spreading of infectious diseases like Covid-19 are available, for example the actively discussed susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model [9] [10] [11] . Many of these models are either toy models that cannot make reliable predictions or they are so complex, by taking into account a wide range of factors, that simple predictions are not possible. In times of the coronavirus epidemic, predictions such as the maximum number of fatalities per day or the date of the peak number of newly seriously sick persons per day (SSPs) are valuable data for governments around the world, especially those facing the beginning of an exponential increase of casualties, and we hope to serve the people in charge with the here presented approach. In particular, fast predictions on the course of the coronavirus disease are crucial for policy makers to optimize their managing of the disease wave. To feed into the current debate on infectious disease models, we would like to propose a Gauss model (GM) as a simple, but effective description of fatalities caused by Covid-19 over time, similar to recent studies for the US [12] and for Germany [13] . In contrast to this previous work, we choose to use the logarithm of the reported daily death rates [2] , instead of cumulative infections, as monitored input data and we also do not rely on doubling times.",

The cumulative deaths are the sum of all previous daily deaths up to today, while the number of daily deaths in turn is the difference of two consecutive days in cumulative deaths.

Deaths are better documented than monitored infections in nearly all countries. A death caused by Covid-19 is easier to count than an infection, which might as well cause none to moderate symptoms and hence might remain uncounted. Statistically, a constant fraction of infected die from Covid-19 at a later time after being registered as infected [4, 19] . Thus, infection and death curves are equivalent descriptions of time evolution of Covid-19, and the coefficients characterizing their shape can be expected to be closely related. To demonstrate that both, infections and deaths, follow the GM, we analyzed and show results for both measures.",

For mathematical details, please refer to the appendix. To demonstrate the universal Gaussian nature of the daily fatalities over time d, we display them in Fig. 3(a,b) , normalized so that all curves have unit width, maximum and time of maximum. The same plots for the cumulative fatalities D are shown in Fig. 3(c,d) . Daily infections i, daily fatalities d, cumulative infections I and cumulative fatalities D, all fit neatly onto the unit GM curve or its cumulative function, plotted in gray in the back for reference. China, which is the only country to provide data from its first pandemic wave for times greater than 0.6 (in normalized units), fits to the GM well over the entire significant course of infections and fatalities. This sparks the hope that the used GM will have predictive power for the remaining countries also after the maximum. The fits already provide sufficient evidence that the part prior to the maximum is captured well by the GM. The resulting GM parameters are listed and plotted in Fig. 4 . For most countries the GM width is within 10 and 15 days, roughly half of all countries have passed their peak of daily fatalities already and the peak is roughly below 20 fatalities per day and per million people. .

First, the time evolution of the number of cumulative fatalities D, plotted in Fig. 5 , can be obtained by summing daily number of deaths d, predicted by our model. In this figure, we rescaled all curves back to normal times so that the future course of cumulative deaths can be easily read-off. One can compute analytically that the date after which the new deaths per day have decreased to 1% of their maximum lies roughly 2 widths after the maximum of daily deaths, and the values, denoted by T \u03b7 , for each country can be found in Fig. 4 (a). Already from visual inspection Fig. 5 suggests for Italy and Spain to plateau first, while France will have to face increasing number of fatalities considerably longer.

Thus, we may roughly estimate the number of active SSPs per date as the sum of people that became seriously sick within the past 10 days. Please note, however, that we try to only conceptually link the GM to useful quantities, we leave a thorough search of exact numbers to the reader. As a final step, we need relate SSPs and deaths. Assume that each SSP dies with a constant probability \u03b3 after some days, i.e. \u03b3 times SSPS gives the daily fatalities some days ahead. Taking again numbers from Ref. [19] , we could use that each deceased patient had used a respiratory machine for an average of 7 days prior to death and thus estimate the daily number of SSPs at a given date by the number of daily fatalities 7 days in the future divided by probability \u03b3.",

One of more prominent ones recently appeared in the Washington Post [14] . Stevens investigated what happens when simulitis spreads in a town, if everyone in the town starts at a random position, moving at a random angle, infecting others upon collision, and recovering after a certain time. The simulated number of infected people rises rapidly as the disease spreads and tapers off as people recover -a bell-shaped curve. We recreated the simulations and found evidence for the applicability of the GM under many circumstances. These results are not reported here, but support our central assumption. From another recent work using a holistic agent-based model [3] , where the agents adapt their behavior through artificial intelligence as part of the solution, there seems also evidence from the numerical results presented, that the number of newly infected may be well captured by a Gaussian function.",

Intuitively, we know that the cumulative number of cases for a wave of any pandemic must start from a constant (often 0), then increase exponentially and eventually saturate at a higher constant level. Functions that capture such a behavior, i.e. a smooth change from a lower constant to a higher constant over a finite duration, are called sigmoidal. The derivative of sigmoidal functions have a bell-shaped form, similar to a Gaussian function, but may be asymmetric in general. We here model the daily fatalities d, formally the derivative of the cumulative fatalities D. Since we expect cumulative cases D to be sigmoidal, from common-sense reasoning as argued above, this fixes the derivative, the daily fatalities d, to a bell-shaped form. Even though all pandemics thus give rise to bell-shaped d by this argument, the curve's parameters might differ, influenced mostly by policy, health system and culture. The predictive power of our model rests on the assumption that these influences are encoded already into the early data of casualties, combined with the assumption that the principal shape of all pandemics is fixed. This is of course an unjustified assumption or, if at all, justified only in a statistical sense when considering large number of trials. Why do we choose a symmetric bell-shaped form, the Gaussian function? We recognize that other models, such as Poisson functions that fade out slower after their maximum, might be more realistic. However, a symmetric function is the simplest model among all bell-shaped functions and works well enough to convey the idea of such models. Second, the times of greatest interest to policy makers are until the bell-curve's peak since once passed the health system should be able to cope.",

Instead, we here choose to fit the logarithm of daily change of cases d, not the cumulative cases D. The logarithm of d weights more evenly values close to the functions maximum and disregards other values. We believe this leads to a more stable model of d around its maximum, the turning point of D, and the time of interest since most relevant predictions such as peak of the pandemic, time point and width of peak are focused around this maximum.",

Other exponential models report considerable deviations from an exponential nature, e.g. a power law behavior as the curve flattens [16] . Sigmoidal functions automatically account for exponential growth and subsequent flattening and we thus believe them to be a better predictor. We must note that we aim to be compared with descriptive models, i.e. models that work only in the statistical limit of large data.
