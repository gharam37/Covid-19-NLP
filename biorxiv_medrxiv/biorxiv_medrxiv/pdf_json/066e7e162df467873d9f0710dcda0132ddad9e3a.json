Consent for autopsy was non-restricted by the next of kin, and these studies on autopsy tissues were determined to be exempt by the IRB at LSU Health Sciences Center and Tulane University. We demonstrate near-teravoxel volumetric images of optically-cleared lung tissue over cubic millimeter volumes with virtual H&E contrast and at submicron resolution. Our work builds on the prior autopsy case-series report from LSU-HSC, confirming and expanding novel findings of widespread pulmonary microangiopathy involving activation of mature megakaryocytes in the lung. Figure 1 contains reconstructed volumes, selected optical slices, and 3D renderings from a 7.8 mm \u00d7 5.9 mm \u00d7 0.9 mm formalin-fixed block of lung tissue sampled from the left peripheral upper lobe. Tissue blocks were stained with TO-PRO-3 for nuclear contrast and Eosin-Y for cytoplasmic/stromal contrast, followed by optical clearing with ethyl-cinnamate, according to the method of Reder et al. 7 Blocks were then imaged using one side of a dual-inverted selective plane illumination microscope 12 customized for large cleared tissue imaging, described previously. 8, 11 Two grayscale images were collected corresponding to each fluorescent label, which were reconstructed independently, and synthesized into a single pseudo-colored RGB image replicating the color palette and appearance of H&E staining using the approach described by Giacomelli et al. (Supplemental Figure 1) . 5 The total raw volume in Figure 1a comprised 929 gigavoxels, with a voxel size of 0.363 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.363 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.363 \u03bcm. A smaller volume (1.2 mm \u00d7 0.6 mm \u00d7 0.3 mm comprising 4.5 gigavoxels) was selected from the larger volume for detailed visualization. Supplemental Video 1 shows all slices from all orthogonal orientations in the volume. Figure 1b shows a single XY slice from the smaller subvolume -the location of the slice in the volume is shown in the inset of Figure 1a . Prominent features observed in this virtual H&E slice included a megakaryocyte in a branching small vessel, apparent multi-nucleated or grouped cells demonstrating viral cytopathic changes including prominent nucleoli in the alveolar space, and scattered hyaline-fibrin aggregates in the alveolar spaces. Further analysis of these areas in 3D (Figure 1c ) provided additional value in interpretation, confirming that the megakaryocyte displayed the expected lobular, fused multinuclear shape (Supplemental Video 2), enabling determination that the apparent multi-nucleated cell with viral cytopathic effect in Figure 1b was in fact a cluster of independent cells, and showing a spherical hyaline-fibrin aggregate surrounded by apparent inflammatory cells in the alveolar space, consistent with diffuse alveolar damage. author/funder.

Notably, we were able to confirm the finding of activated mature megakaryocytes in the small vessels of the lung by inspection of their large, multiple, lobular nuclei conforming to the shape of the vessel in 3 dimensions. Additionally, 3D inspection of cells that appeared to be large multinucleated cells on 2D slices, enabled more accurate determination of a cell cluster. Three-dimensional imaging also revealed the massive extent of small vessel thrombosis in the lung. While small deposits of fibrin may be associated with diffuse alveolar damage more generally, 3D imaging allowed us to visualize the pathologic extent of fibrin deposition and clot formation with inflammatory cell attachment, which was far more extensive than revealed in 2D alone, providing additional strong support for the independent role of pulmonary microangiopathy in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 apart from diffuse alveolar damage.",

The technological approach used here follows that described previously by our group and others. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] 11, 13 The specific fluorescence contrast scheme used here to replicate H&E, 7 like similar schemes reported previously, 4-6 has been shown repeatedly to provide reliable and accurate analogs to traditional H&E contrast in fluorescence microscopy. While our images were collected with a specific variant of light sheet microscopy, similar images could be obtained at varying levels of throughput with other optical sectioning microscopes. This approach will not likely soon replace traditional 2D histopathology due to its relative complexity and the size of the data generated -for a single sample from a single patient, we generated images nearing 1 teravoxel in size and exceeding 1.5 TB of processed data for the sample. However, it could serve as a useful adjunct to traditional histopathology, as shown here. In particular, as the figures and supplemental videos show, inspection of the 3D data provides a more comprehensive and intuitive understanding of the changes due to disease. While this report is limited to a single sample from a single patient, the utility of the findings support continued study on tissues from multiple organs from a wider cohort of patients, and with the addition of specific molecular markers, which is the subject of ongoing work.",

The system used to acquire 3D images in this work was a customized dual-view inverted selective plane microscopy (diSPIM) system, originally developed by Hari Shroff and co-workers and commercialized by Applied Scientific Instrumentation (ASI, Eugene, OR). 12 Our system has been modified for large cleared tissue imaging with adjustable illumination tube lenses and dual Cleared Tissue Objectives (CTO, ASI/Special Optics, 15.3X -17.9X, NA: 0.37-0.43 over RI range of 1.33 to 1.55, working distance: 12 mm) in order to adapt to diverse immersion mounting media, as described previously. 8 The system is fitted with a 488-nm laser source (Omicron, PhoxX; maximum power = 200 mW) for fluorescence excitation of Eosin and a 647-nm laser source (Omicron, PhoxX; maximum power = 140 mW) for fluorescence excitation of TO-PRO-3 iodide. During imaging, the lung sample was immersed in ECi in a custom sample chamber, and imaged from above using the standard diSPIM arrangement. 8, 11 No additional material or interface was introduced between the objective lens surfaces and the cleared tissue other than the ECi immersion media, and no compression was applied, enabling reconstruction of the natural tissue surface topography. Although the system can be used to acquire 2 orthogonal views of the sample for dual-view imaging and reconstruction, 8, 12, 14 in this work only one view was acquired. Captured light-sheet images from a scientific CMOS camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0v2) were transferred to a controller workstation (Dell T3610) and stored in an 8TB SSD array set as RAID 0 mode. The raw data comprised a stack of 221,400 individual images with a single frame size of 2,048 pixels by 2,048 pixels, giving a total raw volume of 929 gigavoxels with a total file size of 1.69 TB.",

The first step was to conduct affine transformation and interpolation to shear vertical light-sheet images by 45 degrees horizontally plane-by-plane with assistance of data batching and parallel computation in MATLAB. 15 Afterwards, illumination correction was conducted along the depth of each image, and all stacks of reconstructed volumes were stitched together to form the whole volume in FIJI. 16 Then, the two 3D volumes of fluorescence images corresponding to the eosin and TO-PRO-3 channels were combined into a pseudo-color image in order to mimic the color palette of hematoxylin and eosin using the Virtual Transillumination Microscopy approach developed by Giacomelli et al. 5 Visualizations of the 3D images were performed on both the single channel as well as pseudo-H&E volumes. Full volume visualizations were realized using Amira (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on 4 times downsampled images. After regions of interest were identified, sub-volumes were loaded at full resolution into Amira and the OpenViSUS 17 interactive framework for further visualization. Volume renders for Figure 2c were created with a mixture of the single channel nuclear (TO-PRO-3) and pseudo-H&E volumes to visualize the cellular and tissue architectural detail using standard texture-based volume rendering. 18 The visualizations for hyaline-fibrin aggregate and infected pneumocytes used the pseudo-H&E volume with the volume rendering transfer function designed to give semi-transparent stroma. The transfer function of the nuclear field was designed to give high intensity values an opaque, purple color while making mid to low intensity values transparency. For the megakaryocyte and infected cell cluster visualization, the single channel nuclear volume was added with standard volume shading applied to give perceptual hints of nuclei shape. Rendering order was enforced to make the nuclei field appear on top, avoiding nuclei color attenuation from the stroma in the pseudo-H&E volume. Rendering of the small vessel pulmonary microangiopathy was performed in a two-pass approach. First the single channel nuclear volume was thresholded to give all mid-to-high intensity nuclei maximum intensity. After this thresholding, this new field was blurred (Gaussian with a 30 pixel support). This blurring removed the contribution of regions with low concentrations of nuclei while maintaining the regions with large clusters to isolate the high cell density in the vessel thrombus. A similar transfer function as above was applied to this new field.",
