            "text": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic spread to the UK in early 2020 with the first few cases being identified in late January. A rapid increase in confirmed cases started in March, and the number of infected people is however unknown, largely due to the rather limited testing scale. A number of reports published so far reveal that the COVID-19 has long incubation period, high fatality ratio and non-specific symptoms, making this novel coronavirus far different from common seasonal influenza. In this note, we present a modified SEIR model which takes into account the time lag effect and probability distribution of model states. Based on the proposed model, it is estimated that the actual total number of infected people by 1 April in the UK might have already exceeded 610,000. Average fatality rates under different assumptions at the beginning of April 2020 are also estimated. Our model also reveals that the R 0 value is between 7.5-9 which is much larger than most of the previously reported values. The proposed model has a potential to be used for assessing future epidemic situations under different intervention strategies.",

Figure 2 illustrates the basic structure of the SEIR model, a SIR derivative, where S(t) represents the susceptible cases at day t, E(t) is for the exposed cases at day t, I(t) stands for the infectious cases at day t and I \u03a3 (t) denotes the total infected population at day t.

Hence, the total number of infections would exceed 2 million if IFR \u03ba is below 1%.

In our estimate R 0 \u2248 8.8 which is much larger than the results obtained in other published papers. However if we assume anyone who is infected by the virus will be under quarantine 7 days after s/he becomes infectious, then our model estimate for R 0 \u2248 2.8-3.6 which is comparable to the current popular estimates of R 0 reported in the literature [10] . The reason for our estimated R 0 being much larger than the R 0 estimates reported in the literature might be due to that there is a large proportion of people who only got mild symptoms or even were asymptomatic. They can spread the virus before symptom onset till recovery over a long period of time before the lockdown measure was put in place.",

Figure 9 and Figure 10 show different curves representing possible daily increase in death toll and daily increase in hospital treatment requirements under different reproduction rates. Clearly if the reproduction rate is suppressed below 1, both numbers will keep decreasing. However even the viral transmission is managed to the minimum, the daily death toll will still likely keep at a high level (>500) for two weeks. Based on the current data 6 in the UK, our model also projects that the inflection point of current pandemic wave in the UK is likely to occur in the following week (between 12-15 April 2020) if the lockdown rules are strictly obeyed by people.",

Also according to the proposed model, the value of R 0 is much greater than the previously published values in the literature, if no intervention measure is implemented. The estimated range of R 0 is between 7.5-9 due to large proportion of patients with mild symptoms.
