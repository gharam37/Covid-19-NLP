The only explicit parameter of the model is the population density. The implicit parameter is a moving average ambient temperature, currently integrated into the kinetic constants. Other finer details pertaining to the mechanism of the pathogen SARS-CoV-2 spread within a given region are implicitly manifested in the exponent parameters derived from the non-linear fitting of the published data on Covid-19 occurrence. The performance of the model is demonstrated on a few selected countries, and on the Diamond Princess cruising ship outbreak. The model might be used as an aiding tool for the policy makers regarding the decisions on the containment measures and quarantine regime required.",

First time in the civilization history quarantine measures of different magnitude were implemented in almost all countries, and passenger traffic ceased. The governmental reactions to the disease spread ranged. South-East Asia countries were tending more to strict martial-law style restrictions. Some of the Northern Europe governments were trying to promote \"herd immunity\" concept, where the vulnerable members of the society (e.g. the elderly and immuno-compromised) were isolated, while the others were allowed to be with no restrictions. Allegedly, this strategy was to eventually terminate the disease spread due to most of the society would be immune.",

There is an indication that the disease spread is much slower in hotter climates and in certain humidity levels. A clear example is India and most of Africa, where the cases are very low compared to the population numbers. Indeed, recent studies have shown that the temperature optimum for the SARS-CoV viruses stability in the environment is around 4\u00b0C, yet the humidity also have significant impact [1, 2] . 3. A relatively lengthy incubation period (5-14 days [3] ) combined with about tenfold rate of undiagnosed cases [4] compared to the reported ones signals that the virus is struggling reproducing in humans. In other terms, it is fast to spread, but not thermodynamically stable once inside the body.",

It appears that the models might behave quite unpredictably depending on the selection of the start day in the flat initial region, when the fluctuation in the rates is high.

The countries in this category are very diverse in terms of climate, governmental practices, and societal norms.
