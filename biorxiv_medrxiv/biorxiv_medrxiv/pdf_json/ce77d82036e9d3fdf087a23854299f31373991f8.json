Italy, the Western country with most COVID-19 related deaths, was the first to implement drastic containment measures in early March, 2020. Since then most other European countries, the USA, Canada and Australia, have implemented similar restrictions, ranging from school closures, banning of recreational activities and large events, to complete lockdown. Such limitations, and softer promotion of social distancing, may be more effective in one society than in another due to cultural or political differences. It is therefore important to evaluate the effectiveness of these initiatives by analyzing country-specific COVID-19 data. We propose to model COVID-19 dynamics with a SIQR (susceptible -infectious -quarantined -recovered) model, since confirmed positive cases are isolated and do not transmit the disease. We provide an explicit formula that is easily implemented and permits us to fit official COVID-19 data in a series of Western countries. We found excellent agreement with data-driven estimation of the day-of-change in disease dynamics and the dates when official interventions were introduced. Our analysis predicts that for most countries only the more drastic restrictions have reduced virus spreading. Further, we predict that the number of unidentified COVID-19-positive individuals at the beginning of the epidemic is \u223c10 times the number of confirmed cases. Our results provide important insight for future planning of non-pharmacological interventions aiming to contain spreading of COVID-19 and similar diseases.",

After the first severe patient was brought to the hospital of Codogno, Italy on February 20, 2020, and subsequently tested positive for SARS-nCov2, a rapidly increasing number of patients have been identified, initially in Northern Italy and later in the rest of the country and Europe. Italy is the most affected Western country, with more than 130.000 1 confirmed cases, a death toll of \u223c16.000, and the first to implement drastic measures in an attempt to contain the disease. Since then, most other European countries, the USA and Canada, have implemented similar restrictions, ranging from school closures, banning of recreational activities and large events, to complete lockdown. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of these initiatives, it is necessary to analyze COVID-19 data carefully to investigate if and how the limitations in societal activities affect the disease dynamics.",

For example, school closures may have secondary effects concerning \"smart working\" of the parents staying at home with the children. However, the possibility to work from home depends on the type of job, so that school closures may have a bigger effect in countries with more tertiary sector jobs compared to, for example, factories. Further, there are social aspects that come into play, such as the possibility of grandparents to care for the children when schools close, which makes it possible for parents to continue working, but also expose the older citizens, who are the most vulnerable to COVID-19, to the disease. Naturally, also the relative number of children in the society play a role. Another important aspect to consider concerns national and regional cultural and psychological differences for example regarding respect versus authorities. If the general population does not trust the communications coming from health and political authorities, or if these communications are confusing and contradictory, more stringent bans can be necessary in order to contain the disease, since softer suggestions may not be followed.",

In this model, infected individuals may be isolated, entering the \"quarantined\" subpopulation Q, so that these individuals no longer transmit the disease. Since positive cases are put in isolation (in hospitals or at home) immediately, the revealed data of active cases thus corresponds to the number of individuals in state Q. It would not be correct to confront the infectious subpopulation of a SIR/SEIR (susceptible -infectious -[exposed] -recovered) model with the recorded data, since it is unknown how many infectious but undetected individuals are circulating in the population. As will be clear in the following, besides being conceptually clearer, the explicit quantification of the quarantined individuals will allow us to provide estimates of the infectious cases at the very beginning of the epidemic outbreak as well as of the current number of undetected infectious individuals.",

In other European countries (Spain, France, Germany, Switzerland), which saw the epidemic arriving a few days later than Italy, the estimated initial number of infectious individuals is 600-800. In contrast, for B.C. in Canada and N.S.W. in Australia, which had more time to prepare for COVID-19, this number was only \u223c200 when the number of confirmed cases reached 50.",

In New South Wales schools are not closed, but parents were invited to keep their children at home on March 23, 2020. This date coincides almost perfectly with our estimated date-of-change, suggesting that this invitation has been followed, and has had immediate effect. Indirect effects likely contribute: keeping children at home often means that their parent will work from home, and in addition, the increased awareness of the situation following such an invitation may have wider, general effects, as might be expected to have occurred in N.S.W. Similarly, B.C. has not imposed lockdown, although schools were closed on March 18, 2020 (in agreement with our estimated date-of-change) and restaurants are only allowed to sell take-away food.",

On March 16 the government of Austria prohibited gatherings of groups of more than five people in public, and all schools were closed from March 17. On this latter date, the closure of restaurants was also ordered.
