In humans, the viruses can cause mild respiratory infections but can also lead to serious infections such as pneumonia. During the past decade, two human coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were the source of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics in 2002 and 2012 respectively. 1 The newly identified SARS-CoV2 is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the coronavirus crown virus family of the subfamily Orthocoronaviridae. SARS-CoV2 appears to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and a coronavirus of unknown origin. 2 The virus was first detected in December 2019 in Hubei province of China [3] [4] [5] and spread widely throughout China before crossing the borders into other countries. 6 SARS-CoV2 is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets but can also be spread through aerial droplets and contact. 7 Covid-19 is the emerging infectious disease due to SARS-CoV2. The clinical features of Covid-19 are lower respiratory infection 8 with a mortality rate of approximately 2% to 4%, 9 but asymptomatic cases have also been reported. 10 The estimated median incubation period of COVID-19 was 5.1 days (CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days) in a pooled analysis of 181 confirmed cases reported from around the world. 11 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Covid-19 a pandemic, pointing to the over 118,000 cases of coronavirus in over 110 countries and territories around the world with the sustained risk of further global spread.",

In addition, specific measures are being applied to patients who should be cared for in single rooms if possible, wear surgical masks and practice strict hand hygiene using hydroalcoholic solutions. Specific recommendations have also been issued from the WHO and Centers for Disease Control. 13, 14 As for the SARS and MERS-CoV epidemics and other respiratory viruses such as influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), cases of intra-hospital transmission of SARS-CoV2 have been reported and are going to continue to occur. In Wuhan alone, 1,080 healthcare professionals (HCP) were infected. 15 In China, more than 3,300 HCP were infected as of early March and in Italy, 20% of the HCP participating in a survey reported Covid-19 infections. 16 HCP have a key position in the transmission process because they are exposed to both community-acquired and nosocomial cases. 17, 18 This risk is amplified when the incidence of the infection in the community is high. In the current context of high incidence rates of SARS-CoV2 in the community, a significant increase in the rate of nosocomial transmission is therefore expected. The risk of nosocomial transmission would be even higher in low-income countries owing to several factors such as the delay in diagnosis of Covid-19 patients, and the lack of infrastructure, trained personnel, isolation units, and infection control programs. 6 NOSO-COR Protocol, Version 1 28/02/2020",

For example, the configuration of care units also appears to play a role in transmission.

Discussion Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV2, including nosocomial transmission, is now well documented. The risk of amplification of spread of the disease in healthcare facilities is strong in case of a lack of infection control measures. Early recognition of nosocomial Covid-19 infection in patients or HCP is therefore essential for the setting up of immediate investigation and implementation of appropriate hygiene measures. Describing the signs and symptoms associated with nosocomial Covid-19 will enable comparisons with existing data on other nosocomial viral respiratory infections (i.e. influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV).",

Communication of the results of this study could raise awareness among HCP and CG vis\u00e0-vis their roles in preventing the spread of the virus in hospitals and in their immediate surroundings and could be used to support vaccination coverage should a vaccine become available in the future. The contribution of strain genotyping, when this data becomes available on a large scale, could complement epidemiological investigations targeting nosocomial transmission of Covid-19. 24",
