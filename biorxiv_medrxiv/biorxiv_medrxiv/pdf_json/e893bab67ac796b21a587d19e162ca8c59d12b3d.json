The virus engages the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), through the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein. The contact surface of ACE2 displays amino acid residues that are critical for virus recognition, and variations at these critical residues are likely to modulate infection susceptibility across species. While infection studies have shown that rhesus macaques exposed to the virus develop COVID-19-like symptoms, the susceptibility of other nonhuman primates is unknown.

Recognizing the potential danger of COVID-19 to nonhuman primates, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), together with the Great Apes section of the Primate Specialist Group, released a joint statement on precautions that should be taken for researchers and caretakers when interacting with great apes 10 .

            "text": "While the biology underlying susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be fully elucidated, the viral target is well established. The SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to the cellular receptor protein angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which is expressed on the extracellular surface of endothelial cells of diverse bodily tissues, including the lungs, kidneys, small intestine and renal tubes 11 . Characterizations of the infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated that the binding affinity for the human ACE2 receptor is high, which is a key factor in determining the susceptibility and transmission dynamics. When compared to SARS-CoV, which caused a serious global outbreak of disease in 2002-2003 12,13 , the binding affinity between SARS-CoV2 and ACE2 is estimated to be between 4-fold 14-17 and 10-to 20-fold greater 18 . Recent reports describing structural characterization of ACE2 in complex with the SARS-CoV2 spike protein receptor binding domain [14] [15] [16] [17] allow identification of the key binding residues that enable the host-pathogen protein-protein recognition. Approaches examining variation in ACE2 tissue expression and gene sequences can offer insight into variation in human susceptibility to COVID-19 19, 20 . Similarly, we can use such an approach to compare sequence variation across species, and hence try to predict the likely interspecific variation in susceptibility. Previous analysis of comparative variation at these sites enabled estimates of the affinity of the ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV in nonhuman species 21 . Here, we undertake such an analysis for SARS-CoV-2 across the primate radiation.",

Results of protein-protein interaction experiments predicting impact of amino acid changes, relative to human ACE2 residues, at critical binding sites with SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain. Impacts of changes across the full complement of critical binding sites are presented in (A), single residue replacements are presented in (B). The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . Figure 1 . ACE2 protein sequence alignment and phylogeny of study species. Branch lengths represent evolutionary distance estimated from TimeTree.org 27 . We outline amino acid residues at critical binding sites for the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain. Solid outlines highlight sites predicted to have the most substantial impact on viral binding affinity. Notably, protein sequences of catarrhine primates are highly conserved, including uniformity among amino acids at all binding sites. Primate species that are able to be successfully infected with COVID-19 are indicated in red. Predicted susceptibility to COVID-19 for other primates is additionally coded by terminal branch colors.

            "text": "ACE2 gene and translated protein sequences are strongly conserved across primates. Few amino acid substitutions are present, and gene trees closely recapitulate the currently accepted phylogeny of primates (Figure 1; Suppl. Fig. S2 a,b). In particular, the twelve sites in the ACE2 protein that are critical for binding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are invariant across the Catarrhini, which includes great apes, gibbons, and monkeys of Africa and Asia (Figure 1). The other major radiation of monkeys, those found in the Americas (Platyrrhini), have less similar ACE2 sequences across the length of the protein. They share nine of twelve critical amino acid residues with catarrhine primates; the three sites that vary from catarrhines, H41, E42 and T82, are conserved within this clade. Strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers, with the exception of Propithecus coquereli, also have an H41 residue, and additionally have further amino acid variation inside and outside of the binding sites. In non-primate mammals, an increasing number of substitutions are evident, including at critical binding sites. All species possess a different residue to primates at site 24. Bats are exceptionally variable, with the genus Rhinolophus alone encompassing all of the variation seen in the rest of the non-primate mammals. Where primates have glutamine (Q24), bats have glutamate (E24), lysine (K24), leucine (L24), or arginine (R24) (Figure 1). All fasta alignments of ACE2 gene and protein sequences are available on GitHub 26 and available in the supplemental materials.",

            "text": "Intriguingly, all but 2 bat species we examined have the putatively protective variant, H41. Further clinical and laboratory study is needed to fully understand infection dynamics. There are a number of important caveats to our study. Firstly, all of our predictions are based on interpretations of gene and resultant amino acid sequences. Some of our results, such as the uniform conservation of ACE2 among catarrhines, backed up by the demonstrated high susceptibility of humans and rhesus macaques to SARS-CoV-2, should give a good degree of confidence of high levels of risk. Given the identical residues of humans to other apes and monkeys in Asia and Africa at the target site, it seems unlikely that the ACE2 receptor and the SARS-CoV-2 proteins would not readily bind. Our results for other taxa are dependent on modeling, hence should be treated more cautiously. This includes all interpretations of the susceptibility of platyrrhines and strepsirrhines, where the effects of residue differences on binding affinities have been estimated based on protein-protein interaction modeling. Another caveat is that we have modeled only interactions at binding sites, and not predictions based on full residue sequence variation. Residues that are not in direct contact may still affect binding allosterically.",
