Optimisation algorithms were used to 23 get basic reproduction rate for different phases of nonpharmaceutical 24 interventions rolled by the government. Peak accumulation is projected towards 25 end of July with 36% of the population being infected by August 2020 if the 26 population lockdown or social distancing mechanism is not continued. The 27 number of deaths assuming no intervention is projected to be 488000 (95% CI: 28 (329400, 646600)). A draconian enforcement of population lockdown combined 29 with hand and face hygiene adherence would reduce the transmission by at least 30 99.7% whereas partial social distancing and hygiene would reduce it by 51.2%. 31 Transmission parameters reported should be interpreted with caution as they are 32 population aggregated and do not consider unique characteristics of 33 susceptibility among micro-clusters and vulnerable individuals. More data will 34 need to be collected to optimize transmission parameters and evaluate the full 35 complexity, to simulate real world scenarios in the models. The announcement of the novel corona Virus (COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2) as pandemic was 51 made on January 30 th 2020 [1] . The first case of COVID-19 was detected in India on January 52 30 th , 2020. As of 30 th March 2020, more than 1250 cases had been identified in India, with 32 53 deaths and 102 cases have been discharged after treatment [2] . Many key aspects about the 54 disease dynamics are not known. To improve the understanding about the virus many 55 researchers continue to contribute through peer review journals, blogs, reports and social media 56 platforms [3]. One of the key endeavours among these knowledge products is the quest to 57 quantify the burden of disease through the use of mathematical modelling [4,5,6] so that public 58 health systems can prepare for emergency response. 59",

The WHO estimates [19] that in India, 80% of the 167 infections are currently asymptomatic or mild,15% are severe enough to require 168 hospitalisation and 5% need critical care (ICU with ventilator). By extension, this would 169 translate to a public health requirement of at least 2,382,042 hospital beds for sever or critical 170 patients at the projected peak of infection by first week of August 2020. The state of 171 Telangana currently has 277,850 hospital beds. 172 Projections of COVID19 spread for Telangana from SIR Model 174 shows that the R0 parameter value of 3 fits the initial observed cases quite well.

R0 > 1 indicates that the outbreak will continue to yield increasing 127 number of infections unless effective control measures are implemented, while R0 < 1 indicates 128 that the number of new cases decreases over time and, eventually, the outbreak will end. Thus, 129 R0 is a time-varying measure whose periodic assessment during an epidemic informs 130 policymakers on the need for and effectiveness of interventions. We obtained projections for 131 infections and mortality by calculating R0 by least squares optimisation and also based on a 132 range of values from 0.07 to0.17 [14] for three different phases of nonpharmaceutical 133 intervention (NPI) launched by policy makers in the state of Telangana.

Thus, the city is one of the high-risk areas for 240 COVID-19 transmission. Other than being in the time of a highly transmissible virus-like 241 COVID-19, the city has a high population density with 18,172 persons per Sq. Km [28]. 242 One of the limitations of this work is the lack of discrimination between urban and rural 243 areas. This was deliberate as at the time of collating data, reports stratified by level of 244 urbanization were not very reliable. However, the possibility of the infection/epidemic 245 already moving beyond the city perimeter to other districts or rural parts of the state cannot 246 be ignored. 247 It is well known that with the availability of new information, in recent years, the country 248 changed epidemic estimates for other epidemics like HIV and TB [29,30]. Also historical 249 experiences from earlier outbreaks [31 should be combined with new estimates to inform 250 effective interventions. Any scientific estimation needs robust local data. COVID-19 is new, 251and as one moves in time, more evidence will be available for better estimations. 252The authors would like to emphasise that, these are population level projections. The inherent 253 assumptions will not address micro clusters such as health workers, the modelling does not 254 adjust for vulnerable groups and loci that may be high risk locations such as hospitals. At the 255 present time more data is needed to clearly understand the differential transmission dynamics 256in special groups.The model does not have the ability to project precisely what may happen 257 after the lockdown is lifted, previous experience with the 1918 Influenza pandemic [31] 258 suggests that many different possibilities exist. Measures such as lockdown are considered as 259 drastic public health measures with their long-term benefits unclear but may also have varied 260 impact on the society [32-34]. 261 262",
