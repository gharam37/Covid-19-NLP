The disease has rapidly spread globally, the first case in India being detected on 30 th January, 2020. Since then, several research groups have been working in predicting COVID-19 cases and their consequences in India. Till date, Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) models has been widely used in predicting the course of epidemics [2] . SIR models are epidemic simulation models which divide the population into 3 compartments of Susceptible, Infectious and Recovered groups and assume a defined rate of transition between them. Variation of SIR model is the SEIR model which includes another compartment \"Exposed\" in the model [3] .",

However, detection and response capacity of COVID-19 cases globally vary across all countries [4] . In a country like India with a varied administrative set-up and state policies, healthcare amenities vary even further [5] . Amidst measures like \"Lock-down\", Social distancing and Sanitization being used to reduce the peak number of COVID-19 cases [6] in India, we extended the SIR model to a SEIQHRF (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Quarantined-Hospitalised-Recovered-Fatal) model [7] to take in account the healthcare capacity of that state. As a proof of concept study, we ran the SEIQHRF model on Kasargod [8] , the most affected district in Kerala, the state with best healthcare capacity in India [9] .",

Extending the duration of SD to a continuous of 5 weeks also delayed the peak prevalence without showing obvious impact on I and F compartments. Surprisingly, doubling the hospital bed capacity had little impact of the peak prevalence of the I and F compartments ( Figure 3B ), probably due to the overwhelming number of patients compared to the bed capacity.",

The peak prevalence is drastically reduced on increasing the detection rate by 3 times and further reduced if increased by 5 times ( Figure 4A ). The reduction in peak prevalence of the Fatal (F) compartment was also similar ( Figure 4B ). Continuous SD for 5 weeks with a detection rate of 1/5 (1 out of 5 cases daily gets detected and quarantined) has an enormous effect on reducing peak prevalence and also provides enough time window for healthcare capacity building for the upcoming burden of hospitalization. However, such prolonged lock-down would have a significant negative impact on the economy as well as mental wellbeing. Considering this, we finally tested whether a continuous SD for 5 weeks or SD for 6 weeks with a gap of 1 week is more effective in reducing the burden of cases. Here we saw that the later approach of SD for 3 weeks followed by a release of 1 week and reintroducing SD for 3 weeks again reduced the peak prevalence of Infectious cases by less than a half compared to the baseline model ( Figure 4A ). This intervention not only reduced the peak burden of both I and F compartment but also delayed it.",

These measures are also accompanied by increasing bed capacity to decrease severe as well as the fatal cases. However, for an effective mitigation of an epidemic, detection of unidentified cases with mild and no-symptoms who can expose a large population is of utmost importance. Indeed, a recent study has shown that 86% of all infections were undocumented and thus could be implicated to the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 [17] . Using a Stochastic Computational Simulation Model, we find that a reduction in Infectious (I) and Fatal (F) COVID-19 cases is possible through increased case detection in addition to implementing SD and increasing the number of hospital beds.

With the present pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 the global scientific community is still grappling for evidence based, cost effective & sustainable interventions. The best strategy to address the pandemic would only be understood in retrospect, once the storm has blown over. Presently every country is battling, using fundamental process of problem solving 'trial & error' method in the middle of the pandemic. Intelligence sharing with quality data management across the countries and globe would help the cause. Different countries are apparently in different stages of the pandemic; distribution, transmission and outcomes are not uniform for all the countries. Daily confirmed cases vary from 3/million in India to 2816/million population in Spain. Death rates, age and sex distribution, severity pattern are also not same everywhere [19] . The only pattern remaining constant since its inception is the upward curve of the cases in almost all the countries. Given the diabolical nature of the pandemic with prevailing uncertainty over the natural history of the disease and absence of a specific cure or vaccine, panic and anxiety over the disease is ever increasing. In this context do we propose that key to success lies in the detection of cases at the earliest. Even though we do not have a specific pharmacotherapy as yet, non pharmaceutical interventions in addition to that would help to mitigate the situation. Case detection and tracking of the close contacts followed by immediate quarantine measures will eventually help in breaking the chain of transmission.",

The disease propagation follows a somewhat fractal pattern, affecting a cluster of close contacts of a case in a locality and later spreads to other regions. Till the clusters coalesce, disease is localised in smaller localities and that is the best opportunity for our ongoing intervention to work. In South Korea almost 2/3 rd of the cases occurred in one particular region of Daegu. While overall incidence is around 19/100000 in the country, Daegu records incidence of 278/100000. Data also shows that only 17% cases were documented as sporadic cases and rest were considered to have occurred in clusters; 50% of that too in one cluster [20] . Hence the spread of the disease is not uniform or homogeneous. Current evidence shows a fall in number of new cases in the recent past in that country. Interestingly, in India also 4 states contribute to about half of all the cases.",
