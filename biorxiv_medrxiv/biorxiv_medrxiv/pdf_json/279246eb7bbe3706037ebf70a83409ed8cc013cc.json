            "text": "With large numbers of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation and ventilators being in short supply, in extremis two patients are having to share one ventilator. This possibility has been discussed for at least two decades, and careful matching of patient ventilation requirements is advised. However, with a large range of lung compliance and other characteristics, which may also vary with time, good matching is difficult to achieve. Adjusting the impedance of the flow path between ventilator and patient gives the opportunity to control the airway pressure and hence flow and volume individually for each patient. Several groups are now investigating this, in particular the addition of a flow restrictor in the inspiration tube for the patient who is more compliant, or requires a lower tidal volume. In this paper, we show that a simple linear resistance-compliance model, termed the BathRC model, of the ventilator tubing system and lung allows direct calculation of the relationships between pressures, volumes, and required flow restriction. The BathRC model is experimentally validated using a GE Aisys CS2 ventilator connected to two test lungs. The pressureflow relationships for two restrictors are experimentally determined, and despite the need to approximate them with a linear resistance characteristic, their effect in the breathing circuit is accurately predicted by the simple model. The BathRC model is freely available for download; we do not condone dual ventilation, but this tool is provided to demonstrate that flow restriction can be readily estimated. This research is part of a larger test, simulation and design investigation on dual ventilation being undertaken at the UoB and RUH.",

            "text": "Modern ventilators often use a circle anaesthetic breathing system to supply oxygen-enriched air or anaesthetic gases to the patient via an inspiration tube, with expiratory gas returning via a separate expiration tube; exhaled carbon dioxide is either absorbed by an alkali or spilt out of an overflow valve. The splitting of both inspiratory and expiratory tubes, to allow two patients to be ventilated by the same ventilator, has been suggested a number of times, for example in Neyman & Irvin, 2006, and Paladino et al, 2008 . However, the potential for cross-flows between patients is a serious concern, and the ability to precisely control pressure and or/flow to each patient is lost. The former problem can be addressed by including additional non-return valves within each of the inspiration and expiration tubes. This has the effect of not only reducing gas contamination between patients, but also of reducing system dead-space for each half of the system, and the potential for CO2 rebreathing. A method of achieving individual control has not been demonstrated in practice, and COVID-19 patients require ventilation accurately tailored to their needs. In severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), lung compliance can often reduce significantly, although evidence is emerging that COVID-19 is atypical in this regard (Gattinoni, 2020) .",

In March 2020, this approach was introduced in New York, adopting the 'Columbia Protocol ' [1] . This relies on careful matching of patient characteristics, and its effectiveness would be sensitive to changes in in patient compliance. A new experimental study by Tronstad et al (2020) in relation to COVID-19 concludes: \"We found large discrepancies in delivered tidal volumes for paired test lungs with compliance differences, little influence from differences in airway resistances, and that higher PEEP settings could strongly influence the tidal volume balance between the test lungs. \u2026 From this study and from a technical point of view, we were not able to identify reliable settings, adjustments or any simple measures to overcome the hazards of the technique.\"",

Increasing the resistance in the inspiration tube for the patient with the higher lung compliance or requiring a lower tidal volume seems plausible. This is the subject of this paper. A team from Hospital Geel, Belgium, have been experimenting with the same technique [2], and a simulation study has been published from a group in (mostly) London, UK, in the last few days (Sol\u00eds-Lemus et al, 2020) .

Characterising lung mechanical properties using resistance and compliance has become common-place, and estimated values are available from studies such as Arnal et al 2018, although other modelling approaches are possible as reviewed in Carvalho and Zin, 2011 . Mechanical ventilation and other breathing equipment has been modelled and simulated at the University of Bath since the late 1980's. This has included detailed component modelling and validation (Jones, 2002) , and complete system models reported in Wilson et al, 2009 . Models were developed using the in-house software tool, Bathfp, and used to extensively study low flow breathing systems by Magee, 2014 . However, the hypothesis in this paper is that a very simple model is sufficient to predict behaviour adequately, and has the benefit of an analytical solution allowing direct calculation of the flow restrictor resistance required to achieve a specified tidal volume.",

Similarly, peak negative (expiration) flow occurs at the start of the expiration phase. It can be seen that the flows for lung 1 are slightly more than lung 2, resulting in a higher tidal volume as seen in Table 2 . The model lung volume variations in Figure 10b for lung 1, and Figure 10c for lung 2, match the measured signals well.

Comparing lung 1 flow without and with the fixed restrictor -Test 4 ( Figure 13 ) and Test 5 ( Figure 14) -shows the expected reduction in flow and a tidal volume drop of 20%, again associated with a small increase in lung 2 tidal volume (6%). An issue which can be seen in the flow plots in Figures 13a and 14a is the lung 1 flow measurement at around 4 s, where the flow sudden becomes zero. This is a low-flow drop out characteristic of that specific flow meter, but the influence on results is thought to be small. Table 2 , the RC model predicts the tidal volumes reasonably well for this range of conditions. For lung 1, in the five tests the measured tidal volume deviates from the predicted by 2.4%, -3.6%, 3.5%, -5.6% and-9.3% respectively. For lung 2, the measured tidal volume deviates from the predicted by 1.4%, 4.9%, 6.3%, -4.4% and 1.4% respectively. The largest absolute error is 31 mL.

To succeed, we believe it is essential to independently control the gas flow (tidal volume) that each patient receives. A possible solution is to use a flow restrictor in the line of a patient who would otherwise receive too much pressure or flow, resulting in barotrauma or volutrauma. Such a restrictor should ideally be adjustable. We have presented experimental results using a pair of test lungs showing that restricting the flow in one inspiration line does indeed reduce the tidal volume in the corresponding lung. Moreover, using a linear resistance-compliance network model, we have shown that the change of tidal volume can be predicted. In the five tests presented, the largest prediction error was 31 mL of tidal volume. In the form used, the model just needs an airway resistance and lung compliance estimate for each patient, and a resistance and compliance value for the ventilator tubing system. Likewise, an added flow restrictor should be characterised by a linear resistance i.e. a pressure drop proportional to flowrate. The good performance of the model is despite clear linearization errors for the two flow restrictors used in this study. All the parameter values used have been informed by individual component testing.",

While this will mean the characteristics of the dual arrangement are markedly different from conventional single patient ventilation, the increased pressure loss within the flow path means that the airway flow and pressure will be less sensitive to changes in patient characteristics. 2) An unexpected result was that as the flow reduced to one test lung by the introduction of a flow restrictor, there was a small increase in flow to the other lung. For example, the most severe flow restrictor reduced tidal volume by 36% in the corresponding lung, but also caused the unaltered loop to provide 5% more volume to the other test lung. This is likely to be caused by the reduced pressure loss in the common part of the circuit at the ventilator, and effects within the ventilator itself. 3) Test lung 1 appears to have different time constants for inspiration and expiration, and the modelling approach would allow different inspiration and expiration airway resistances to be used to capture this and improve accuracy. As a general method however, minimising the number of parameters required is beneficial.",

The 3D printed designs that are emerging need to be proven to be inert, sterilisable, and durable in the breathing system environment. The fixed restrictor used in this study -in fact a non-return valve -is medically approved, and provided around 10% differentiation between the two loops.
