The outbreak of the virus along the time has become a massive threat to the global public health security and has been declared as a pandemic. Accounting the radical number of increases in the infected cases and the death due to COVID-19 infections around the globe, there is a need to predict the infections among the people by making proper optimization and using various Infectious Disease modelling (IDM) methods, in order to challenge the outcome. In comparison with previous diseases like SARS and Ebola viruses, the new corona virus infections are infectious during the incubation period. In addition to that, naturally produced droplets from humans (e.g. droplets produced by breathing, talking, sneezing, coughing) and Person-to-person contact transmission are reported to be the foremost ways of transmission of novel corona virus.",

It is noticed that severe illness and deaths are more common among the ageing population with other chronic pre-existing conditions.

Several reports (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020; WHO, 2020) claims that the source of the infection of the COVID-19 comes from wild animals.

Various researches have been conducted on SEIR models which are presented in detail in (Sun, C., Hsieh, Y., 2010; Yi, N., Zhang, Q., Mao, K., Yang, D., Li, Q., 2009; Zhang, J., Li., Ma, Z., 2006; Zhou, X., Cui, J., 2011) . Treating such deadly disease such as SARS, measles, flue and tuberculosis this model played a significant role in controlling or decreasing the spread of the infections in the specified study region. More recent work on the effect of treatment on the dynamic behavior can be found in (Tang, Zhou., Li, Xianbin., Li, Houqiang., 2020; Wang, J., Liu, S., Zheng, B., Takeuchi, Y., 2012; Wendi, 2006) . Contrastingly, in traditional epidemic models, the treatment rate is presumed to be proportionate to the number of infective, which is almost not possible in reality. Therefore, in this paper assuming that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isolation measures during the illness, will not be suitable for the current situation as the COVID-19 is infectious even during its incubation period. Hence, this article first describes, 1. A modified SEIR model.",

Therefore, the rate of change in the states of the SIER parameter will depend on the past state and not only on the current state. Specifically, during the analysis of the modified SIER model, the present number of infections ( ( )) which depends on the time constraints is considered as two fragments. One was transferred by the human carrying the incubating COVID-19 virus and the other is the number of confirmed humans who are infected with the virus at the time interval ' '.

It can be seen from Figure 1 that the epidemic situation starts to concentrate in about 90 days. It can be seen that the number of infected people will reach its peak in about 120 days. Secondly, while considering the second case of prediction in the case of enacted governmental policies like quarantine precautions, hand sanitizing, social distancing and avoiding the crowd in public places, the Figure. 2 shows the predicted results. From the predicted results, it is obvious that, the number of infected people may reach 13, 24 and 470 only in 220 days and will eventually come to an end after 250 days from the period of initial consideration.",

            "text": "On the one hand, since February 21, 2020, all the countries across the globe have been adopting strict isolation and precautionary measures, and on the other hand, Wuhan has closed all public transportation facilities, air travel, parks and almost a complete lock down since January 20, 2020. From the previous news articles and the managements reports, China's response to the epidemic can be seen in three stages: first stage is to control the primary source of infection and discard the transmission chains around all the areas in Hubei Province; second stage is to vigorously treat infected patients and reduce mortality; and the third stage is to control the epidemic condition, thoroughly contain the disease epidemic, and drastically reduce the contact ratio between human population. In this article, the path of the curve is simulated by a time-lapse modified SEIR model. The model prediction shows that without any governmental policies or control measures, the peak of infected human will reach about 25, 81, 190 when the average daily number of contacts per infected person is = 5. Therefore, it is recognised that the Tamil Nadu Government and the Ministry of Health takes strict control and precautionary measures from March 22, 2020. Hence, the number of people infected will be greatly reduced which is expected to be by the simulated model as 13, 24 and 470 of the total population of Tamil Nadu. Therefore, local government authorities and public health departments should emphasise their efforts on controlling the source of infection and delink the maximum possible transmission chains, such as increasing the sample number of testing which leads to the early detection of the infected person, screening of the latent humans which finds its way to early isolation, and early preparedness for treating the infected humans expected to come, to highly cut down the gathering of large groups of people, and to regularly and completely ban the use of public toilets and public utility areas. Importantly the policies are to me made in such a way that, it should strictly impose on the \"Three Cs\" -Closed and Crowded places and Conversations in close proximity to the public thereby creating a awareness to avoid the community transmission of the COVID-19.",
