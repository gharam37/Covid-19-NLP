A main challenge for short-term forecasts is the assessment of key epidemiological parameters and how they change as first governmental intervention measures are showing an effect. By combining an established epidemiological model with Bayesian inference, we analyze the time dependence of the effective growth rate of new infections. For the case of COVID-19 spreading in Germany, we detect change points in the effective growth rate that correlate well with the times of publicly announced interventions. Thereby, we can (a) quantify the effects of recent governmental measures to mitigating the disease spread, and (b) incorporate the corresponding change points to forecast future scenarios and case numbers. Our code is freely available and can be readily adapted to any country or region.",

To contain the disease spread, and turn from exponential growth to a decline of novel cases, a further decrease in \u03bb is necessary.

Thus, any uncertainty on the magnitude of our social distancing in the past two weeks can have a major impact on the case numbers in the next two weeks. Beyond two weeks, the case numbers depend on our future behavior, for which we have to make explicit assumptions.

Thereby, the efficiency of political and individual measures for social distancing and containment can be assessed in a timely manner. We find first evidence for a successive decrease of the spreading rate in Germany around March 9 and around March 16, which significantly reduced the magnitude of exponential growth, but was not sufficient to turn growth into decay. The development in the coming week will reveal the efficiency of the contact ban initiated on March 23. In general, our analysis code may help to infer the efficiency of measures taken in other countries and inform policy makers about tightening, loosening and selecting appropriate rules for containment. Inference of change points in the spreading rate \u03bb from confirmed COVID-19 cases in Germany. A: Prior (blue) and posterior (orange) distributions for five of the central parameters of an SIR model with two change points (at time t1 and t2), where the spreading rate changes from \u03bb0 \u2192 \u03bb1 \u2192 \u03bb2. B: The inferred growth rate \u03bb * , i.e. the difference between spreading and recovery rate (\u03bb * = \u03bb \u2212 \u00b5) for an SIR model that assumes scenarios with one, two or three change points (red, orange, green; fitted to case reports until March 25, April 1 and April 9, respectively). The timing of the inferred change points corresponds well to the timing of the governmental interventions in Germany (depicted as * ). C,D: The model-fit of the new confirmed cases and (cumulative) total confirmed cases is depicted for the models with one, two or three change points. The three scenarios depend strongly on whether one includes the third change point or not: the number of new confirmed cases grow exponentially (red, orange) or are approximately constant (green). This illustrates that the future development depends strongly on our distancing behavior. B,C: Note the delay D between change point (i.e. change in spreading behavior) and observation of confirmed cases of almost two weeks.",

            "text": "During the initial outbreak of an epidemic, reliable short-term forecasts are key to estimate required medical capacities, and to inform and advice the public and decision makers [1] . During this initial phase, three tasks are of particular importance to provide time-critical information for crisis mitigation: (1) establishing central epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproduction number that can be used for short-term forecasting; (2) simulating the effects of different possible interventions aimed at the mitigation of the outbreak; (3) estimating the actual effects of the measures taken -to rapidly adjust them and to adapt short-term forecasts. Tackling these tasks is challenging due to the large statistical and systematic errors that are present during the initial stages of an epidemic with its low case numbers. This is further complicated by the fact that mitigation measures are taken rapidly, while the outbreak unfolds, but they take an effect only after an a priori unknown delay. To obtain reasonable parameter estimates for short-term forecasting and policy evaluation despite these complications, any prior knowledge available needs to be integrated into modeling efforts to reduce uncertainties. This includes knowledge about basic mechanisms of disease transmission, recovery, as well as preliminary estimates of epidemiological parameters from other countries, or from closely related pathogens. The integration of prior knowledge, the quantitative assessment of the remaining uncertainties about epidemiological parameters, and the principled propagation of these uncertainties into forecasts is the domain of Bayesian modeling and inference [2, 3] .",

This simple model can be formulated in terms of coupled ordinary differential equations (in mean field), which enable analytical treatment [8, 9] or fast evaluation (ideally suited for Bayesian inference). Accordingly, SIR-like models have been used to model epidemic spreads, from Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) parameter estimation [10] [11] [12] to detailed scenario discussions [13] [14] [15] [16] . Recently, this family of models also played a dominant role in the analyses of the global corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, from inference [17] [18] [19] to scenario forecast [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] to control strategies [28, 29] .",

First, the spreading rate decreased from 0. 40 This corresponds well to the strict contact ban, which was announced on March 22.

In Germany, first serious interventions occurred around March 9 and affected the case reports with an observation delay, a combination of incubation period with median 5 \u2212 6 days [32] and a test delay (time until doctor is visited plus test-evaluation time) that we assume to be about 2 days.

Converted to the basic reproduction number R 0 = \u03bb/\u00b5, we find a median R 0 = 3.4 (CI [2.4, 4.7]), which is consistent with previous reports that find median values between 2.3 and 3.3 [18, 33, 34] . Overall, the model shows good agreement for both new cases C t (Fig. 1 A) and the cumulative cases t t =0 C t (Fig. 1 B) with the expected exponential growth (linear in lin-log plot). The absolute deviation between data and model ( Fig. 1 C) is well captured by the case-number-dependent width of our likelihood (Methods) motivated by demographic noise in mean-field models of spreading processes [35, 36] . The observed data are clearly informative about \u03bb, I 0 and \u03c3 (indicated by the difference between the priors (gray line) and posteriors (histograms) in Fig. 1 D,I,H) .

As long as the number of infections and recoveries are small compared to the population size, the number of active infections per day can be approximated by an exponential growth (Fig. 1A ,B) with effective growth rate \u03bb * = \u03bb \u2212 \u00b5 (see Methods). As a consequence, \u03bb and \u00b5 cannot be estimated independently. This is further supported by a systematic scan of the model's log-likelihood in the \u03bb-\u00b5 space that shows an equipotential line for the maximum likelihood ( Fig. 1 J) . This strongly suggests that the growth rate \u03bb * is the relevant free parameter with a median \u03bb * = 28% (Fig. 1 I) . The control parameter of the dynamics in the exponential phase is thus the (effective) growth rate: If the growth rate is larger than zero (\u03bb > \u00b5), case numbers grow exponentially; if the growth rate is smaller than zero (\u03bb < \u00b5), the recovery dominates and the new confirmed cases decrease. The two different dynamics (supercritical and subcritical, respectively) are separated by a critical point at \u03bb * = 0 (\u03bb = \u00b5) [36] .",

Hypothetical interventions build on the inferred parameters from the initial phase ( Fig. 1 , in particular median \u03bb 0 = 0.41 and median \u00b5 = 0.12) and were implemented as change points in the spreading rate from the inferred \u03bb 0 to a new value \u03bb 1 . With such a change point, we model three potential scenarios of public behavior: (I) No social distancing; Public behavior is unaltered and the spread continues with the inferred rate (\u03bb 1 = \u03bb 0 with median \u03bb 1 = 0.41 > \u00b5). (II) Mild social distancing; The spreading rate decreases to 50%, (\u03bb 1 = \u03bb 0 / 2 with median \u03bb 1 = 0.21 > \u00b5). Although people effectively reduce the number of contacts by a factor of two in this second scenario, the total number of reported cases continues to grow alongside scenario (I) for the time period of the reporting delay D (median D = 8.6 from initial phase, see below for a more constrained estimation).

A second change point (\u03bb 1 \u2192 \u03bb 2 ) is expected around March 16 (t 2 ), when schools and many stores were closed. A third change point (\u03bb 2 \u2192 \u03bb 3 ) is expected around March 23 (t 3 ), when all non-essential stores were closed, and a contact ban was enacted. We expect the behavioral changes introduced at these change points to unfold over a few days \u2206t i , however, changes in duration can be partly compensated by changes in the onset time t i (see Fig. 2 E,F, scenarios).

Such a transient decrease of new cases, before increasing again, originates from changing an exponential growth rate over small time-interval in the model. It is consistent with the observed temporary drop in newly confirmed cases and suggests a rapid implementation of mitigation measures by the public. However, we also observed a spread in the data points that was somewhat larger than expected by the model. We assign this to the fact that in the main model we did not incorporate an additional prior describing uncertainty and noise that is introduced by fluctuations in reporting (less reports on weekends, availability of test kits, etc.) -however, we verified that our results are consistent when we extend our main model to account for the week-related alterations ( Fig. S3  and S5 ).

We showed that change points in the spreading rate affect the confirmed case numbers with a delay of about two weeks (median reporting delay of D = 9.3 days plus a median duration of changes of 3 days). Thereby, we were able to relate the inferred change points to the three major governmental interventions in Germany: We found a clear reduction of the spreading rate related to each governmental intervention (Fig. 3) , (i) the cancellation of large events with more than 1000 participants (around March 9), (ii) the closing of schools, childcare centers and the majority of stores (in effect March 16), and (iii) the contact ban and closing of all non-essential stores (in effect March 23).",

Our results show that this main model is currently sufficient for Germany: While we introduced fairly broad priors on the spreading rates, we obtained fairly narrow posterior distributions for each spreading rate \u03bb i (Fig. 3) . We additionally evaluated obvious extensions of our main model with three change points by excluding weekend data that may suffer from under-reporting (Fig. S3) , and by using the more involved model that includes the four classes: susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered (Fig. S4 ). All of these models yield consistent results for the three change points, and all have LOO scores within one standard error of each other.

In countries where drastic changes in test coverage are expected this will have to be included as well. The methodology presented here is capable in principle of incorporating such details. It also lends itself to modeling of continuous drifts in the spreading rate, e.g. reflecting reactions of the public to news coverage of a catastrophic situation, or people growing tired of mitigation measures. Such further adaptations, however, can only be performed on a per-country basis by experts with an intimate knowledge of the local situation. Our code provides a solid and extensible base for this. For Germany, several developments in the near future may have to be included in the model. First, people may transiently change their behavior over the Easter holidays; second, we expect a series of change points, as well as continuous drifts, with governments trying to ease and calibrate mitigation measures.",

The delay D, together with the time required to implement interventions causes a total delay between an intervention and its visibility in the case numbers of about two weeks for COVID-19 in Germany. This means that changes in our behavior today can only be detected in confirmed cases in two weeks.

We therefore chose informative priors on initial model parameters where possible and complemented them with uninformative priors otherwise. Our choices are summarized in Tab. III for the simple model, SIR model with stationary spreading rate for the exponential onset phase, and in Tab. IV for the full model with change points, and justified in the following. Priors for the simple model (Table III) : In order to constrain our simple model, an SIR model with stationary spreading rate for the exponential onset phase, we chose the following informative priors. Because of the ambiguity between the spreading and recovery rate in the exponential onset phase (see description of simple model), we chose a narrow log-normal prior for the recovery rate \u00b5 \u223c LogNormal(log(1/8), 0.2) with median recovery time of 8 days [20] . Note that, our implementation of \u00b5 accounts for the recovery of infected people and isolation measures because it describes the duration during which a person can infect others. For the spreading rate, we assume a broad log-normal prior distribution \u03bb \u223c LogNormal(log(0.4), 0.5) with median 0.4. This way, the prior for \u03bb \u2212 \u00b5 has median 0.275 and the prior for the base reproduction number (R 0 = \u03bb/\u00b5) has median 3.2, consistent with the broad range of previous estimates [18, 33, 34] . In addition, we chose a log-normal prior for the reporting delay D \u223c LogNormal(log(8), 0.2) to incorporate both the incubation time between 1-14 days with median 5 [32] plus a delay from infected people waiting to contact the doctor and get tested.",
