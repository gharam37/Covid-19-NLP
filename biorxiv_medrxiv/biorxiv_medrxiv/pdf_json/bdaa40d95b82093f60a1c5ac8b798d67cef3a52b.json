We present 65 peptide sequences that we expect to result in a safe and effective vaccine which can be rapidly tested in DNA, mRNA, or synthetic peptide constructs. These include epitopes that are contained within evolutionarily divergent regions of the spike protein reported to increase infectivity through increased binding to the ACE2 receptor, and within a novel furin cleavage site thought to increase membrane fusion. This vaccination strategy specifically targets unique vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2 and should engage a robust adaptive immune response in the vast majority of the human population. author/funder.

We present a list of viral antigen minigenes for use in a multivalent vaccine construct that can be delivered by scalable techniques such as DNA, nucleoside mRNA, or synthetic peptides. SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus in the past two decades to acquire infectivity in humans and result in regional epidemics, with SARS-CoV-2 causing a global pandemic. The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 dictates species tropism and is thought to bind to ACE2 receptors with 10-20-fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV in humans (Walls et al.; Wrapp et al., 2020) . In addition, cleavage at a novel furin insertion site is predicted to facilitated membrane fusion and confer increased virulence, as has been previously reported with other viruses (Chen et al., 1998) . Based on initial reports, infection of ACE2-expressing pneumocytes lining the pulmonary alveoli likely impairs release of surfactants that maintain surface tension, hindering the ability to prevent accumulation of fluid that may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (Xu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . The immune response of convalescent COVID-19 patients consists of antibody-secreting cells releasing IgG and IgM antibodies, increased follicular helper T cells, and activated CD4 and CD8 T cells (Thevarajan et al., 2020) , suggesting that a broad humoral and T cell driven immune response mediates the clearance of infection. The large size of the SARS-CoV-2 (~29kb) suggests that selection of optimal epitopes and reduction of unnecessary antigenic load for vaccination will be essential for safety and efficacy.",

ADE mechanisms have been described with other members of the Coronaviridae family (Wan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2016) , and it has already been suggested that some of the heterogeneity in COVID-19 cases may be due to ADE from prior infection from other viruses in the coronavirus family (Tetro, 2020) . We suggest that although the T cell epitopes presented here are expected to be safe in vaccination, B cell epitopes should be further evaluated for their ability to induce neutralizing antibodies as compared to their potential to induce ADE. As it has been shown that T helper (T H ) cell responses are essential in humoral immune memory response (Alspach et al., 2019; McHeyzer-Williams, Okitsu, Wang, & McHeyzer-Williams, 2012) , we expect that the T cell epitopes presented here will activate a CD4 T cells and drive memory B cell formation when paired with matched B cell epitopes.",

Therefore, individual epitopes may be presented in a mutually exclusive manner across individuals, confounding the ability to immunize with broadly presented antigens. While T cell receptors (TCRs) recognize linearized peptides anchored in the MHC groove, B cell receptors (BCRs) can recognize both linear and conformational epitopes, and are therefore difficult to predict without prior knowledge of a protein structure. Here we describe an approach for prioritizing viral epitopes and present a list of peptides predicted to safely target the vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2, generating highly immunogenic epitopes on both MHC class I and II in the vast majority of the population, increasing the likelihood that prioritized epitopes will drive an adaptive memory response. author/funder.

We identified 3524 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes that are predicted to bind at least one HLA class I allele, with peptide FVNEFYAYL capable of binding 30 unique HLA alleles representing 90.2% of the US population ( Figure 1A , top; Table 1; Table S1 ). We tested various epitope sizes to maximize HLA presentation across the viral proteome, finding that 33 amino acid epitopes generated maximal population-scale HLA presentation, and suggest that these 33mers can be expressed in a multicistronic construct in dendritic cells to induce potent immune response across the vast majority of the population (An, Rodriguez, Harkins, Zhang, & Whitton, 2000; Lu et al., 2014) .

We show that viral epitope GEVFNATRFASVYAWNRKRISNCVADYSVLYNS derived from the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein (position 339-372) scores in the 90.9 th percentile of T epitopes and is the #3 of 1,546 epitopes scored in the S, E, and M genes for combined B and T cell epitopes, with presentation by MHC class I in 98.3% of the population ( Figures 1C/F & 2, red) . Additionally, a novel furin cleavage site has been reported in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, resulting in increased infectivity (Wrapp et al., 2020) . Indeed, we find that the epitope SYQTQTNSPRRARSVASQSIIAYTMSLGAENSV containing the RRAR furin cleavage site of the spike protein ranks in the 90.7 th percentile of T cell epitopes and ranks first of 1546 in combined B and T cell epitope, (Figures 1C/F & 2, orange), thereby targeting an additional evolutionary adaptation of SARS-CoV-2.

The methods described here provide a rapid workflow for evaluating and prioritizing safe and immunogenic regions of a viral genome for use in vaccination. With the third epidemic in the past two decades underway, and all originating from a coronavirus family virus, these viruses will continue to threaten the human population, and necessitate the need for prophylactic measures against future outbreaks. A subset of the epitopes selected here are derived from viral regions sharing a high degree of homology with other viruses in the family, and thus we expect these evolutionarily conserved regions to be essential in the infectivity and replicative lifecycle across the coronavirus family, suggesting that an immune response against the epitopes listed herein may provide more broadly protective immunity against other coronaviruses.",
