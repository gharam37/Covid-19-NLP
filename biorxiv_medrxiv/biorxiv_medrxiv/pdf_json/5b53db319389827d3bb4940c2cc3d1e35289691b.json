Through case cross design, personal characteristics and long-term and seasonal trends can be controlled (Lim et al., 2012) . GLM was also used in the studies of Onozuka et al. and Souza et al. (Souza et al., 2012; Onozuka et al., 2009) .

Chan et al., du Prel et al., Lin et al., Varela et al. use the autoregressive integral moving average (ARIMA) model to control the autocorrelation of time series data (Chan et al ., 2002; du Prel et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2009; Varela et al., 2004) .

Considering the three-month statistical cycle, the actual valid data is only 53. In the case of limited observations, there can be 4 parameters with obvious correlation. We have every reason to believe that, first, with the increase of effective observations, the statistical correlation between parameters will gradually appear; secondly, case increment is very sensitive to meteorological parameters, and analyzing cases with meteorological parameters is an effective method; thirdly, in addition to the minimum temperature, the other three parameters cannot establish a linear regression equation. Similarly, this study also uses the method of multiple linear regression analysis, but the overall fitting degree is very poor, the ultimate reason, it is not the problem of statistical method itself, but the effective observations for sudden infectious diseases is too little and the law is not obvious. 2019-nCoV evolution to seasonal infectious disease such as influenza virus is possible, if this happens, then periodic and repetitive data can be accumulated; meanwhile, this study finds that meteorological parameters, such as the minimum temperature and the average water vapor pressure, are the specific influencing factors of 2019-nCoV, this will become very meaningful for predicting the 2019-nCoV epidemic trend in the future.",

In the study of establishing influenza-related mortality model, it is found that the change of water vapor pressure is the root cause of seasonal trend, while RH prediction is relatively insufficient (Shaman et al., 2010) .It is also reported that AH(water vapor pressure) is better than RH in virus inactivation.

However, in our study because the effective time period was for 51 days, and in the epidemic area, the range of average minimum temperature was 18.10 \u00b0C (-3.6 ~ 14.5\u00b0C), the regression coefficient with statistical significance cannot be obtained, but the correlation analysis shows that it has positive and negative correlation with the average temperature, water vapor pressure and atmospheric pressure. In other words, the increment of cases is less sensitive to relative humidity. According to the data analysis results of the epidemic situation in Hubei province, under the subtropical monsoon climate conditions, the RH cannot be selected, and the vapor pressure should be selected as the parameter to analyze the influence relationship between the moisture in the air and the activity of the case.",

The time range is January 1 to March 10, 2020, and meteorological factors (parameters) are provided evidence of correlation with the incidence of COVID-19. Obviously, different indicators of climatic factors may completely affect the occurrence of the 2019-nCoV epidemic, and the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV is not accidental in time. Although this conclusion is derived from the process of COVID-19 confirmed case evolution in Hubei province of China, they still show that various results are compatible within the current knowledge range of the epidemic of 2019-nCoV. The meaning of this work is: (1) The decline in prevalence rate may be affected by the changes in meteorological factors that constrain viral transmission capacity;(2) climate change may slow down the rate of pandemic. Therefore, as for predicting epidemic scale and formulating prevention and control strategies in the process of 2019-nCoV global transmission, differences in meteorological factors should be taken into account, which will provide better preparation for the health care system worldwide; (3) As of March 10, 2020, a total of 67,773 confirmed cases had been reported in Hubei province, which was the worst-affected area in the world at that time. Our study has authority and credibility.Second, average atmospheric pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature and average water pressure may affect the development of epidemiological epidemic caused by 2019-nCoV. We analyzed from epidemiological statistics, the possible association of meteorological factors to the onset of COVID-19, and the influence of meteorological parameters on virus transmission and survival from virus causing respiratory diseases and explained the mechanism. On the basis of previous studies, the interaction theory of meteorological factors on the epidemic process of viral respiratory infectious diseases has been enriched and developed. In particular, for the first time, we have proved the epidemiological correlation between water vapor pressure and the COVID-2019, an extra-influenza respiratory tract infection (a new respiratory tract infection). We speculate that compared with non-coated virus, coated virus-2019-nCoV is more significant on climatic factors, especially temperature (including average temperature and minimum temperature). Previous studies have paid little attention to the effect of atmospheric viral respiratory infectious diseases. This study shows that there is a positive correlation between atmospheric pressure and the daily increase in the number of cases in 2019-nCoV, refreshing the cognition of the influence of meteorological factors on viral infectious diseases. Third, meteorological factors may affect the outcome of epidemiological epidemic caused by 2019-nCoV. Our research uses unary linear equation to explicate the linear relationship between incremental cases and the minimum temperature. The results show that the minimum temperature changes by 1 degree, and the incremental cases will change by 72 cases in the opposite direction, it can be predicted that the minimum temperature in Hubei province reaches 22 \u2103 , and the result of case increment is zero, which provides reference for the prevention, control and prediction of the epidemic situation of 2019-nCoV.",
