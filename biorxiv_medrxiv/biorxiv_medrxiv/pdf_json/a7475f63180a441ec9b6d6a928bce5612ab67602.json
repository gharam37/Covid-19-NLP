This number reached 2,872,097 in France and 924,892 28 persons in Germany. The proposed formulas also make it possible to evaluate the impact of 29 policies to prevent the spread of epidemic on the appearance of new cases.",

We offer a simple method using the number of deaths reported by each 12 country to estimate and compare the actual rate of people affected by Covid-19. This method 13 relies on three first assumptions: 1. The number of deaths reported by each country is reliable; 14 2. The fatality rate (Fr) is known and similar in different countries; 3. The average time 15 between the onset of symptoms and death is known (here considered 18 days). Based on these 16 assumptions, one can calculate the number of cases presented eighteen days before a given 17 day (t0). Two methods are then proposed to infer the number of cases, eighteen days later, at we proposed to use Fr-est = 2%.",

Note that some 7 authors suggest that the real fatality rate for Covid-19 could be 5.6 to 15.6% (Baud et al. 8 2020), which is much higher values than those we used. If the calculation uses a fatality rate 9 of 15%, then the estimated number of cases drops to 382,946 for France, but it becomes lower 10 than the number of cases actually reported for some countries (e.g. 2,242 versus 10,450 for 11 South Korea), which is not consistent (Table II) .",
