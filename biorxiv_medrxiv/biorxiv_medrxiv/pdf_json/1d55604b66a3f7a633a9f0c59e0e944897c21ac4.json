            "text": "Many enveloped viruses infect cells within endocytic compartments. The drop in pH that accompanies endosomal maturation, often in conjunction with proteolytic factors, serves as a trigger for viral fusion proteins to insert into the endosomal membrane and drive fusion. The dynamics of this process has been studied by tracking viruses within living cells, which limits the precision with which fusion can be synchronized and controlled, and by reconstituting viral fusion to synthetic membranes, which introduces non-physiological membrane curvature and composition. To overcome these limitations, we have engineered the chemically controllable triggering of single-virus fusion within endosomes. We isolate influenza virus:endosome conjugates from cells prior to fusion, immobilize them in a microfluidic flow cell, and then rapidly and controllably trigger fusion. This platform demonstrates lipid-mixing kinetics that are grossly similar to influenza fusion with model membranes but display some subtle differences. Because it preserves endosomal membrane asymmetry and protein composition, it also provides a means to test how perturbations to endosomal trafficking and cellular restriction factors affect viral membrane fusion.",

Such single-virus fusion measurements have been made observationally in living cells or in a chemically controllable manner between viruses and engineered target membranes [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . To better examine the effect of endosomal composition and geometry, we report a new strategy to measure singlevirus fusion within endosomes in a controllable manner. To achieve this, we isolated influenzacontaining endosomes from cells prior to fusion, immobilized them in a microfluidic flow cell, and monitored lipid mixing upon precise retriggering of fusion. This single-virus:endosome fusion assay permits direct comparison between viral fusion within endosomes and fusion to the exterior of liposomes or planar bilayers, where the membrane geometry and composition are not maintained. It thus helps elucidate the mechanistic determinants of fusion within cells as well as the role of cellular factors on the influenza virus:endosome fusion. The approach is easily generalizable to any enveloped virus that undergoes pH-triggered entry (such as dengue, Zika) and likely to other viruses such as Ebola and SARS that require pH in conjunction with endosomal factors to enter.

This combination was designed to achieve rapid pH drop inside the endosomes [28, 29] and was verified using pH-dependent fluorescence in synthetic liposomes (Fig. S2) . Lipid mixing between individual encapsulated virions and the surrounding endosomal membranes was measured by fluorescence dequenching (see Fig. 2 for a sample trace), and individual waiting times between pH drop and fluorescence dequenching compiled into a cumulative distribution function (CDF) (Fig. 3) . These measurements of isolated endosomes only assess lipid mixing directly, but based on similar ammonium chloride washout in cells and subsequent measurement of viral protein expression, full fusion likely occurs. Furthermore, fusion to any endosomal membrane within a single-or multi-vesicular body (see Fig. S3 ) will be sufficient to result in dequenching [30] .",

We demonstrate that the kinetics of lipid mixing between influenza viruses and these endosomes recapitulates viral fusion to the exterior of model liposomes, with the addition of a second, slow-fusing population of virus:endosome conjugates.

Endosomes were biotinylated by addition of 0.005% DPPE-biotin in solution and captured inside the flow cells by incubating 5 \u00b5l of endosome suspension for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. Biotin-avidin binding enabled tethering of endosomes to the glass surface of the flow-cell. Any unbound or loosely bound particles were removed by extensive rinsing of the flow cell with CBN. Low pH buffer was infused, and single virus-endosome lipid mixing events at 37 \u00b0C were monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Virus-liposome measurements were carried out analogously using 100-nm extruded liposomes composed of 67% POPC : 20% POPE : 10% cholesterol : 2% GD1a : 1% DPPE-biotin as described previously [25].

Lipid mixing kinetics between viral and endosomal membranes were measured as a function of time after pH drop. This system permits precise control of pH as well as characterization and manipulation of endosomal compartments not possible within living cells. Isolation of endosomes containing influenza virus. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) 21 cells were treated with 30 mM ammonium chloride prior to infection with X-31 (A/Aichi/68; H3N2) influenza virus at MOI of 1, to block endosomal acidification and subsequent viral fusion [27].

A cryo-EM image of an isolated endosome enclosing what is likely a virus is rendered in Figure 1b.

(a) Schematic representation of influenza virus entry into the host cell. Upon binding to the plasma membrane of the host cell, influenza is internalized by endocytosis and contained in early endosomes. Endosomal maturation is accompanied by luminal acidification. This drop in pH triggers fusion between viral and endosomal membranes, driven by influenza hemagglutinin, which in turn permits release of viral RNA into the host cytoplasm. (b) Representative cryo-EM image of a likely influenza surface-immobilized virus:endosome conjugates prior to triggering of fusion. The viral membrane is fluorescently labeled with Texas Red (TR) at self-quenching concentration to permit subsequent monitoring of fusion. The virus:endosome conjugate is immobilized by incorporation of biotin-PE and then binding to avidin:PLL-PEG-Biotin on a passivated glass coverslip. See Methods for details. (d) Representative epifluorescence microscopy images of virus:endosome conjugates. The red channel shows Texas Red in the viral membrane, and the green channel shows M6PR stained with a rabbit primary antibody and an Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibody. The merged image shows co-localization of virions (red) and endosomes (green) as yellow particles.",

Lipid mixing is identified as the rapid increase in fluorescence due to dilutional dequenching of the lipid dye.
