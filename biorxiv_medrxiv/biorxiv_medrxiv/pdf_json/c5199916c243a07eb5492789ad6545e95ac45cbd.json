We analyze the rate \u03b1 in different countries, choosing as a starting point in each country the first day with 30 cases and fitting for the following 12 days, capturing thus the early exponential growth in a rather homogeneous way. We look for a link between the rate \u03b1 and the average temperature T of each country, in the month of the epidemic growth. We analyze a base set of 42 countries, which developed the epidemic earlier, and an extended set of 88 countries, which developed the epidemic more recently. Fitting with a linear behavior \u03b1(T ), we find evidence in both datasets for a decreasing growth rate as a function of T , at 99.66%C.L. and 99.86%C.L. in the base and extended dataset, respectively. In the base set, going beyond a linear model, a peak at about (7.7 \u00b1 3.6) \u2022 C seems to be present in the data. Our findings give hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate should significantly decrease as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown policies. In general the propagation should be hopefully stopped by strong lockdown, testing and tracking policies, before the arrival of the next cold season.",

An important piece of information is whether the growth rate of the confirmed cases among the population could decrease with increasing temperature. Experimental research on related viruses found indeed a decrease at high temperature and humidity [1] . We try to address this question using available epidemiological data. A similar analysis for the data from January 20 to February 4, 2020, among 403 different Chinese cities, was performed in [2] and similar studies were recently performed in [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .

In the fit we used Poissonian errors, given by \u221a N , on the daily counting of cases. We associated then to each country an average temperature T , for the relevant weeks, which we took from [10]. More precisely: if for a given country the average T is tabulated only for its capital city, we directly used such a value. If, instead, more cities are present for a given country, we used an average of the temperatures of the main cities, weighted by their population [11] .

As an example the estimated doubling time, with the quadratic fit, at the peak temperature of 7.7 \u2022 C is of 2.6 days, while at 26 \u2022 C is expected to go to about 4.6 days. The linear fit gives a smaller effect: a doubling time of 2.8 days (or 3.1 days) at 7.7 \u2022 C and a doubling time of 4.1 days (or 4 days) at 26 \u2022 C, using the estimate from the base (or the extended) dataset. For countries with seasonal variations in the Southern Hemisphere, instead, this should give motivation to implement strong lockdown policies before the arrival of the cold season.",
