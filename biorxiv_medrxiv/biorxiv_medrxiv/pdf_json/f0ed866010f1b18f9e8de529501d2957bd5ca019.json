In addition, patients with comorbid hypertension, especially those with long-term oral ACEI/ARB medication for hypertension, might have different susceptibility and severity levels of pneumonia upon infection with SARS-COV-2. Therefore, we investigated and compared the demographic characteristics, coexisting diseases, severity of pneumonia, and the effect of antihypertensive drugs (ACEI/ARB versus non-ACEI/ARB) in COVID-19 patients with coexisting hypertension. Our findings may hopefully reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with hypertension in patients with COVID-19.",

This effect does not rely on the protease activity on ACE 10 . Structural analysis showed that the spinous protein of SARS-CoV was in contact with the head-end of the ACE2 catalytic domain subunit I, did not involve subunit II, and did not block the active region. Once SARS-CoV is connected to ACE2, the extracellular part of ACE2 will be lysed, and the transmembrane part will be transferred into the cell, which mediates further fusion of the virus particles and host cells 11 . Through next-generation sequencing technology, the entire genome sequence of COVID-19 has been successfully determined 12 .

ACEI/ARB drugs may increase the protein concentration of ACE2 in rat plasma, mRNA level of ACE2, and even the activity of ACE2 in cardiac tissue 14 . Thus, it is possible that those hypertensive patients who had been taking ACEI/ARB might have an increased level of mRNA and protein expression of ACE2 in the lungs, making them more vulnerable for SARS-COV-2 entry, as well as for development of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

This opinion mainly comes from animal model studies in multiple laboratories and a small sample clinical study. Studies have shown that ACE2 expression decreases after viral infection, causing acute lung injury; exogenous supplementation with ACE2 could alleviate acute lung injury 15 . Human recombinant ACE 2 (rhuACE2) and angiotensin II type 2 receptors protect mice from severe acute lung injuries induced by acid aspiration or sepsis 16 . It was found that patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who were treated with rhuACE2 injections had rapidly decreasing levels of Ang II and increasing levels of Ang1-7 17 . The down-regulation of ACE2 caused the imbalance of ACE/Ang II and ACE2 and the activity of Ang II in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) was enhanced because of the lack of antagonism 17 . Ang II mediates increased pulmonary vascular permeability by binding to receptor AT1, and might also cause pulmonary vascular contraction, resulting in hydrostatic pressure elevation and pulmonary edema 10, 17 .

Second, excessive inflammatory reactions due to the infection may also directly damage the integrity of the pulmonary capillary endothelial barrier, resulting in a massive increase of pulmonary vascular permeability and pulmonary edema, which appears as ground glass shadow on a chest CT18 .
