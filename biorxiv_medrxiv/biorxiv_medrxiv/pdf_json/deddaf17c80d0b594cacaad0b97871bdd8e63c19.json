The median time to clinical deterioration following hospital admission was 3 days (IQR 1-6).

We also included serum IL-6 and plasma d-dimer concentrations as independent variables in our models because there is emerging evidence of dysregulated immune activation and coagulopathy in patients with severe COVID-19, and interest in treating this patient population with targeted immunomodulatory therapies and anticoagulation. 13, 14 We confirmed the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox models using the Schoenfeld residuals test.

Sixty-percent (69/115) of patients who initially received respiratory support via non-rebreathing oxygen face mask, high-flow nasal cannula, or non-invasive ventilation ultimately received IMV. On the first day of critical illness, the median sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score 15 was 11 (IQR 8-13) and the median value of the lowest ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (P a O 2 ) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (F i O 2 ) recorded on this day was 129 (IQR 80-203). The median value of the highest positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) prescribed during the first 24 hours of IMV was 15 cm H 2 O (IQR 12-18) (Table 3). Among patients receiving IMV, advanced therapies for acute respiratory failure administered during hospitalization included early neuromuscular blockade (25%; 51/201), inhaled nitric oxide (11%, 22/201), prone-positioning ventilation (16%; 32/201), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (2%, 5/201). Over half (54%; 138/257) of patients required vasopressor support and nearly a third (29%; 75/257) required renal replacement therapy (RRT). Most patients received anti-viral agents (hydroxychloroquine [72%; 185/257] and remdesivir [9%; 23/257]) and anti-bacterial agents (89%; 229/257). Twenty-six percent (68/257) of patients received corticosteroids and 23% of patients (60/257) received anti-IL-6 receptor antagonists.",

Similar to other cardiometabolic co-morbidities, further studies are needed to better define an interaction, if any, between obesity and either susceptibility to or severity of COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine or remdesivir, agents which have shown activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, 27 were administered to over 70% of patients. Although the safety and efficacy of remdesivir among patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain, a recent uncontrolled observational study reported clinical improvement in 68% (36/53) of patients with severe COVID-19 who were administered the agent through compassionate use access. 28 However, adverse events were reported in 60% of patients, most commonly elevated transaminases. As the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in severe COVID-19 are unknown, the National Institutes of Health recently launched a blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the U.S. 29 In the absence of published clinical trial data for hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir, use of these agents should be decided on a case-bycase basis. Five percent of critically ill patients were HCWs. Although nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection cannot be determined with certainty given widespread community transmission, COVID-19related critical illness in these individuals highlights the risks facing frontline HCWs, such as in Italy, where over 15,000 HCWs have been infected as of April 11 th , 2020. 30 Continued and All rights reserved.
