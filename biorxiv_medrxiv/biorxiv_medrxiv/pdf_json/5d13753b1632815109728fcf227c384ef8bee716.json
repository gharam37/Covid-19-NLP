Both phases often overlapped in the different areas of the lungs, with plurifocal pattern of distribution. The fibrotic phase was rarely observed, possibly due to the short duration of the disease. Moreover, five patients also had bacterial (4) and fungal (1) abscesses. Table 1 reported all the morphological parameters, with the corresponding semiquantitative grading. Capillary congestion, interstitial oedema, dilated alveolar ducts, hyaline membranes composed of serum proteins and condensed fibrin, loss of pneumocytes were the histological patterns of the exudative phase mostly observed in all the cases. Platelet-fibrin thrombi in small arterial vessels (<1mm in diameter) were found in 33 cases. Moreover, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia showing reactive atypia, myofibroblast proliferation, alveolar granulation tissue and obliterating fibrosis were present in half of the patients but were focal. Microcystic honeycombing and mural fibrosis were occasionally present. The main histological features are reported in Figure   1 . ",

The peculiar histopathological findings were atypical pneumocytes (reactive atypia) and diffuse thrombosis of the peripheral small vessels. In our study, fibrin thrombi of small arterial vessels (diameter < 1mm) were observed in 33 /38 patients, half of them with >25% of tissue involvement and associated with high levels of D-dimer in blood. These findings might explain the severe hypoxemia which characterizes the clinical feature of ARDS in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Our data strongly support the hypothesis proposed by recent clinical studies, that COVID-19 is complicated or anyway strictly related to coagulopathy and thrombosis; moreover detection of D-dimer values >1 \u03bcg/ml have been associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19. For these reasons, the use of anticoagulants has been recently suggested as potentially beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19, albeit its efficacy and safety have not been demonstrated 9 .",

Other authors described pulmonary pathology of early-phase COVID-19 in two patients with lung carcinoma; both patients exhibited signs of the exudative phase of DAD 8 .
