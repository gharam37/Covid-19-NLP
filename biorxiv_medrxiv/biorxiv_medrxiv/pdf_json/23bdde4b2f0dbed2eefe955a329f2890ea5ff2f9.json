We evaluated ER patient classification for cardiac and infection causes with clinical data and chest X-ray image data. We show that a deep-learning model trained with an external image data set can be used to extract image features and improve the classification accuracy of a data set that does not contain enough image data to train a deeplearning model. We also conducted clinical feature importance analysis and identified the most important clinical features for ER patient classification. This model can be upgraded to include a SARS-CoV-2 specific classification with COVID-19 patients data. The current model is publicly available with an interface at the web link: http://nbttranslationalresearch.org/.",

There are many etiologies of acute dyspnea, but our model focused on distinguishing between two major categories: cardiac and infectious. Upon admission to a hospital emergency department, attending physicians must quickly determine which category the patient falls into. Typically these patients receive a suite of common clinical panels as well as a chest X-ray image early in the diagnostic process. We have developed a machine learning model capable of assisting ER physicians with categorizing the acute dyspnea given clinical values alone, or in conjunction with an X-ray image if one is available.",

Infectious causes of acute dyspnea include both pneumonia, an infectious process primary to the lungs, and sepsis, a systemic response to an infection anywhere in the body that can impair function in a variety of organs [1] . When severity is life-threatening, suspicion of these disease processes require empiric antibiotics. Other causes of acute dyspnea may fall into neither of these categories [1] , or a patient may have acute dyspnea with both cardiac and infectious contributions. See Figure 1 for examples of X-ray images for patients with neither label, \"infection\" label, and \"cardiac\" label, respectively.",

Though they are safe and efficacious when used judiciously, incautious use of antibiotic causes many problems for the patient and society as whole. Antibiotics have adverse effects in 1 out 5 patients [9] . Though these adverse effects often include direct side-effects from the drugs themselves, antibiotics can also produce adverse effects through their interactions with microorganisms [9] . Misuse of antibiotics can promote the growth of antibiotic resistant populations or cause an overgrowth of an opportunistic pathogen, such as Clostridium dificile [9] . However, in an ER setting, empiric antibiotics may need to be started without confirmation of infectious process that would benefit from antibiotic therapy [9] . In these instances, the risk of harm from not initiating antibiotics promptly is greater than the risk posed by the antibiotics themselves. This is largely due to the difficulty in excluding infectious processes from the diagnosis. Excluding serious infectious etiology of disease usually requires taking samples from the patient and waiting several days to see if bacteria grow from the sample. Our model represents a step toward more rapidly confirming or excluding infectious etiology, and thus reducing the unnecessary empiric prescription of antibiotics.",

Most of these approaches use deep neural networks [28] especially convolutional neural networks [29, 30] . Gradient boosted trees, and the XGBoost [3] model in particular, have been used to solve a wide variety of problems where the inputs may include very diverse variables of differing types [31] [32] [33] [34] .

Brain natriuretic peptide (B-NP) was rated by the model as its most important feature for predicting a cardiac cause of infection. Normal values for B-NP have been shown to have a high negative-predictive value for heart failure [5] and are used to diagnose exacerbation of existing heart failure [13] . Blood glucose levels are not directly associated with heart failure, but the model may be looking for associated diabetes mellitus. This common disease is an important risk factor for heart disease [6] . Increases in respiratory rate can be caused by heart failure exacerbations [13] , so it makes sense that this would be an important predictive feature.",

This suggests that, in our dataset, patients with cardiac causes of acute respiratory distress are more likely to also present with lactic acidosis than those with infectious causes, or that they are likely to develop lactic acidosis sooner.

In the cardiac labeling task, the combined model performed best in 4 out of 5 folds.
